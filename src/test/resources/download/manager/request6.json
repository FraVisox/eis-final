In 2019, Theresa May’s government committed the UK to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Since then, hundreds of local authorities have published plans to show how they intend to become carbon neutral. But analysis by the not-for-profit campaigning organisation Climate Emergency UK, shared exclusively with the Guardian, found that of the 409 local authorities across the UK, 84 still did not have climate action plans, while 139 had not committed to reach net zero emissions by a specific date. Climate Emergency UK scored 325 plans according to 28 questions grouped into nine categories, including how well councils’ plans would mitigate the impact of climate change locally, whether climate and ecological emergency was integrated into existing policies, community engagement, climate education, scale of emissions targets and commitments to tackle the ecological emergency. This first year’s scoring was intended to establish a baseline of councils’ plans and scale of ambition. Next year’s will assess to what extent local authorities are on track to reach net zero emissions. Although most local authorities have published climate plans, 38 district councils, three county councils, and 43 other councils in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have none. They include Norfolk county council, Gloucester city council and the London borough of Hackney. Annie Pickering, a campaigns and policy officer at Climate Emergency UK, said: “It’s been three years since the first councils declared climate emergencies and our scorecards show that many councils are still not making action on the climate and ecological emergency a priority. Councils can have a real influence on creating low-carbon communities, and with the warmest new year on record in the UK, we need to see action fast.” Somerset West and Taunton district council topped the league with a score of 91% (see below). Other high-scoring councils included West Midlands Combined Authority (89%), Staffordshire Moorlands (87%) and Solihull (85%). The average score across all UK local authorities was 46%. The analysis revealed significant regional variations, with the average score for Scottish authorities 50%, compared with 46% for England and 45% for Wales. Scotland scored particularly well on measuring and setting emissions targets. Scotland’s public bodies have been legally required since 2011 to reduce emissions and, since 2019, to report on progress. Edinburgh was the highest rated Scottish council, on 83%, and the joint fifth highest-scoring UK local authority. The city’s £1.3bn redevelopment of Granton Waterfront will create a 11 hectare coastal park to protect biodiversity, create up to 3,500 new net zero carbon homes, use lower-emitting offsite construction methods and improve public transport links. Edinburgh has allocated £2.8bn over 10 years to build 10,000 new sustainable and affordable homes by 2027, and to retrofit its 20,000 council houses to make them more energy efficient. And from 2025, all new school and early years buildings will be built to Passivhaus standard. The council has also upgraded all street lighting across the city to energy-efficient LED lights. In contrast, only four of Northern Ireland’s 11 councils had a climate action plan at all, with all four scoring 31% or lower. In Wales, just under a quarter of local authorities have no plan. The highest-scoring authority in Wales was Cardiff (70%), while in Northern Ireland it was Ards and North Down council (31%). “Some councils are clearly taking a strong lead on climate action, but others have much more to do,” said Cara Jenkinson, the cities manager at the sustainable energy charity Ashden. She said cutting emissions and nature restoration must be a priority for every council department “if they are to be carbon neutral by 2050, let alone 2030.” Nottingham is arguably the furthest ahead. The city has reduced its overall CO2 emissions per capita by 52.3% since 2005 and is on track to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has planted nearly 22,000 trees and installed more than 130 public electric vehicle charging points. Just under a third of council vehicles and nearly half of Hackney carriage taxis are ultra low emission vehicles, and the city has one of the UK’s largest fleets of electric buses. A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates about £8m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes. In 2014, Telford and Wrekin council became only the second local authority in the UK to build a publicly owned solar farm. To date it has saved more than 13,000 tonnes of CO2 emissionsand generated £1.3m for the council. Since 2020 the council has cut its carbon emissions by more than 57%. But English planning laws can make it harder to ensure that new developments are zero carbon or carbon neutral. From 2006, authorities were able to insist that houses were built to the highest energy standards, but this regulation was scrapped in 2015. The government’s new future homes standard aims to ensure new homes built from 2025 will produce 75-80% less carbon emissions than those built under current regulations. But councils’ energy efficiency plans remain subject to viability assessments from developers. If a developer can provide a sound viability assessment that proves a policy would make a scheme unaffordable, there is little local authorities can do to counter that. David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the Local Government Association’s environment and planning spokesperson, said: “Local government has a fundamental role to play in tackling climate change, but net zero can only be achieved if councils are empowered.” The LGA is calling for stronger powers and longterm funding to tackle the climate emergency. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome this research, which shows four in five councils are supporting our ambitions to deliver net zero by setting out climate action plans, with more expected to follow. Councils have an integral part to play and we will continue to work very closely with local partners to meet our climate change commitments.” How Somerset turned green Somerset West and Taunton was the only council to score above 90% and was one of only 21 to get top marks for its plans to improve biodiversity and combat the ecological emergency. It has declared its area a fracking-free zone, pledged to manage council services, buildings and land in a biodiversity-friendly manner, embed ecological initiatives alongside climate action in all work areas, and ensure that addressing both emergencies are strategic priorities for planning policies and design guides for new development. It has developed a climate-positive planning policy and is building zero-carbon council houses, as well as retrofitting existing housing stock. The council’s entire pool car fleet will be electric by the end of 2022. Dixie Darch, the executive member for climate change at Somerset West and Taunton council, said local authorities should lead by example. “We are committed to putting the climate emergency and environmental responsibility at the heart of what we do. The challenge has never been greater for local councils: it is essential we rise to that challenge,” she said. In addition to its own plan to make the district net zero by 2030, Somerset West has joined with the county council and three other district councils to create a climate emergency strategy for the whole county. This strategy includes developing wind and solar energy on councils’ land, improving public transport and electric vehicle use, and the creation of a nature partnership to improve biodiversity and restore nature. A campaign promoting recycling has led recycling rates to increase to more than 50%, among the highest in England. Meanwhile, at Somerset county council, the highest-scoring county, initiatives include a £1.5m climate emergency fund for community projects that help the county become more resilient to climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-11T08:15:10Z","webTitle":"Meet Mr Trash Wheel – and the other new devices that eat river plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","fields":{"headline":"Meet Mr Trash Wheel – and the other new devices that eat river plastic","bodyText":"The Great Bubble Barrier is just that – a wall of bubbles. It gurgles across the water in a diagonal screen, pushing plastic to one side while allowing fish and other wildlife to pass unharmed. The technology, created by a Dutch firm and already being used in Amsterdam, will be trialled in the Porto region of Portugalas part of the EU-supported Maelstrom (marine litter sustainable removal and management) project. It is the latest in a series of new technologies designed to find sustainable ways to remove and treat river debris before it reaches the sea. Plastic can be spread by natural disasters, such as a tsunami, which can push invasive species and debris halfway across the world. But rivers carry a much more regular supply of plastic to the oceans. Research in 2017 found that 10 river systems transport 90% of all the plastic that ends up in the world’s oceans (two in Africa – the Nile and Niger – with the other eight in Asia: the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Yangtze, Haihe, Pearl, Mekong and Amur). Molly Morse, a scientist at UC Santa Barbara’s Benioff Ocean Initiative and lead on its global Clean Currents Coalition, says: “In some cases, communities don’t have access to proper waste pickup services and must turn to what might seem to be the only alternative: dump the trash directly in the river to be carried away. “In other cases, plastic litter on land is moved by rain or wind into a river, where […] the plastic may make its way to the ocean.” An estimated 0.8m to 2.7m tonnes of plastic are carried by rivers to the ocean each year. That is the equivalent of 66,000 to 225,000 doubledecker buses. Without barriers, river currents carry plastic directly to the sea, where it becomes far trickier to tackle: plastic often floats for vast distances, can host invasive species and becomes part of the wider plastisphere, such as the concentration of seaborne waste in the Great Pacific garbage patch. That is why some scientists are calling for greater efforts to stop plastic going into rivers in the first place. A 2020 study found that a “significant reduction” of plastic in the ocean could be achieved only by stopping it reaching the sea, or through a combination of river barriers and other clean-up devices. Cue inventors, who have developed an array of river barriers and collection devices to catch and remove riverine plastic – from simple nets and booms to conveyor belts and robots. Mr Trash Wheel, known officially as the Inner Harbor Water Wheel, is a conveyor-belt system powered by currents and solar energy, launched in 2014 in the US city of Baltimore. Long booms with submerged skirts funnel waste into a central hub, where autonomous rakes scoop it on to a conveyor belt that deposits it on a barge, with more than 17 tonnes collected in a day. Once full, the barge takes the rubbish to be incinerated in a power plant, though it is hoped that eventually the collected waste can be sorted and recycled. There is now a whole family of Trash Wheels in Baltimore, the latest addition being Gwynnda, the Good Wheel of the West. Or there’s the Interceptor, a floating, solar-powered device developed by the non-profit organisation The Ocean Cleanup, billed as the “world’s first scalable solution” to rid the oceans of plastic. Similar but larger than the trash wheel, it has barriers that guide rubbish on to a conveyor belt, where a shuttle distributes it among five onboard waste bins. Another design, the Azure barrier, developed by the UK-based startup Ichthion to operate in any river, can remove up to 80 tonnes of plastic a day using durable, tide-sensitive booms that direct plastic to extraction points along the bank. The plastic is processed into flakes for recycling. Other more hi-tech inventions include the WasteShark, an electronically controlled “aquadrone” that preys on plastic – up to 350kg at a time. Using algorithms from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, the WasteShark moves around and back to its docking station autonomously, where up to five of the catamaran-shaped vessels can deposit the collected plastic and recharge. The design, developed by a Dutch startup, RanMarine, is due to be showcased at CES 2022 in Las Vegas this month. While the cost of implementing these technologies may be feasible for some cities and towns – and vastly preferable to the cost of plastic pollution, which it is estimated will reach $7.1tn (£5.25tn) by 2040 – there are many other factors to consider. These include, says Morse, “the physical river characteristics, amount of waste, seasonal changes, ecology, power sources, workforce availability, security, boat traffic [and] funding”. Philip Ehrhorn, co-founder of the Great Bubble Barrier, says: “One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of regulation regarding plastic pollution in our waterways and thereof the lack of ownership and responsibility for the problem. “The urgency to solve our plastic pollution problem in rivers is down to forward-thinking water authorities and governments, since plastic is not yet officially considered a water pollutant,” he says. Most of the world’s top 20 plastic-polluting rivers are in developing countries. But Ehrhorn adds: “Europe still has a huge issue with plastic pollution, which shouldn’t be ignored nor underestimated.” EU laws were introduced in January last year to tackle the “wild west” of plastic waste being dumped in poorer countries; the UK is one of Europe’s worst offenders, exporting about 70% of its plastic. But the wildest west lies across the Atlantic: the US is the world’s biggest plastic polluter, accounting for more than all EU countries combined. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, says Morse. “Rivers vary immensely in respect to factors such as depth, width, flow and seasonality. What might work in a massive river like the Mississippi in the United States, which flows all year round, likely will not work for a smaller, more seasonal river like the Tijuana in Mexico.” In Ecuador, Ichthion’s Azure prototype had problems on the Portoviejo River. Data had suggested the river’s depth varied in the wet and dry seasons by two metres; in reality, it fluctuated by as much as four metres within a few days. Getting support from the local people and permission for new infrastructure can also be difficult. For the Clean Currents Coalition, which is working with eight teams around the world, simplicity works best. “The most successful solutions have been the simpler technologies – such as booms, barriers and traps – that are manufactured locally and require manual removal of the captured waste,” Morse says. This can also create extra jobs. One example of these is Wildcoast’s “brute boom” at the Los Laureles Canyon, a tributary of the Tijuana River. The double-walled float stretches across the river and allows the boom to move with the changing depth. A suspended steel mesh catches the plastic, which is taken for processing once the boom is full. Reports from San Diego in California suggest that it has succeeded in reducing plastic downstream. TerraCycle’s river traps, which are installed in some of Bangkok’s 1,600 polluted canals, catch up to 2.5 tonnes of waste a day, helping to recycle plastic instead of sending it to landfill. A German startup, Plastic Fischer, has installed TrashBooms in waterways in Indonesia, India and Vietnam. It advocates a local, low-tech and low-cost approach, using locally manufactured mesh-and-float barriers to catch rubbish. Many environmentalists argue that these innovations treat the symptoms, not the problem, and that the only real solution is to curb plastic production. But, with plastic manufacturing shipments estimated to have risen by 2.2% last year by the Plastic Industry Association, this is not likely any time soon. “If we’re going to keep producing, consuming and disposing of plastics at, or near, our current rate, our ability to manage it needs to catch up – and quickly,” says Morse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/02/james-webb-space-telescope-thrilling-future-for-mankind","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-02T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Nasa’s Webb telescope is a joy.

But it’s the private ventures that push at limits","bodyText":"After years of delay, and massive cost over-runs, the James Webb space telescope (the JWST) was launched on Christmas Day. It will need to perform complex automated operations now it’s in space. The first and most challenging is happening this week: unfurling a heat shield the size of a tennis court. After this, its 6.5-metre mirror must be assembled from 18 pieces packed within the launching rocket’s nose-cone. There’s much that can go wrong and astronomers will remain anxious for the several months that will elapse before all necessary manoevres and tests are completed. After the Hubble Space Telescope was launched more than 30 years ago, its mirror turned out to be poorly aligned. But astronauts undertook a “rescue” mission to make adjustments and later made further visits to upgrade the instruments. The stakes are higher for the JWST: it’s vastly more elaborate, but there is no prospect of a repair mission. The Hubble telescope was in a low (and accessible) orbit: in contrast, the JWST’s orbit will be several times further away than the moon – far beyond the reach of astronauts. Some might argue that we therefore need to instigate more ambitious plans for human spaceflight: to enable human assembly of large structures in deep space, to return to the moon, and eventually to reach Mars. But I don’t share this view. Indeed as robotics and miniaturisation improve, the practical and scientific case for human spaceflight weakens. Its prime motive now is simply as an adventure – an ultra-expensive sport that should be left to billionaires and private sponsorship. Space technology has burgeoned – for communication, environmental monitoring, satnav and so forth. We depend on it every day. Unmanned probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. During this century, the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes, far more advanced than, for instance, Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. This was launched 20 years ago and based on 1990s technology. Think how much better we could do today. Robotic fabricators will assemble vast lightweight structures in space (huge, gossamer-thin mirrors or solar energy collectors, for instance), maybe using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. And they could repair spacecraft in orbit far beyond the moon. Robotic and AI techniques are evolving fast. For instance, the Curiosity vehicle sent to Mars a decade ago trundled slowly across a Martian crater; if it encountered a rock, it needed instructions from Earth about how to divert its path. In contrast, Perseverance, which landed on Mars last February, has sufficient intelligence to find its way around obstacles. In another decade, such a probe will have AI sufficient to identify and explore interesting sites and geological formations. Nasa’s programme for human spaceflight, ever since Apollo, has been impeded by public and political pressure into being exceedingly risk-averse. The space shuttle failed twice in 135 launches. Thrill-seekers would willingly accept this 2% level of risk. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as “safe”. So each failure caused a national trauma and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made (with very limited effect) to reduce the risk. Because of this safety culture, Nasa will confront political obstacles in achieving any grand goal within a feasible budget. But private enterprise ventures – SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest – bringing a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates, can cut costs and tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these ventures, with private funds and sponsorship, which should front manned missions. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle. These exploits must be sold as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. And here I disagree strongly with Elon Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from its problems. We’ve got to solve them here. Coping with climate change is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. There’s no “Planet B” for ordinary, risk-averse people. Nonetheless, this century courageous thrill-seekers may establish bases independent from the Earth. Musk himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. Although we may not want to join these space adventurers we should cheer them on. This is why. They’ll be ill-adapted to Martian conditions, so they’ll have a compelling incentive to redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed. These techniques will, one hopes, be restrained on Earth, on prudential and ethical grounds, but settlers on Mars will be beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them good luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. So it’s these spacefaring adventurers, not those of us comfortably adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era, evolving within a few centuries into a new species. (This evolution, proceeding on the timescale of technological advance, is potentially thousands of times faster than Darwinian selection.) Moreover, if they make the transition from flesh and blood to fully inorganic intelligences, they won’t need an atmosphere. And they may prefer zero-g, especially for constructing massive artifacts. So it’s in deep space – not on Earth, nor even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive 6bn more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer, perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy, via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA, instructions for 3D printers or suchlike. Interstellar voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. There’s plenty of time ahead.

Long-held assumptions can change dramatically in that time. Just ask the Business Council of Australia. In 2018, before the last federal election, the lobby group representing 100 of the country’s biggest businesses described a Labor pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 as “economy wrecking”. The Coalition’s more modest and less scientifically based goal of a 26-28% cut was deemed “appropriate and achievable”. (To its credit, the business council has chosen not to delete its incriminating tweet.) Three years of worsening science news and a once-in-a-century pandemic later, the BCA has turned on its heel. It believes Labor’s new, fractionally reduced 2030 target – a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels – and the policies that support it are a “sensible and workable plan”. Remarkably, given its history of opposing a national carbon price, it recently called on both major parties to do more. The BCA is not the only establishment heavyweight to have embraced greater ambition and offered support for Anthony Albanese and his climate change shadow minister, Chris Bowen, since the ALP emissions policy was released earlier this month. The Australian Industry Group – the country’s largest employer group – said Labor’s target could be delivered with “sensible policy reforms, greater collaboration and a close focus on industry competitiveness”. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it offered “a pathway to achieve the economic and technological transition towards a more sustainable future”. And the Australian Automobile Association said it was a “win for consumers”. This response is not a complete surprise. Most major corporates are persuaded the world will inevitably move on climate and that it is in their interests to do the same – or at least be seen to. But the support from business for Labor’s more ambitious stance reflects a sea change in the battle-weary world of Australian climate politics. Some observers have wondered if this is how the “climate wars” end, having helped bring down multiple political leaders on both sides and held back policy for more than a decade. Political disagreements and attacks will continue, but will the potency of a dishonest campaign over emissions policy have diminished by the time next year’s election rolls around? ‘There’s no going back’ Analysts mostly say: let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But they also say people should not underestimate what it means that the Coalition has promised the country will reach net zero emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison’s net zero plan, released shortly before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, includes no new policies, largely relies on unproven technology and does not actually get the country to net zero, but the long-delayed decision to set the target means for the first time Australia’s major political parties agree on the destination. It narrows the scope for political attack. “I think the war is over in the sense the fundamental differences about doing anything about climate change is over,” says Tony Wood, the energy program director with the Grattan Institute. “There is a rump of people on both sides who don’t want there to be bipartisan support for climate change and who see benefit in differentiation, but I think the question is whether we’re now entering a stage of cold wars and skirmishes.” Frank Jotzo, professor of climate change economics at the Australian National University Crawford School of Public Policy, says the centre of debate has shifted and bipartisan support for a net zero target opened “many, many opportunities and really changes the tone of the debate”. “There’s no going back on that,” he says. “Now that a conservative government that had a ‘no-action’ point of view supports a net zero target, there’s really no room for saying we shouldn’t be doing anything. “If you went just by what business says and what civil society says, then you would say there’s really nothing that could hold back a shift to effective and sensible climate policy in Australia. Large parts of the spectrum now agree on the fundamentals – they want ambitious targets and meaningful policies of some kind.” Of course, things are not that simple. “This agreement doesn’t necessarily translate into how elections are campaigned,” Jotzo says. “The preconditions for an end to the climate wars are there, but I think it’s too early to call.” Unanswered questions about the 2022 campaign include whether News Corp newspapers, which have run misleading campaigns against the cost of climate policies and attacked the scientific consensus, have moved on since launching a “mission zero” series on climate before the Glasgow summit or will return to their old ways. To date, the response has been more muted than some in Labor expected. There have been news stories describing the ALP policy as targeting big emitters – which is true, with the important caveat that it is gradual and has the support of business groups. Others have raised doubts about whether it would create more than 600,000 jobs and the extent to which it would lead to a reduction in energy bills – though it was not disputed that they would be cut. The most aggressive media attack was on the front page of News Corp’s Brisbane daily, the Courier Mail, which quoted backbencher Matthew Canavan creatively describing a plan to use an existing Coalition policy – the safeguard mechanism – to start to cut emissions from big industry as “Labor’s revenge” on Queensland. Morrison and his ministers have not gone as hard and the initial attack was quickly over, but it’s early days, and campaign lines have been tested. The prime minister claimed Labor’s policy would be bad for coal regions and manufacturing, and several MPs described the promised changes to the safeguard mechanism as a “sneaky new carbon tax”. In reality, Labor is proposing a more gentle use of the safeguard than promised by its architect, Liberal cabinet minister Greg Hunt, back in 2015. In response, Albanese said the Coalition was “frozen in time while the world warms around it” and that he expected the government to lie about Labor’s policy. Closing the climate policy gap Analysts expect Coalition criticism to be more targeted than in previous campaigns, reflecting not only the shared net zero target, but that the government is under pressure from climate-focused independents in heartland Sydney and Melbourne seats. A differentiated campaign – trying to convince inner-city residents the government is acting, while telling some parts of Queensland and New South Wales a Labor government would be devastating for them – is not impossible, but harder to land than in the past. Labor’s policy was designed with this in mind. There is a gap between the parties on 2030 targets, but it is relatively narrow once the government’s rhetoric is factored in. The prime minister still backs a target set under Tony Abbott six years ago, but claims official projections show the country would cut emissions by 35%. Whether you accept this or not – and there is reason not to – it leaves Labor promising just eight percentage points more than the Coalition. Albanese accurately described the ALP’s target as modest. The gap between the parties on renewable energy is similarly difficult to exploit. The government forecasts that 69% of electricity in the national market will be zero emissions by 2030, largely due to the tumbling cost of solar energy and incentives offered by state governments. Labor says it would lift that to 82% just by bringing forward construction of transmission lines to planned renewable energy zones. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director for the Australia Institute, says Labor has gone out of its way to avoid any area where it was at risk of being wedged by the government or other opponents. “It means the animosity and ridiculous scare campaigns about climate change that we’ve seen are unlikely to dominate this election,” he says. If this proves correct, it may leave the biggest battleground where those who believe the debate should be led by climate science say it should have always been – over what Australia has to do to live up to its global commitment to try to limit global heating to 1.5C. Politically, they include the Greens, who want a 75% cut by 2030 including a rapid phaseout of coal power, and some independent candidates.

But that hasn’t stopped council officials ordering Syd Reid, who lives in Wimbledon, remove his panels because his property is in a conservation area. A year ago he put up photovoltaic panels on his south-facing roof at the front of his home in an effort to reduce the property’s carbon footprint without realising he needed planning permission to do so. He had been assured, wrongly, by the installer that he didn’t. “I did a cursory investigation but somehow missed the conservation area rules,” he said. “The main reason I thought I would be fine was that our immediate neighbour has had almost identical south-facing solar panels on their roof for more than 10 years. “What’s happened since has been something out of the dark ages. Someone has complained and the council has ordered them to be taken down. It’s as if the climate crisis isn’t happening.” In 2008, the government removed the need for most people to get planning permission to install photovoltaic solar energy systems but the requirement for permission was retained in conservation areas and for all listed buildings. After Reid received an order from Merton’s planning department instructing him to take the panels down, he submitted an application for retrospective planning, only for this to be rejected. He said he appealed against that decision but this, too, has been turned down. He said the decision is all the more baffling given that the road that he lives on features a mixture of house styles and roof types. Not even the road’s greatest fan would describe it in any way as architecturally extraordinary, or important. “While the panels have been up I have reduced my carbon emissions by over 400kg,” he said. “The whole thing is madness – a combination of nimbyism and inconsistent, out-of-date planning bureaucracy that is failing to recognise the state [in which] we are leaving the planet. This has to be changed. “Our neighbour’s panels have been producing electricity for 10 years without upsetting anyone but mine have to come down. If I wish to maintain my level of carbon emissions reduction I have been advised that the only course of action left is to take my case to the high court.” A spokesperson for Merton council told Guardian Money that while installing solar panels is “generally to be applauded”, the council also has a duty to protect the “character” of the local area. “The standards of design that have to be met will always be higher in conservation areas,” he said. He said two other houses in the road have approved solar panels but on north-facing roofs, rather missing the point that they will produce significantly less power than they would on a south-facing roof. “We don’t want to put residents off installing carbon saving measures,” the spokesperson said. “Our planning officers are here to work with them to achieve developments that are compliant with our planning policy. There are other options which might have less of a visual impact, such as low-profile PVs or the use of solar tiles.” Meanwhile, it now looks likely that Reid’s neighbour could be forced to remove their panels, too. “We have not looked into this yet as no formal complaint was raised. However, our officers will now look to inspect and regularise those solar panels,” the Merton spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-11T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: for solar panels, some like it not too hot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: for solar panels, some like it not too hot","bodyText":"When my mother installed solar photovoltaic panels on her roof in the Scottish borders, I was sceptical that they would produce much energy. But in the decade or so she has had them they have easily paid their way. Now research in the journal Weather confirms what my mother already knows: it’s not just hot countries that can harvest solar energy. We are going to need solar energy to reach net zero, so it is important we find the best places to situate solar farms. Cloudy locations are pretty hopeless, for obvious reasons, but places that tend to be cold, sunny and breezy (like much of the UK and Ireland) are surprisingly good. Cool temperatures and a gentle wind help to prevent the panels from overheating, optimising efficiency. “Even though these locations are not known for their sunny climate, long daylight hours during summer can still generate large amounts of solar energy,” write Eadaoin Doddy Clarke and Conor Sweeney, of University College Dublin. So where should we put these solar farms? Previous research has shown that cropland and grassland areas tend to have the greatest potential for solar energy; after all, that is why the plants grow so well there. But that doesn’t mean we have to lose farmland: experiments have shown that crops can be grown successfully underneath solar panels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-09T01:04:31Z","webTitle":"As the Coalition and Labor pretend Australia’s ageing coal plants have a future, the figures don’t add up | Temperature check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","fields":{"headline":"Coalition and Labor claim Australia’s ageing coal plants won’t close early, but the figures don’t add up","bodyText":"Just how much coal-fired power will Australia have left running in 2030? It has become a sensitive question for the country’s major political parties ahead of next year’s election. Both parties have recently released data that suggests under their leadership the country’s shift towards a clean electricity grid would accelerate dramatically over the next nine years. But both claim there will not be an accelerated closure of Australia’s ageing coal plants that currently provide the bulk of the power. It is an implausible argument given the scale of the shift under way. Over the past year about 31% of electricity in the national electricity market (covering the five eastern states and the ACT) has come from renewable energy. The proportion has doubled in just four years, but coal still dominates, providing 63% of electricity. Gas-fired power contributes 6%. The Morrison government has not touted the figure, but official federal data suggests the proportion of renewable energy will hit 69% by 2030 if we continue on our current course. Anthony Albanese says a Labor government would build on this by introducing a $20bn “re-wiring the nation” policy to connect solar and wind farms and batteries in renewable energy zones to the grid sooner than planned. Modelling of the ALP plan by the research firm RepuTex suggests that by 2030 the grid would run on 82% renewable electricity, leaving less than 20% coming from coal and gas combined. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the Coalition expects a 55% cut from electricity generation by 2030 compared with 2005 levels on the current path. Labor’s modelling implies a 74% cut from electricity over the same timeframe under its plan. But in both cases the emissions reduction from the electricity sector is much bigger than that planned across the economy. Labor has set a 43% target – a notable improvement, but still less than what scientists say is necessary for Australia to play its part in living up to the Glasgow climate pact – while the Coalition has not increased the 26%-28% goal it set under Tony Abbott more than six years ago. Chris Bowen, Labor’s climate change and energy shadow minister, has been emphatic that the ALP plan would not lead to coal-fired power plants shutting earlier than scheduled. How does this add up? It’s not entirely clear. The Australian Energy Market Operator lists 23GW of coal-fired capacity currently connected to the national market. Just four plants – Liddell and Vales Point in New South Wales, Yallourn in Victoria and Callide B in Queensland – are scheduled to close before 2030. They would cut the total coal capacity of the grid by about 24% compared with today. But we know that other coal-fired plants are under financial strain. There is now so much cheap solar energy in the middle of the day that coal is barely needed at times. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, earlier this year said coal companies were “going broke” and plants were likely to shut four or five years earlier than expected. Officials in the federal energy department appear to agree. The official projections suggest the country (including Western Australia, which has its own grid) will have 14GW of coal capacity in 2030 under the Coalition – about a further 5GW reduction on what is formally scheduled to close by then. A new analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a clean-energy focused thinktank, expresses this another way – it says there will be a more than 40% cut in coal power capacity between now and 2030 under the Coalition, based on its own documents. It assumes Labor’s policy would lead to further closures. The ALP rejects this. Bowen’s argument is that Australia will need more electricity by 2030 as the country “electrifies everything” – industry starts to switch away from using fossil fuels as a direct feedstock to running on renewable power and there is a greater uptake of electric vehicles. This is true. But the modelling released by Labor leaves out some details – for example, how much electricity use is expected to increase between now and 2030, and how often the coal-fired plants left connected to the grid would actually be operating. Johanna Bowyer, a lead research analyst with IEEFA, says even with a rise in demand for electricity it “doesn’t add up” to suggest there will not be more early coal closures. “If you’re at 82% renewables there is not much left for fossil fuel generators to actually generate,” she says. “The only way they could be online is if they were generating some other payment that essentially subsidises them to sit there.” That subsidy could come in the form of a “capacity mechanism” that both the Coalition and Labor have backed to ensure there is the necessary support in the system that can be called on when needed to back up variable solar and wind. The Coalition says the mechanism would be “technology neutral” and not focused on coal, specifically; Labor says it should encourage investment in renewable energy and was a bridge to clean “dispatchable” technologies such as pumped hydro, hydrogen and batteries. But that does not rule out both parties paying coal companies to keep a fleet of generators alive as backup, even if they are rarely, if ever, used. Experts say it is hard to see what else would keep so much coal in the system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It would not necessarily lead to higher emissions – coal turbines do not emit when not turned on – but both sides of politics could expect questions about whether paying coal bosses to keep their plants idle is the best use of taxpayers’ money. There are other important questions. When will MPs of all colours level with voters in coal communities that the economics of clean energy and the need to address the climate crisis will inevitably mean coal plants shutting, or effectively shutting, earlier than planned? And what will they do to help give them a future in a post-coal world? Ridd reports on reef ‘selective’ Peter Ridd, the former James Cook University professor who was sacked for breaches of the university’s code of conduct relating to public commentary that the university said denigrated a colleague, has continued his criticism of scientists and government agencies working on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. Ridd was given space in The Australian last Friday to argue an annual reef long-term monitoring survey by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) had found “spectacularly good results”, and that across the reef’s three regions there had “never been more coral since records began in the mid-1980s”. He accused Aims and others of ignoring this data, hoping nobody would notice and contriving a “spurious but apparently plausible reason that the good news is actually bad news” for the reef. Aims has responded, saying Ridd has been “very selective” in quoting from its report. A spokesperson for the institute agreed with Ridd on one point – that the latest results showed the reef could recover during periods when it was not disturbed by mass bleaching, cyclones or other disturbances, and that this was good news. But they said this had not yet lifted coral cover to record levels, and that Ridd consistently ignored a key point – that the scale, intensity and frequency of bleaching events had increased over the past decade, giving it less time to recover. Ridd emphasised that fragile, fast-growing corals had driven a recent increase in overall hard coral cover, but the spokesperson said he ignored that all types of corals were affected by the unprecedented three mass bleaching events in 2016, 2017 and 2020, and the time between major disturbances was now too short for other coral types to recover. They said Ridd continued to incorrectly reject the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate crisis was the biggest threat to the reef, that oceans were warming and the reef would be increasingly susceptible to bleaching due to rising temperatures. On this, the report was clear, saying: “Periods of low disturbance, such as that seen in 2021, are becoming shorter, reducing the time for recovery. The recovery to date will be easily undone by the next severe tropical cyclone or widespread bleaching event.” The Aims spokesperson said there was an inherent contradiction in Ridd’s argument – he suggested both that Aims’ survey was proof of a permanent recovery in coral cover and that its data could not be trusted. “Unfortunately, he can’t have it both ways,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-05T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"From pollutant to product: the companies making stuff from CO2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","fields":{"headline":"From pollutant to product: the companies making stuff from CO2","bodyText":"In a warehouse laboratory in Berkeley, California, Nicholas Flanders stands in front of a shiny metal box about the size of a washing machine. Inside is a stack of metal plates that resemble a club sandwich – only the filling is a black polymer membrane coated with proprietary metal catalyst. “We call the membrane the black leaf,” he says. Flanders is the co-founder and CEO of Twelve, a startup founded in 2015, which received a $57m funding boost in July. It aims to take air – or, to be more precise, the carbon dioxide (CO2) in it – and transform it into something useful, as plants also do, eliminating damaging emissions in the process. Taking the unwanted gas wreaking havoc on our climate and using only water and renewable electricity, Twelve’s metal box houses a new kind of electrolyser that transforms the CO2 into synthesis gas (syngas), a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be made into a range of familiar products usually made from fossil fuels. Oxygen is the only by-product. This August, the pilot scale equipment made the syngas that went into what Flanders claims is the world’s first carbon neutral, fossil-free jet fuel produced by electrolysing CO2. “This is a new way of moving carbon through our economy without pulling it out of the ground,” he says. Twelve is one of many companies beginning to make stuff out of CO2, captured either from industrial emissions or directly from the air. High-end goods such as vodka, diamonds and activewear, industrial materials such as concrete, plastic, foam and carbon fibre, and even food, are all beginning to be created using CO2. In addition to jet fuel, which is a partnership with the US air force, Twelve has been using its syngas to explore making parts of car interiors with Mercedes-Benz, laundry detergent ingredients with Tide and sunglasses lenses with Pangaia. Online marketplaces such as Expedition Air and SkyBaron are even springing up to sell consumer goods made with CO2 emissions. “We are at the very early end of a new carbon tech industry,” says Pat Sapinsley, of the Urban Future Lab at New York University, who oversees a new accelerator programme to help fledgling startups get a foothold. While the industry is still only emerging – most activity is only at bench or pilot scale – it is estimated by the Lab there are now about 350 startups hoping to deliver so-called carbon-to-value. Venture capital investment has sharply risen. This year, over $550m had flowed in by the end of September according to research and consulting firm Cleantech Group; that’s more than in the previous five years put together. The sector could have the potential to reduce the world’s CO2 emissions by more than 10%, according to analysis by the University of Michigan’s Global CO2 Initiative, which aims to help the sector emerge (fuels and building materials such as concrete and aggregates are considered to hold the biggest CO2 mitigation – and market – potential). That contribution, advocates argue, firmly makes carbon utilisation part of the suite of technologies we are going to need to reach the net zero commitments governments and corporations have been making and which, it is becoming clear, can’t be met by renewable electricity alone. “I don’t see a path to net zero without these kinds of technologies,” says Richard Youngman, CEO of Cleantech Group. Premium running shoe brand On – which went public this September – realised that if it was going to reach its aggressive net zero targets it would need to rethink its materials. Its vision is now that half of all its shoe bottom foam will be made not from petrochemicals but captured carbon. Last month, it announced plans to team up with US-based startup LanzaTech – an early pioneer of the sector, which uses a patented fermentation process to make ethanol out of waste carbon monoxide collected from factories which would otherwise be burnt to emit CO2 – and chemical manufacturer Borealis, which makes the foam by polymerising ethylene (to which ethanol can be converted). On is hoping to unveil its first pair of shoes made wholly from captured carbon sometime next year (it has separate arrangements to make the shoe uppers). That first pair will cost about $1m to make, says Caspar Coppetti, On’s co-founder and executive co-chairman. It’s a lab endeavour to prove viability – but, eventually, when it scales, he doesn’t expect the shoes to cost much more than a regular pair. It’s not that CO2 isn’t already used industrially (think carbonated beverages). But those uses either put the gas unchanged back into the atmosphere or, in the case of enhanced oil recovery, where injected CO2 pushes out oil and then remains underground, still perpetuates the extraction of new fossil fuels. What’s different here is that waste CO2 is chemically transformed to make new products. Some, such as building materials, eliminate emissions by locking the carbon away permanently; others, such as jet fuel, prevent new emissions by recycling already emitted carbon. Often grouped with utilisation is CO2 sequestration, which promises to store large amounts of captured CO2 permanently underground, but the two are quite different, as advocates point out. “It’s almost a sin to throw away a valuable resource,” says Volker Sick, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan who directs the Global CO2 Initiative. “The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things.” New York-based startup Air Company, launched in 2017, is selling CO2-made vodka and perfume, and produced hand sanitiser during the pandemic. Like Twelve, it starts with CO2, water and renewable energy but combines them in its reactor to make alcohols such as ethanol. A litre of vodka removes a pound of CO2, and it may soon even use CO2 captured from the heating systems of Manhattan office buildings (in a collaboration with capture startup CarbonQuest). But, like Twelve, Air Company has jet fuel in its sights – which can also be produced from ethanol. It is a crowded field – others pressing ahead with CO2-made jet fuel include LanzaJet, a spinoff from ethanol maker LanzaTech, and SynHelion, which uses solar energy to transform CO2 to syngas. Typically, it is small amounts – think litres per hour – of jet fuel being made at this stage, says Ian Hayton, a materials and chemicals analyst at Cleantech Group. But countries are beginning to introduce quotas for sustainable aviation fuels, which could move things forwards. And the advantage of making it from CO2, rather than biomass or waste vegetable oils, is that it uses far less land. Canadian company CarbonCure, founded in 2012, is one of the pioneers on the building materials side. Backed by investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Bill Gates’s investment firm, its technology involves injecting CO2 into concrete as it is being mixed. The injected CO2 reacts with the wet concrete and rapidly becomes permanently stored as a mineral, the same one as in limestone. CarbonCure’s business model is to license its technology to concrete manufacturers themselves. CarbonCure retrofits their systems, transforming them into carbon tech companies (the CO2 is supplied by waste emission sources in their region). It gives them a green sales advantage, but really what the concrete producers like is the economic benefit, says co-founder and CEO Robert Niven. It means less cement is needed to make the concrete – most are able to reduce their cement content by about 5% – and the addition of the CO2 also strengthens the final material. It is hard to imagine that food in the form of protein could be mass produced from CO2, but that is exactly what another subset of carbon tech companies are working on. Some, such as Solar Foods in Finland, and Air Protein in California – which uses the tagline “meat made from air” – intend their products for human consumption, while others, such as UK- and Netherlands-based Deep Branch, are focusing on animal feed ingredients. With inputs typically of CO2, water and renewable electricity along with ammonia and nutrients, their proteins are produced in bioreactors from naturally occurring microbes. The microbes grow and multiply and are then dried out to produce a protein powder with all the essential amino acids. “It is somewhere between dried meat, dried soy and dried carrot,” says Pasi Vainikka, Solar Foods co-founder and CEO, of its product Solein. Admittedly, that doesn’t sound very appetising, but, says Vainikka, the taste comes in the final product and Solein is versatile. It could replace pea and soy protein isolate in processed foods or even be used as a feed for the cultivated meat industry. Treated with heat and pressure, it can be eaten like a tasty slab of steak or tofu. Two kilograms of CO2 makes a kilogram of the product and it has been submitted to food regulators in Europe and the UK for novel food approval. Yet the field also faces many challenges to come to fruition. First, if the technology is really going to serve the climate, it has to be scaled up for mass production quickly and offer price-competitive products. “There’s no point unless we can deliver on scale,” says Allison Dring, CEO of German startup Made of Air, which is focusing on plastics replacements. Many of the companies have plans for their first commercial facilities – Twelve, for example, which has designed its equipment to be modular so it can easily be added to increase capacity, a bit like a solar farm, hopes to have its first shipping container-sized plant by next year and predicts significant commercial volume by 2023. But scaling up is capital intensive and takes time. One specific roadblock is finding customers. The startups need bigger companies to pair up with to buy their CO2-made raw materials, but it can be hard for them to break into established supply chains. A big focus of the startup accelerator programme run out of the Urban Futures Lab, called the C2V Initiative, is on making inter-industry connections but, really, more early movers like On are needed. CarbonCure is proud of the fact that 450 concrete plants have been retrofitted with its technology – accounting for virtually all the carbon utilisation project deployments to date, says Niven – but it is only a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 concrete plants there are worldwide. “Right now, what we need is partners,” he says. Another bottleneck to scale may be providing the large and low-cost quantities of CO2 needed. While technologies are certainly established to capture CO2 from industrial sources, it is only done on a minuscule scale at present, experts note. Direct air capture is less technologically developed and more expensive. And infrastructure will be needed to move the CO2 if, for example, it is being captured in a different place from where it is being used. Massive government intervention and support are required for rapid growth, say advocates – be that by setting a carbon price, through procurement policies in government contracts that require CO2-based alternatives, or by infrastructure investment. “This needs to be exponential growth… and we need policies to support it,” says Peter Styring, an expert in carbon capture and utilisation at the University of Sheffield, who directs its Centre for Carbon Dioxide Utilisation. And while recent US efforts are welcomed – the US infrastructure bill, for example, includes over $8bn for direct air capture and CO2 transportation and storage – “there is space for governments to be braver,” says Cleantech’s Youngman. More detailed guidelines for carbon accounting might also be needed to aid consumer acceptance. Life cycle analyses for the products need to take the whole of the supply chain into account, but companies can set the boundaries in a way that excludes some processes. “We studied concrete production and, in some cases, it actually was worse than just making regular concrete,” says Sick. Both he and Styring are working on improving how companies might perform their assessments as part of an international effort. And just how controversial carbon utilisation will be remains an open question. Not everyone is gung-ho. Innovation has a role to play in curbing climate change, says Mike Childs, head of policy at the environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth, but such “wonder technologies” are “unproven” to work at the massive scale envisaged and are therefore a “huge gamble” with both people’s lives and the planet. “We know that driving down emissions at source is the best and cheapest way to limit global heating,” he says, adding that the technology also risks providing political and business leaders with justification to keep burning fossil fuels. The transition away from fossil fuels is a must, say the advocates of CO2 utilisation. But if we want modern life to go on as normal without sacrifices, we’ll need to find new ways of continuing to produce the goods fossil fuels have given us. This industry, they argue, will not only help mitigate climate change but provide the carbon-based products we will always need. “There’s a lot of ‘climate don’ts’,” says Flanders. “[But] you can actually continue to use products that you like, just made in a better way.” • This article was amended on 5 December 2021.

Hailed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a key plank in his green industrial revolution, the grants only upgraded about 47,500 homes out of the 600,000 originally planned. They also delivered a small fraction of the expected jobs. The grants were intended to support the public in England to make their homes more energy efficient and move away from fossil fuel heating by installing heat pumps and solar energy. But the PAC said the scheme unveiled in 2020 by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), was poorly designed and had a troubled implementation. The Guardian previously revealed the grants were administered by ICF, an American corporation based in Fairfax, Virginia. Renewable energy businesses said the administration of the grants was chaotic, inefficient, confused and created long delays for the public and those installing the systems. MPs on the public accounts committee said more than £1,000 per home upgraded was spent on administration; a total of £50m or 16% of the total spend of £314m. This was a fraction of the £1.5bn budget promised to upgrade 600,000 homes. The scheme began operation in September 2020 and was scrapped abruptly in March this year after just six months operating. Cutting carbon emissions from homes – which emit 20% of the UK’s CO2 – is seen as crucial if the country is to reach net zero by 2050. Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “It cost the taxpayer £50m just to administer the pointlessly rushed through Green Homes Grant scheme, which delivered a small fraction of its objectives, either in environmental benefits or the promised new jobs. “We heard it can take 48 months – four years – to train the specialists required to implement key parts of a scheme that was dreamed up to be rolled out in 12 weeks. It was never going to work at this time, in this way, and that should have been blindingly obvious to the department. That it was not is a serious worry, I am afraid there is no escaping the conclusion that this scheme was a slam dunk fail.” The MPs said they were not convinced that BEIS had fully acknowledged the scale of its failures with this scheme. Hillier said it was vital to have a massive step-change in the way homes and public buildings are heated. “But the way this was devised and run was just a terrible waste of money and opportunity at a time when we can least afford it.” The report said the failure of the scheme had damaged confidence in government efforts to improve energy efficiency in private domestic homes. The way government was tackling the issue of domestic heating was “fragmented, stop-go activity” which had hindered stable long-term progress towards its energy efficiency ambitions. The government awarded the administration of the grants to ICF, who had promised to deliver it in six weeks – other companies said fully implementing such a system would take at least 15 weeks – but ICF was not challenged by the department to explain how it could deliver, the report found. In the end, the department launched the complex scheme without an IT platform that had been fully developed and tested to run it. ICF struggled to implement the digital voucher application system, leading to greater amounts of manual processing being needed for applications, contributing to the delays in processing vouchers.

Initially, the Home Office rejected the asylum claim lodged by Dr Nadarajah Muhunthan, 47, who has been living in the UK since 2018 with his wife, Sharmila, 42, and their three children, aged 13, nine and five. Muhunthan, who is working on thin-film photovoltaic devices used to generate solar energy, was given a prestigious Commonwealth Rutherford fellowship. The award allowed him to come to the UK for two years to research and develop the technology. He was based at the University of Bristol. His wife got a job caring for elderly people in a nursing home. The couple’s eldest daughter, Gihaniya, has received outstanding school reports in the UK with a 100% attendance rate and been particularly praised for her achievements in science. She hopes to study to be a doctor when she is older. The family are Tamils, a group that has experienced persecution in Sri Lanka. However, just weeks after the Guardian highlighted the case, the Home Office changed its mind and has now granted Muhunthan and his family refugee status. Muhunthan thanked the Home Office for their decision. “The Home Office has saved my life and my family’s lives. Now I will be able to continue my research without fear,” he said. After reading the previous Guardian article about the case, Prof David J Firmin, head of the electro-chemistry and solar team at the University of Bristol where Muhunthan was conducting research into ways to make solar energy panels more effective and affordable, wrote to the Home Office at the end of October expressing his “deepest concern”. He said Muhunthan’s work was making a significant contribution to efforts to decarbonise the energy generation sector. In November 2019, Muhunthan returned to his home country for a short visit to see his sick mother. While he was there, he was arrested and persecuted by the Sri Lankan government. He managed to escape and returned to the UK, where he claimed asylum on the basis of what he had experienced on his visit to Sri Lanka. After his scholarship expired in February 2020, neither he nor his wife were permitted to continue working. The family’s lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC solicitors, welcomed the Home Office’s change of heart. He said:“This is an important victory which recognises there is systematic torture of Tamils going on in Sri Lanka. This scientist and his family will all be assets to the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-22T11:00:24Z","webTitle":"How the chemicals industry’s pollution slipped under the radar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","fields":{"headline":"How the chemicals industry’s pollution slipped under the radar","bodyText":"It’s one of the biggest industries in the world, consumes more than 10% of fossil fuels produced globally and emits an estimated 3.3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions a year, more than India’s annual emissions – yet the chemicals sector has largely slipped under the radar when it comes to climate. This sprawling industry produces a huge range of products, many of which support other industries – pesticides for agriculture, acids for mining, lubricants for machinery, ingredients in cleaning agents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and plastics. While the industry has an important role to play in moving to low-carbon economies – providing coatings for solar panels, lightweight plastics to reduce vehicles’ energy consumption and insulating materials for buildings – it’s also hugely carbon intensive and predicted to become more so. Oil companies have been betting on chemicals as a way to remain profitable as the world pledges to turn away from fossil fuel energy. The International Energy Agency predicted that petrochemicals could account for 60% of oil demand in the next decade. The chemicals sector is the largest industrial user of oil and gas but it has the third-largest carbon footprint – behind steel and cement – because only about half of the fossil fuels that the industry consumes are burned for their energy. The rest is used as feedstock for products such as plastics with the emissions released only when these products reach the end of their lives, for example, when waste plastic packaging or an old mattress is incinerated. Lowering the industry’s emissions is possible but technically daunting. Plus this large, complex industry, which supports millions of jobs worldwide, has significant political and economic clout. “They’ve become a bit of an untouchable sector for many politicians,” said Jan-Justus Andreas, who leads industrial policy at the Norwegian environmental non-profit Bellona Europa. Yet the chemicals industry is finding itself increasingly under scrutiny – both from nations that need to meet ambitious emissions reduction targets and from researchers, scientists and campaigners calling on the industry to cut its polluting products. Moving away from dirty energy One way to lower emissions is to focus on chemical plants – improving efficiency and switching to low-carbon energy. Most of the industry’s direct carbon dioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels to power chemical transformations, many of which take place at high temperatures and pressures. These emissions could be significantly reduced if the industry moves away from dirtier fuels such as coal. If renewable wind or solar energy is available, certain chemical processes that are already driven by electricity, such as the production of chlorine used to make other materials such as PVC pipes or solvents like chloroform, could immediately become low carbon. And chemists continue to look for ways to power traditionally heat-driven chemical transformations with electricity instead – such as the process of converting nitrogen to ammonia, mostly used for fertilizer, which requires temperatures of about 500C (932F). While chemical companies are counting on efficiency improvements and investing in renewable energy to meet their climate goals, many chemical products themselves cannot be decarbonized because they are made of carbon, said Martin Scheringer, an environmental chemist at the public research university ETH Zurich. Removing fossil fuels from the raw materials used to create carbon-based chemicals and materials is crucial, said Jonatan Kleimark of the non-profit ChemSec. Kleimark likens products made from fossil fuels – such as clothes, toys and paints – to a carbon debt, because the carbon embedded within them will only be emitted in the future. “The longer we wait to change, the larger debt we will build, and that will be very hard to do something about if we don’t start,” Kleimark said. To stop adding to this debt, chemicals and materials could be made with sources of carbon that are already above ground, such as plants. Bioplastics – made with plant materials such as sugar, corn or seaweed – are booming, for example, as companies and scientists try to remove fossil fuels from plastic production. Another idea is to turn waste products into raw materials for the chemical industry. Chemists have been using agricultural waste or waste plastics – even the ultimate waste material, carbon dioxide – as feedstocks. A Berlin-based startup, Made of Air, is attempting to create plastics from wood waste, while an Icelandic company, Carbon Recycling International, turns captured carbon dioxide emissions into methanol, used in fuels and for making other chemicals such as formaldehyde. ‘Why don’t you deal with someone else first?’ But all these ideas – especially those involving a shift in feedstocks – are very hard to implement. Technologies to turn agricultural or plastic waste into new chemicals are still unproven on a large scale and using carbon dioxide as a raw material will require vast amounts of zero-carbon energy. Manufacturers making products with plants rather than fossil fuels need to ensure that they do not create new problems through deforestation, destroying wildlife habitat, raising food prices or increasing the use of water or pesticides. Biomass resources also tend to be more spread out, whereas traditionally, chemical plants stay close to where fossil fuel resources are easily accessible. “With renewable feedstocks, you will need to reestablish new supply chains,” said Zhanyun Wang, a senior scientists at ETH Zurich. In addition to delivering a steady stream of renewable raw materials to chemical plants, the new supply chains would need to be competitive with well-established ones making products from fossil fuels at low prices, Wang said. The clean power infrastructure requirements alone are tremendous. Electrifying Europe’s chemicals sector would require 4,900 terawatts of renewable electricity, according to an estimate by the European Chemical Industry Council, almost double the total amount of electricity Europe generated in 2019. “If you are a lobbyist for the chemical sector, showing those numbers helps you to put your head down again and say, ‘Look, firstly I’m too important and valuable, and secondly, it’s really, really difficult to deal with me, so why don’t you deal with someone else first,’” Andreas said. Currently, that someone else refers to the cement and steel industries, said Andreas. The internal competition between the three industries to avoid scrutiny is unhelpful, he said, because they could benefit from developing an industrial strategy together. The exhaust gases from steel and cement plants could serve as valuable feedstocks for chemical plants. All three industries need large-scale renewable electricity or carbon capture facilities, which require significant investment. The financial risks involved in building these new facilities could be mitigated, Andreas said, if the new facilities serve multiple operations instead of a single steel mill or fertilizer plant. Governments could also help build the necessary infrastructure or help companies gain access to renewable feedstocks, said Rebecca Dell, who directs the industry program at the San Francisco-based ClimateWorks Foundation. But with less than 30 years to 2050, time is short. If there are no delays, typically, it takes about seven years for companies to get a new process up and running, Dell said. “We have to move a lot faster.” Simplifying products One important, but neglected, lever for cutting emissions from the chemical sector is to simply use and produce fewer chemicals. “That would lead very directly to a reduction in CO2 emissions and also reduce the toxification of humans and the environment,” Scheringer said. The overuse of materials such as plastics, fertilizers and other synthetic chemicals has caused devastating effects on ecosystems and human health. Plastic debris chokes waterways and wildlife, fertilizer-laden runoff from fields can cause algal blooms and create dead zones in coastal areas. These impacts have led policymakers and consumers to cut back – for instance, many cities and countries now have prohibitions on some single-use plastics. “It’s an attempt to reduce plastic itself as a pollutant in the landscape, more than concerns about greenhouse gases, but we can make simultaneous progress on more than one front,” said Dell. Studies have also found that being more precise about applying fertilizer could save farmers money and keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. It is less straightforward to cut back on some of the chemicals that are used to make consumer products, but Scheringer, Wang and others have proposed a way to start. Alarmed by the dangers of some cancer-causing PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”, researchers have suggested eliminating PFAS from their “nice-to-have” applications – such as nonstick cookware, long-lasting mascara, or water-repellent surfer shorts that don’t need the level of high performance that “forever chemicals” confer. The researchers recommend that “forever chemicals” be used only in really important products, such as protective gear or medical devices that save lives. The same philosophy could be applied to identify and eliminate other chemicals that have been unnecessarily formulated in products, such as adding antimicrobials to soaps that can already kill germs. Simplifying the chemical ingredients in products has an added benefit: they are easier to take apart or recycle when they are no longer useful. Wang points to the example of carbon black, the chemical used as a pigment in food takeout boxes. The pigment serves no technical function other than providing colour and it is used because food looks more appealing set against a black background, Wang said. But the pigment also means the takeout boxes are invisible to devices that use light to sort plastics at sorting facilities, making them impossible to recycle. The chemical sector is producing more than consumers need, Wang said: “The business model is driven by how many chemicals you sell, it’s not necessarily driven by the added societal value of the chemical.” But the “enormous demand” for products is also a big driver – and perhaps harder to address, said Kleimark. “We’re standing in front of a really, really big challenge because there we cannot rely on technologies, but on changing the way we do things today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-20T19:00:35Z","webTitle":"Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","fields":{"headline":"Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?","bodyText":"The New South Wales government announced this week it would move to ban dark roofs as part of environmental planning rules to help the state achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said on Wednesday that ditching dark roofing “would have an enormous impact on the urban heat island effect”, citing University of NSW research suggesting ambient temperatures in Sydney could drop by up to 2.4C as a result. The announcement has been welcomed by experts. Prof Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at UNSW, said: “The recognition that this is a useful strategy for minimising vulnerability to climate change is terrific.” What are the effects of roofing on housing and city temperature? What is the urban heat island effect? “The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon that affects a lot of big cities around the world,” says Dr Gloria Pignatta of the UNSW’s City Futures Research Centre. The effect refers to urban centres being significantly warmer than rural areas – estimates vary between 1C and 13C on average. It occurs as a result of land modification; built-up areas have less green cover and more hard surfaces which absorb and radiate heat. The difference in temperature between cities and rural areas is often greater at night, and previous research has suggested the density and colour of building materials are significant contributors. Pitman says the effect doesn’t occur all year round, but depends on weather patterns. What colour of roof is best if you want a cooler house? In western Sydney, a light-coloured roof could reduce temperatures inside the home by 4C on average and up to 10C during a heatwave compared with darker roofing, according to research commissioned by the federal government. Materials that are able to reflect a high portion of incoming solar energy, rather than absorbing it, make for cooler roofs. This reflectance is a property known as albedo. Generally speaking, dark-coloured surfaces have a lower albedo, absorbing more solar radiation than brighter surfaces. “Every colour has a different behaviour in terms of reflection of light,” Pignatta says. Lighter shades within the same colour are preferable. “It is not coincidental that a lot of Mediterranean countries have white roofs,” Pitman says. But cooler roofing isn’t just a matter of black and white. “It doesn’t so much matter what the colour is – it matters what the reflectivity is,” Pitman says. There are “cool” roofing materials that don’t look visibly different from traditional options but result in significantly lower temperatures as a result of specific components incorporated into their surfaces. Pignatta cites terracotta tiles as an example. “You can have natural red clay tiles and ‘cool’ red clay tiles”, which appear to be the same hue. “Natural red clay tiles, for example, can reach up to 60 to 70C on a clear sunny day,” she says. The second option results in a temperature 10C or more cooler. “They don’t work in the visible spectrum … but they are able to reflect solar radiation in the infrared spectrum.” Cooler options exist for surfaces of most colours, Pignatta says, adding it is also useful for asphalt on roads, given the visual impracticality of driving on reflective white streets. Whether an area is built up is also a factor to consider. “If you have a mix of high-rise buildings and low-rise buildings and you have cool roofs on the low rises, you can create an impact on the buildings that are close to them because of the solar reflection,” Pignatta says. Does roofing material matter? When it comes to cooling, it’s not only how well the material reflects sunlight that matters, but also how well it radiates heat – a property known as thermal emissivity. “In summer, what you’re looking for is a surface that doesn’t absorb sunlight but radiates heat really well,” Pitman says. Metals have a low thermal emissivity, and hence do not readily release any heat they have absorbed. “They are not good materials to be used in the urban environment, especially if you consider large surfaces … even if they are white,” Pignatta says. Other materials such as clay tile, gravel or membrane roofing are preferable because they all have “generally quite high thermal emissivity”, she says. Green roofs are also an option to consider if light-coloured vegetation is chosen, as such plants have a higher albedo, Pignatta says. They can have an evaporative cooling effect if well watered, Pitman says. “Green roofs need to be sufficiently moist to cool themselves,” he says, warning this can be difficult to achieve during drought and extreme heat events. What effects do cool roofs have in winter? In the winter, solar energy absorbed by a roof can add warmth to a building. In some locations, houses with cool roofs may require more energy for heating – an effect known as the winter heating penalty. “In western Sydney, the balance has got to be [that] you don’t want to absorb the heat,” Pitman says. “But that’s not the case everywhere.” The effect is also complicated by how well a building is insulated. “Australian buildings are amongst the worst in the world,” Pitman says. “We are absolutely, unambiguously crap at building houses for optimal energy efficiency.” There are potential solutions in development, Pignatta says, such as thermochromic materials – those that change colour depending on temperature. “So in winter they become more dark, and they absorb more heat, and during summer they become more light.” What about black solar panels? Even though they are dark, one of the advantages of solar panels is that they are designed to convert solar energy into electricity, Pitman says. “The roof isn’t heating up, it’s using the energy to create electricity.” Excessively high temperatures can reduce the efficiency of solar panels, Pignatta says, and may be more efficient when installed on light roofs or those made of reflective materials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/nov/10/california-solar-energy-ponzi-scheme-sentencing","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-11T02:12:54Z","webTitle":"Luxury cars, vacation homes: solar energy Ponzi scheme defrauded investors of $1bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/10/california-solar-energy-ponzi-scheme-sentencing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/nov/10/california-solar-energy-ponzi-scheme-sentencing","fields":{"headline":"Luxury cars, vacation homes: solar energy Ponzi scheme defrauded investors of $1bn","bodyText":"A San Francisco Bay Area man has been sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for running an audacious solar energy Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $1bn, the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the district’s history. Jeff Carpoff, the 50-year-old owner of the solar energy company DC Solar, was sentenced on Tuesday. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 47, faces up to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty at the same time to money laundering and conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. The couple started DC Solar, based in Benicia, as a legitimate company that made solar generators mounted on trailers, prosecutors said. But the company was later used in an “egregious scheme” to scam its investors, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. The Carpoffs used the money to buy and invest in more than 150 luxury cars, 32 properties, a subscription to a private jet service, a semipro baseball team, a Nascar racecar sponsorship and a suite at the new Las Vegas Raiders stadium. The couple has agreed to forfeit more than $120m in assets, including a fleet of collector cars and vacation homes in the Caribbean, Mexico, Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas purchased entirely with cash. Prosecutors said they intend to use the assets in partial restitution to victims of the fraud. The government already auctioned off 148 vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by late actor Burt Reynolds, netting more than $8.2m. DC Solar marketed its generators between 2011 and 2018 as being able to provide emergency power for cellphone companies or to provide lighting at sporting and other events. But prosecutors say the owners began telling investors they could benefit from federal tax credits by leasing the generators back to DC Solar, which would then provide them to other companies for their use. In fact, prosecutors say the generators never provided much income, and early investors were paid with funds from later investors. Carpoff and others covered up the scheme with fake financial statements and lease contracts, prosecutors said. They eventually stopped building the mobile generators altogether, and at least half the company’s claimed 17,000 generators didn’t really exist, prosecutors said. Instead, they said Carpoff and others said the generators were in locations where they did not really exist. They traded identification number stickers on generators that had been constructed previously. And they hoodwinked investors during equipment inspections. “He claimed to be an innovator in alternative energy, but he was really just stealing money from investors and costing the American taxpayer hundreds of millions in tax credits,” Talbert said. The company was involved in $2.5bn in investment transactions between 2011 and 2018, costing investors $1bn, prosecutors said earlier. Among the investors was Berkshire Hathaway, which lost about $340m. The case represents the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the federal court district that covers inland northern California, according to acting US attorney Phillip Talbert. “Carpoff’s egregious scheme fueled his rapacious desire for luxury and prominence with showy, public expenditures,” said Sean Ragan, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Sacramento field office. Aside from the Carpoffs, five others have pleaded guilty to related offenses and are awaiting sentencing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Leading climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe: ‘You have the ability to use your voice’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","fields":{"headline":"Leading climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe: ‘You have the ability to use your voice’","bodyText":"Katharine Hayhoe has wrestled with her climate footprint. The climate scientist, who is now chief scientist for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, was shocked when she realized how much of her personal emissions came from work travel. But are these more justifiable because her work is educating people about the climate crisis? There has long been a debate about how much individual actions matter when it comes to climate. The oil industry’s promotion of the concept of the carbon footprint has led some to believe that the whole idea is a huge distraction technique to divert attention from corporations driving the crisis. But as Greta Thunberg demonstrates, individuals can have a big impact, just not always in ways that can be measured. Part of the challenge is that we have no good way to conceptualize our impact as individuals. I came up with the concept of a “climate shadow” to try to help visualize how the sum of our life choices influences the climate emergency. Your shadow includes the car you drive and what you eat, but it’s also about where you work, how you engage in the workplace, where you invest your money and how much you talk about climate. I spoke with Hayhoe about the limitations of the carbon footprint, the impact we can have as employees and community members, and why it may be more profound than we think. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. There’s an ongoing debate about individual responsibility versus corporate responsibility when it comes to carbon emissions and the climate crisis. A lot of people feel as if there’s nothing they can do to make a difference – we’re just individuals. And yet, corporations are made up of individuals. Absolutely. I mean, look [at the climate strikes] at Amazon, that really shows the power of individual people using their voices. When you look at how change has happened before with corporations, with governments, with cities, it’s because one or two or three or four people began by using their voice, and typically they were not the people at the top. It reminds me of a story in my book about a guy who works for a big hospital in New York. He was horrified to find out that their pension fund was invested in fossil fuels when fossil fuel air pollution is responsible for almost 9m premature deaths a year. He said: “Isn’t our Hippocratic oath to do no harm?” So he talked to the pension fund about it and they said: “well, we don’t care.” Then he started a petition. He started going around the hospital talking to the doctors, the nurses, and the other people who work there, saying, “would you be interested in signing this petition?” I don’t even know if he has succeeded yet, he hadn’t when I wrote the book, but that’s what he’s doing. That’s his attempt to use his voice. Everybody has a voice, and wherever you work, you have the ability to use your voice. One of the reasons I created the climate shadow was my frustration with the carbon footprint and how it devalues actions that can’t be measured, such as voting or activism. Can you speak a little bit about the tension between higher impact actions that can’t be measured and actions that have less impact but can be measured? I think that climate shadow is such a powerful concept. Ten years ago I stepped on the carbon scale, so to speak, to measure my carbon footprint. I was genuinely shocked to find out that the biggest part of it was my travel. I was going to a lot of scientific meetings and going places to talk to people about climate change. I decided that I was going to transition most of my talks to virtual talks and when I traveled, I was going to bundle my talks. One of my last bundled trips was to Alaska, where I visited three different cities and did 28 events with an average of 75 people per event. So I spoke to about 2,000 people and I calculated that if eight individual people reduced their individual carbon footprint by 10% as a result of listening to me talk – and a 10% reduction is very easy to achieve – then that was the carbon of my flight. Now let’s extrapolate this. Say that I put solar panels on my house. That’s great. But what if my place of work transitions to clean energy? You can calculate the difference, we’re talking orders of magnitude. But my place of work is only going to transition to solar energy if someone starts the conversation. Your recent book, Saving Us, is focused on hope and fighting hopelessness. And it does seem that if we want to tackle that hopelessness, the most important thing we can do is empower people within their corporate and political groups. Can you speak to that? Somehow we see corporations as not being made up of people, but they are made up of people. Every big organization is made up of people. In some corporations, the leadership is aware of the problem but they’re not sure what to do. In some cases, they would make a change, but people just haven’t called for it. We often have the image of corporations being completely immovable, but they’re made up of people who want to do the right thing. Even in the fossil fuel industry, there are people at those corporations who want to do the right thing. Often people feel that they’re just trying to hold on to their jobs and survive. How do we navigate that so people aren’t like: ‘Oh great, now I have to also be a climate warrior on top of just trying to not get fired’? We think of climate change as a separate issue on our priority list, but the only reason you care about climate change is because of what’s already at the top of your list – keeping your job, taking care of your family, worrying about your health, worrying about your kids, worrying about the place where you live – whatever it is that you’re already worrying about. When you are taking action for climate, it’s not for climate change, it’s for you. It’s for your family, it’s for everything you love, everyone you love, every place that you love – that’s why you’re doing it. There’s a significant mind shift there, so that we don’t see it as an extra “to do” on our list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T05:38:10Z","webTitle":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","bodyText":"Central Melbourne has the potential to generate three-quarters of its electricity needs from solar power, according to new modelling. By integrating more solar panels into roofs, walls and windows, the City of Melbourne could generate 2,354 gigawatt hours of energy a year – equivalent to 74% of its current electricity consumption, the Monash University research suggests. Prof Jacek Jasieniak, a co-author of the study, said the capacity of solar panels currently installed in central Melbourne was only a fraction of what was possible. “There’s a massive opportunity to build photovoltaics into a city, and Melbourne CBD … could be, as a collective, a distributed energy powerhouse,” he said. The modelling focused on the City of Melbourne, a 37.4 sq km municipal area that includes the central business district, mid-rise developments in the inner-city suburbs of Carlton and South Yarra, and the industrial area of Port Melbourne. Rooftop panels accounted for the vast majority – 88% – of the potential solar energy the area could generate. Generating 2,354 gigawatt hours annually was “an ambitious target,” Jasieniak said. “That’s assuming that you’re getting pretty high-efficiency devices and you’re covering about 80% of the rooftops that are available.” To produce that amount of energy, Jasieniak estimated several million solar panels would need to be installed in central Melbourne. The researchers used 3D models that simulated how much sunlight would illuminate buildings during the day. The modelling took into account seasonal variations in the direction of the sun, the shadows cast by buildings, and building properties such as rooftop space and window-to-wall ratios. Jasieniak said the challenge was that many buildings have multiple tenants “and it’s not clear whose responsibility is it to ensure that there are maximised photovoltaics on those buildings”. The study made calculations based on the efficiency of PERC photovoltaic cells, an existing rooftop solar technology developed by University of New South Wales researcher Martin Green. It also assumed that solar panels would be integrated into building facades and windows, generating 8% and 4% of the calculated energy respectively. “True building-integrated photovoltaics replaces the wall,” Jasieniak said. While the technology to do that exists, he said, “it hasn’t been done at scale” on buildings in Australia yet. Solar windows – photovoltaic cells that generate energy but are transparent like glass – have been less commercially viable to date, because of their low efficiency of only 2% to 3%, Jasieniak said. “We’re working on technologies that increase efficiency by a factor of four or five.” His research group Exciton Science is collaborating with the CSIRO to develop solar windows made of a crystal material known as perovskite. Producing solar electricity close to where it is used minimises energy losses during transmission. “It needs to be a distributed network,” Jasieniak said, meaning it is spread across the city. He said there needs to be photovoltaics in fields to support areas where high density or solar integration was not possible. “You also want it to be in cities and in buildings.” Future building design could take sunlight and shadowing into account to maximise the potential of solar power, Jasieniak said. “In Melbourne, you could imagine that you could have slightly higher buildings towards the southern part of the city, so they can capture as much of that northerly sun as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T23:38:33Z","webTitle":"Australia puts fossil fuel company front and centre at Cop26","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","fields":{"headline":"Australia puts fossil fuel company front and centre at Cop26","bodyText":"The Australian government has been criticised for prominently hosting a fossil fuel company at its pavilion at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The condemnation came as the Morrison government confirmed it would not join about 90 countries in backing the official launch of a global pledge to reduce emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas leaked during gas and coal extraction and released by livestock – by 30% by 2030. The Australian pavilion in the Scottish Event Campus exhibition centre has been a hub of activity during the first two days of the summit. With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison’s address to the conference on Monday. Space in the pavilion has been dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest’s green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos. At the front of the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund. Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, joined Santos’ chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the pavilion to trumpet the announcement. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was “a pity” Australia had not signed up to the pledge and “a joke” that Santos had been given prime placement. “Look at the Australian stand – you’ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy policy should be all about burning gas,” Turnbull told reporters. “The whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels. “We’ve got to cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. We can’t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global warming now.” Taylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos chief while launching the government’s latest low-emissions technology statement – an annual update of its technology-driven approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority technologies chosen to get government support. The minister said Santos’ CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a “very elegant project” that would allow it to produce gas while reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production sites and in the development of “blue” hydrogen using gas. “We can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the production of hydrogen,” he said. “This is not new, it’s very, very important, it’s going to be particularly important for the gas industry.” Asked about the global methane pledge, he said Australia’s focus was “whole of economy, all gasses”. “We’re not setting sector-specific targets and we’re not setting gas-specific targets,” he said. Taylor last week claimed signing up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to meet it would be to “start shooting your cattle”. Bill Hare, the chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was not correct. The government’s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its support for CCS technology – both burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using captured carbon dioxide to make products – includes $250m for a “CCS technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in Glasgow, said the Morrison government was spending Cop26 “busy hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for the gas industry”. The Australian Conservation Foundation said Australia was acting “shamelessly”. “Make no mistake, the Morrison government’s preoccupation with CCS is about keeping coal and gas Australia’s energy system longer, and delaying the transition to renewable energy with storage,” said ACF’s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean. Taylor said the government was backing renewable energy by adding “ultra low-cost solar” as a priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said. “We welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production – green, blue – they are important,” he said. “You will see green growing rapidly over time, we certainly hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T18:36:57Z","webTitle":"Cop26: Boris Johnson says ‘the eyes of the world are on our negotiators’ as world leaders leave climate conference – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","fields":{"headline":"Cop26: Boris Johnson says ‘the eyes of the world are on our negotiators’ as world leaders leave climate conference – as it happened","bodyText":"The conference is over for today. So it’s goodbye from me for now. We’ll be back tomorrow morning, but here’s a roundup of what’s happened this afternoon: Boris Johnson has declared he is “cautiously optimistic” about a deal at Cop26 to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C as he urged China to commit to bringing emissions down by 2025. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Reducing these emissions was touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating ahead of the summit. A plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders, including the UK, US, India and China. The prime minister of Rwanda has told of how his country has witnessed the impact of climate change “first hand, including floods, draughts and landslides have cost livelihoods ... and cost many lives.” African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has defended his trip to space telling delegates that it made him realise how “finite and fragile” the Earth is. And Police Scotland has apologised to women in Glasgow who had to walk home in darkness on Monday night after well-lit streets were blocked off due to Cop26 climate summit security concerns. Youth and Indigenous activists, and others most affected by climate change, staged an action marking the end of the World Leaders Summit just opposite the conference centre on Tuesday evening, calling on negotiators to “End Climate Betrayal” with concrete action over the next two weeks. Holding up huge illuminated letters, the action follows on from the open letter to world leaders sent by Greta Thunberg, Vanessa Nakate and Mitzi Tan to enact a 5-point plan for the climate, which has been signed by more than one million people globally. More reaction to the Biden methane pledge from earlier today. Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, says: “As things stand, methane is mostly just a distraction from the main job of ridding the world economy of fossil fuel burning and its associated carbon dioxide emissions.” Actions to control methane are only really useful if the planet is on track to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the next few decades. He said: “We are sadly not yet in that world, and until we are, methane is just a sideshow.” Professor Myles Allen, professor of Geosystem science at Oxford, said a 30% cut in global methane emissions would reduce global temperatures by around one-tenth of a degree. “Meanwhile, carbon dioxide emissions are driving temperatures up by over two-tenths of a degree per decade. Unless we get carbon dioxide on a path to net zero by mid-century, action on methane today won’t have much impact on peak warming,” he said. Johnson said companies and financial institutions have an important role in stopping deforestation and that consumer pressure is also key. Lastly, asked whether President Macron left early after falling out with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson says: “We are working very closely with our French friends and partners on the things that matter most to the people of the world, which are climate change and reducing CO2.” Asked about India’s net zero target being for 2070, Johnson says: “I think the most important thing that they’ve said is that they want to decarbonise so much of their power system by 2030. That’s a massive commitment.” On China, he says it is engaging on the matter of climate change but that the world needs more progress from the Asian country. “I think we need China to make commitments, China has made a substantial commitment to move to net zero by the middle of the century, 2050 or before. Let’s see where we get to with China ... let’s see where that adds up to.” He adds that China has committed to stop financing overseas coal. Asked about President Xi Jinping of China’s lack of attendance at Cop26, Johnson says you have to respect his decision not to come to the summit “because of the pandemic”. He said Russian president Vladimir Putin is not attending for the same reason. More from Johnson: “If we don’t fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe. I also happen to think there is a great wisdom in the British people that think this is an issue that needs to be fixed.” He refers to a graph presented yesterday by Sir David Attenborough depicting the increase in CO2 emissions. “They can see that, they’re not dumb,” he says. He says the climate crisis will be tackled by creating high-wage, high-skilled jobs in green technologies. Asked by a Daily Express journalist whether there should be a public vote on net zero, he says: “As for your brilliant suggestion of a referendum, I think this country has had quite enough referendums to be getting on with.” Speaking about the impact of the climate crisis, Johnson says: “When it comes to helping countries to transition, there is a huge amount to do. We have the tools to do it. And we certainly have, in theory, the finance to do it. Mark Carney would say hundreds of trillions of dollars, others would say tens of trillions, that can be leveraged by the public sector and by our investment. But I’m not going to disagree with anyone that says the world has a lot more to do.” Boris Johnson tells the BBC’s Laura Kuenssburg that we are starting to see the plans behind the pledges made in Paris in 2015. He says: “I think what you are starting to see here is a sense of how actually you can deliver those cuts in CO2.” However, he admits there is still a lot of work to do to put plans into practice. “The world leaders may be leaving, but the eyes of the world are on our negotiators and we have your numbers,” says Johnson, who is due to fly back to London this evening. Johnson continues: “We’ve been asking for action on coal, cars, cash and trees and after just a couple of days we can certainly begin to tick three of those boxes – we are beginning to write the tick. “That’s all happened because we have been able to come together in Glasgow.” He goes on to say that the clock in the doomsday scenario is still ticking but says “we have a bomb disposal team on site and they are starting to snip some of the wires, some of the right wires I hope.” Johnson is reeling off what he perceives to be successes from the Cop26 summit so far. He says that 90% of the world’s economy is now working towards net zero, including “India keeping 1bn tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere by switching half its power grid to renewable energy”. He added: “It’s not just that we are putting forward better or bigger targets but the world is putting forward the plans to reach those targets.” Johnson adds: “90% of the world has now signed up to net zero including India,” in reference to yesterday’s announcement from India. “We will keep working with world leaders to get to net zero sooner.” Johnson starting to speak: “We must take care to guard against false hope... still a very long way to go. I am cautiously optimistic... After two days of talks we’ve pulled back a goal or two from being 1-5 down.” As we wait for Boris Johnson’s press conference we can update you with some choice words that climate activist Greta Thunberg had for the world leaders inside the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Joined by some of the many activists rallying around the climate change meeting, Thunberg decried inaction from politicians and big business, saying: “We are not going to let them get away with it anymore.” The Boris Johnson press conference is due to start at 5pm today. We will be covering Cop26 related updates here on this blog. For other non-Cop26 updates please follow my colleagues on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog. The prime minister of Rwanda has told of how his country has witnessed the impact of climate change “first hand”. Édouard Ngirente told the Cop26 summit: “We have fallen short of our duty to both people and the planet if we don’t urgently address climate change. In Rwanda, we have seen first hand the impact of climate change – floods, draughts and landslides have cost livelihoods ... and cost many lives.” He called on world leaders to “keep alive” the 1.5C warming target and said Rwanda “pledges its full support for inclusive and transparent negotiation and dialogue between partners around the world”. The EU has pledged €1bn to protect the world’s forests, after world leaders agreed a deal to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade. China, the US and Brazil are among the countries that have signed up to the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use, which aims to protect vast areas of land, from tropical rainforests to Siberian taiga. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the money on Tuesday and said forest protection was an integral part of the EU’s trade deals, such as with Japan. “Forests are the green lungs of the earth. We need to protect and restore them. I gladly announce that we are pledging €1 billion to protect world forests. This is a clear sign of the EU’s commitment to lead global change to protect our planet, in line with our EU Green Deal.” Of the EU’s €1bn, €250m will go to the Congo basin, home to the world’s second-largest rainforest. Von der Leyen also said the Commission would propose an EU regulation to prevent deforestation driven by EU consumption. Leaked versions of the draft law – due to be published the week after COP26 negotiations conclude – have already been criticised by scientists for incorrect use of data and by NGOs for failure to protect vulnerable grasslands and wetlands that are rich in biodiversity. In a major step forward for ocean conservation in the global south, four Pacific-facing Latin American nations have said they will create what is essentially a mega-MPA – a huge interconnected marine protection area in one of the world’s richest pockets of ocean biodiversity. Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica said the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR) would not only join but expand their protected territorial waters to create a fishing-free corridor of ocean. The area is one of the world’s most important migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks and rays, but has been under threat from mostly foreign industrial fishing vessels, predominantly huge Chinese “distant fleets”, as well as illegal, underreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by locals. Ecuador took the first step earlier today, by announcing it would expand the current area of the Galápagos marine reserve by about 60,000 sq km. Greenpeace has put out a statement responding to the earlier US and EU-led pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of the Greenpeace delegation at Cop26, has said: The IPCC says we need to cut all emissions in half by 2030 if we hope to keep global temperature rises within 1.5C. If we drastically slash fossil fuels we’d cut methane and carbon emissions at the same time, and have a much better chance of meeting that goal. And by not including meat reduction or pledges to change people’s diets in this commitment, governments are giving a free pass to big agriculture. All roads end up pointing to the need to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system and phasing out industrial meat and dairy from our diets as soon as possible. This announcement dodges what’s needed.” If you wondered how optimistic climate scientists are about whether world leaders can tackle the climate crisis, the answer is, sadly, not very. An anonymous survey by Nature found many to be anxious or distressed, with six in ten of the respondents expecting the world to warm by at least 3C by the end of the century, compared with what conditions were like before the Industrial Revolution. The Irish premier, Micheál Martin, has said countries in the developed world have “an obligation” to support the nations most impacted by climate change. The taoiseach announced that Ireland would double its contribution to developing countries and would deliver at least €225m a year by 2025. He said: “If we act decisively now, we will offer humanity the most valuable prize of all, a liveable planet. We can achieve a cooler world. A biodiverse world. A world with healthier air for us to breathe, healthier soil for things to grow in. A world in which people can live more sustainable lives, handing a healing and enriched planet to future generations.” He added: “Those of us in the developed world, those who have, frankly, contributed most to the problems that confront us all have an obligation to support those who are most acutely challenged by their consequences. Ireland accepts that obligation.” The director and actor Fehinti Balogun has been at the conference this week talking about his show Can I live?, which uses hip-hop and spoken word to explore the ways people of colour have been excluded from environmental activism. Giving a speech last night, he said: I wanted to speak on behalf of the people this show represents: my mum, my cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my siblings, the people that look like me, that come from the places I come from. What would they want me to say? It is probably not about carbon credits or legislation. It’d be much simpler. I imagine it’d be a question: What are you gonna do? I mean ‘you’ because it’s hard to feel like ‘we’ when you often feel like them or other. It’s hard to say we when it is clear that we don’t have the same immediate power as you. The UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith has been speaking about the pledges by 114 world leaders to end deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, which has been coordinating behind the scenes ahead of Cop26. Although there has been great fanfare about the deal today, even backed by Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro, it remains unclear about how commitments will be tracked and what ending deforestation actually means. “Clearly, monitoring is essential. There’s a lot of work going on at the moment to figure out exactly how different ecosystems in different parts of the world can be measured. But I am not convinced there is a single answer,” Lord Goldsmith said. “We’re talking about very significant sums of money. And of course, it’s public money. So the public will want to know that that money is being spent properly. That hasn’t always been the case in the past in relation to well intentioned investments to try and stop deforestation. “Countries making the Glasgow forest pledge will need to be able to demonstrate that money is being invested and it’s not being spent to subsidise failure.” Sauli Niinistö, the president of Finland, has reiterated the pledge for his country to become carbon-neutral by 2035. He said: “Ensuring adequate climate finance is crucial - Finland is doing its part by almost doubling its climate finance to developing countries.” He also told the Cop26 conference that as an Arctic country, Finland is “particularly concerned about the fast-warming Arctic region”. He said that as the most forested country in Europe, every year 150 million trees are planted in Finland, adding that “globally we need to strengthen efforts to halt forest loss... Now it is the time to deliver on our pledges and shoulder our human responsibilities,” he said. The US president, Joe Biden, has told the Cop26 summit that “our current technology alone won’t get us to where we need to be”. Speaking in Glasgow, the president insisted that setting ambitious climate targets was “only half the equation” and announced the launch of the First Movers Coalition. The coalition will bring together “more than two dozen of the world’s largest, most innovative companies” from eight sectors contributing emissions. He also said innovation should not be restricted to just the industrial sector but highlighted the “vital part to play” for the agricultural sector also. The US would lead by example and share innovations, he added. “There is virtually nothing we are unable to do, particularly if we do it together,” he said. The First Movers Coalition is part of the Breakthrough Agenda announced earlier this afternoon – a global plan to drive down the cost of clean technologies. My colleague Damian Carrington has a writeup of that story. Meanwhile, it seems Biden was given a very special welcome to Scotland this morning on his journey to Glasgow. Boris Johnson’s spokesman has sounded a more upbeat note about Cop26 today compared with the prime minister’s words at the weekend, warning about the risk of failure at Glasgow. The UK as hosts are understood to be pleased by progress on forests and the new 2030 commitment from India, but acknowledge that work on climate financing is proving very difficult. Asked whether Johnson’s weekend gloom had been expectation management, the spokesman said: “The PM felt very much at the G20 that limited progress was made but was by no means the significant boost that was needed. What we’ve seen so far is some early signs that we are starting to make some progress. Again, we are not complacent. This is not a done deal by any means. There is a huge amount of work left to do. “Currently we are at 2.7C and there is work to do to consider exactly what the commitments announced do to bring that down further, but we have absolutely not done enough to get us to 1.5 so the pressure will be kept up absolutely. It is just important to recognise when countries, when leaders do step up and make commitments that do require change, challenges and significant sums of investment.” Johnson has still not made a decision on whether to come back at the end of Cop26, and could make a statement from Downing Street on what is agreed rather than heading up to Glasgow again. Johnson is due to give a press conference at 5pm today before flying back to London. About 150 Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked Waterloo Street outside JP Morgan’s Glasgow offices. Protesters banged drums and chanted slogans highlighting the bank’s continued investment in fossil fuels as a sizeable police presence watched on. The protest, dubbed the “trillion-dollar bash”, then marched through busy streets and past Morgan Stanley’s offices before a wall of police blocked it from crossing the M8 motorway about 10 minutes from the SEC, where Cop26 is being held. A plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders, including the UK, US, India and China. A global transition to green energy and vehicles is vital in tackling the climate crisis and economies of scale mean that costs plummet as production ramps up, as already seen with solar panels and LED lightbulbs. Countries said they would align standards and coordinate investments to speed up production and bring forward the “tipping point” at which green technologies are more affordable and accessible than the fossil-fuelled alternatives. The first five breakthroughs being targeted are clean electricity, electric vehicles, green steel, hydrogen and sustainable farming, aiming to make these affordable and available to all nations by 2030 and potentially creating 20m new jobs. Boris Johnson said: By making clean technology the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice, the default go-to in what are currently the most polluting sectors, we can cut emissions right around the world Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has told delegates at Cop26 that his trip to space made him realise how “finite and fragile” the Earth is. Bezos said: “I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens from which you view the world. But I was not prepared for just how much that would be true.” Prince William had criticised billionaires embroiled in a space tourism race, saying the world’s greatest minds needed to focus on fixing the Earth instead. Bezos also told delegates that Amazon aims to power all its operations by 100% renewable energy by 2025 and is working to convert its delivery fleet to electrical vehicles. The US president, Joe Biden, has just announced a pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reported this morning, the US is leading an alliance of 90 countries to set out new regulatory measures to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. China, India and Russia have not joined the pact known as the Global Methane Pledge. Although methane breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, it is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Reducing these emissions was touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating ahead of the summit. This is what Durwood Zaelke, a lead reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in August: Cutting methane is the biggest opportunity to slow warming between now and 2040. In response to today’s announcement to end deforestation by 2030, Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, said it was a “Paris moment” for forests. “In Paris in 2016 the world’s leaders committed to recognise the concept of net zero, to draw a line in the sand around how much greenhouse gases can be allowed into the atmosphere,” he said. “Now in Glasgow they have committed to a similar aspiration for deforestation and land degradation, to stop and start reversing these by 2030.” More financial commitment would be needed, but it was striking to see such a significant declaration, especially one including big rainforest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and DRC, Prof Malhi said. Police in Glasgow have apologised after it emerged that women walking home after dark on Monday were stopped from using well-lit streets near the Cop26 summit, and told to use badly-lit routes instead. Residents near the Scottish Exhibition Centre venue on the Clyde said police told them to walk long distances through Kelvingrove park and other side streets to get to their homes, because more direct routes were shut down for security reasons. One claimed she was followed by a male officer, despite asking him to leave her. Police Scotland, which recently unveiled an enhanced strategy to promote women’s safety, said those diversions were temporary and imposed at short notice due to “real-time changes to operational plans.” Assistant chief constable Gary Ritchie said the diversion would not be introduced, and the force would talk to Glasgow city council about improved lighting in Kelvingrove park. “While late changes and some level of disruption is inevitable when policing an event the size and scale of Cop26, we understand and apologise for the concern these changes caused and for the inconvenience to those diverted. “We do, in particular, recognise and acknowledge the commentary from some women who had to walk through the park on their own last night, we want to keep everyone safe and we know that the onus is on us to recognise when we could provide some more support and visibility to reassure people in our communities.” UPDATE: My colleague Nina Lakhani has said: This happened to me last night! I had to walk back through unlit Kelvingrove Park, took an extra 30 minutes and was damn dangerous with the wet leaves. I asked a cop how I was meant to get home, and he suggested I come back the following day! We’re expecting to hear more speeches from World leaders this afternoon, including major oil exporters Kuwait and Bahrain. Last week, Bahrain joined Saudi Arabia in pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2060. A leak of documents prior to the conference found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) was lobbying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to remove recommendations that the world needs to phase out fossil fuels. Tom Levitt here taking over the live blog throughout the rest of the afternoon. You can email me at tom.levitt.casual@theguardian.com, or send me a message on Twitter at @tom_levitt. • This post was amended on 2 November 2021 to remove an incorrect suggestion that Bahrain is a member of Opec. It’s been a busy morning, as world leaders continued to make their statements, a massive forestry deal was announced which aims to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade. The key events so far: African countries will spend $6bn on adapting to climate impacts, says our environment correspondent Fiona Harvey. African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. ‘You might as well bomb us’, Surangel Whipps Jr, the president of Palau, told world leaders, speaking of the pain of watching his country suffer “a slow and painful death”. Ecuador to massively expand protected reserve around Galápagos islands, Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, Ecuador’s president, announced. The country would add an additional 60,000 sq km of protected ocean to the 130,000 sq km that already exist around the islands. World leaders agree deal to end deforestation, as we reported this morning. Xi Jinping, Jair Bolsonaro and Joe Biden are among the leaders signing the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forest and Land Use. And the US has rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, with the goal of achieving 1.5C goal at UN climate talks. It’s been a pleasure - my colleague Tom Levitt will now take over the blog for the rest of the afternoon. The Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, has asked rich nations how long his country, a non-polluter, has to “continue to do the right thing alone”. He said: “How long do we have to pay the price, first for the contribution to climate change of the big guys, then for their failure to remedy its consequences?” He bemoans the fact that Albania is forced to buy energy in winter when prices sky-rocket and, because of dry weather, the nation’s hydropower plants cannot meet demand. He added his country is “100% renewable” but said it cannot afford to wait around for “markets to move in the right direction” and called for international financial support through “grants, not loans”. “It is a noble stance to refuse any mixing of fossil fuels with our 100% renewable energy production. Some of the guys here may be able to afford it but for us it is literally a daily struggle,” he said. At a packed event at the Scotland Pavilion, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has made a statement calling for women and girls to be at the forefront of climate change discussions. The joint statement from the Scottish government and UN Women recognises that women and girls are commonly disproportionately affected by climate change. In a panel discussion with the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina; the president of Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan and the prime minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas, Sturgeon noted that girls were more likely to be taken out of school and women less able to find alternative forms of work as a result of climate impacts. African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. Félix Tshisekedi, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo and chair of the African Union, will today call on countries and philanthropist who have pledged help to Africa in the past to step forward. He has in mind countries such as the US, Canada and the EU bloc, and the tech mogul Bill Gates, who are expected to attend a meeting with the African Union later on Tuesday. The African adaptation Acceleration Plan was set out at the Paris summit in 2015 but remains largely unfunded as donors have been slow to come up with cash. Adaptation to the impacts of the climate crisis is a key issue at these talks. Africa is already facing serious impacts from climate breakdown in the form of long and deep droughts, flooding and storm surges in coastal areas, rising temperatures and heatwaves and damaging impacts on agriculture. But funding for adaptation has lagged well behind that for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Norway will double its climate financing contribution, Jonas Gahr Støre, the prime minister of Norway, has told Cop26, reiterating his country’s commitment to reducing its emissions and helping others to reduce theirs. He said: “We come to Glasgow with three firm commitments. First, we will follow up on the invitation by the British hosts, we are ready to double our climate financing contribution to more than $1.6bn by 2026.” He said Norway would work with development partners to help with renewable energy transition and to “phase out coal”, as well as launching a new climate investment initiative to help fund renewable energy in developing countries. “Second ... to work with business, industry and social partners to help us all succeed towards a renewable, circular and sustainable future,” he said. Støre said the Scandinavian country would “develop an export technology that can be used beyond our borders”. Finally, the prime minister insisted that the financial sector “must play its part” and announced that the Norwegian public pension fund would take the lead in responsible investment, basing its work on an overall long-term goal of net zero emissions from the companies it invests in. He concluded: “We cannot allow the inaction of some to be an argument for failing to take action together by the rest of us. Now is the time to step up.” Happy news! The UK has actually won something. Okay, it’s not really an honour: every day at every Cop, Climate Action Network hands out the ‘Fossil of the day award’ and yesterday they gave it to the UK Cop hosts. “CAN asked for a Cop postponement as we feared people from the developing world wouldn’t be able to come and advocate for climate justice in the face of the global Covid-19 pandemic,” they said in a statement. “But the UK presidency insisted that Cop26 was going ahead and was prepared to welcome the global community to ‘the most inclusive Cop ever’. This spirit of inclusivity has showcased what the Brits do best – the art of queuing – for hours in some cases. “People who have invested time and resources to travel to Glasgow have waited patiently only to find there is ‘no room at the inn’ for civil society and told to ‘join events online’ – to then find they were offline.” Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador’s Indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, has said: “We’re here to tell world leaders across the planet that indigenous people are here to make a pact for life – there is no more time, don’t make political promises or financial announcements about the climate if you are not going to keep them. “The decisions we make today will make the difference between whether we’re going to live, or we’re all going to perish.” He cautiously welcomed the $1.7bn of funding led by the governments of the UK, US, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands, but emphasised that what happens next is crucial. “The UK is now at a crossroads: they can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local communities,” he told the Guardian. Other campaigners said the pledge was a “first step” in making indigenous rights central to the climate crisis. No show by the Brazil delegation today at a press conference, where they were scheduled to talk on the subject of “strong environmental defence”. Make of that what you will. It follows a somewhat frosty reception for Jair Bolsonaro at last weekend’s G20 summit and a decidedly lukewarm reaction to Brazil’s latest climate plan. “I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action,” Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, has told world leaders. “For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but about what is happening today. “In our lifetime nature has gone from a vast expanse of biodiversity to a shadow of itself.” He points out, however, that they want to find a way to make a clean transition. “Nigeria is not looking to make the same mistakes that have been repeated for decades by others – we are looking for innovation in technology and finance to make a cleaner transition.” He also references his government’s commitment to electrifying 5 million households using decentralised solar energy solutions. Pension funds in the Nordic countries and UK have announced they will invest $130bn in clean energy and climate projects by 2030. As part of this commitment, the funds will also report every year on the progress of their climate investments. “Green transition requires massive investments,” said Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark. “Governments have to do their part but we also need private investors on board.” Peter Damgaard Jensen, a co-chair of the Climate Investment Coalition, said: “These critical steps ensure pensions take advantage of the enormous opportunities of the green transition, help spur immediate solutions to lower carbon emissions, while protecting our savings against the ravages of climate change.” Joe Biden has described Build Back Better World, a G7-launched project to help create sustainable infrastructure in lower-income countries, as a means to promote not just greener economies, but also democracy. Speaking at a Cop26 event alongside Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, the US president set out a series of priorities for the scheme, known as B3W for short, including climate resilience and local partnerships. He also added: “We have to show – and I think we will show – that democracy is still the best way for delivering results.” This latter focus is notable given B3W has been seen in part as a riposte to China’s longer-running Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure plan for developing countries seen as a way for Beijing to increase its influence on such nations. In his input, Johnson gave a nod to the UK’s plans to create new green employment, calling B3W “a global mission for jobs and growth”. In another look to his domestic audience, Johnson called it “global levelling up”. Systemic shifts are needed in order to provide a positive future for humans and nature, Prince Charles has just told Cop26. “We simply must talk about the solutions and actions we can start making, and taking, today,” he said. He said the first action is to “reengineer the world economic system” and reward countries for protecting forests. He endorsed the 30x30 biodiversity target as “truly critical” to reach that objective, and said countries should receive natural capital investments for protecting ecosystems. He highlighted the importance of honouring the rights of indigenous people and communities, saying that the rest of us have lost that “vital sixth sense” which stops us damaging nature in the first place. He finished by talking about the importance of changing how we produce and consume goods, decoupling production and consumption and building a more resilient circular economy. “Frankly, we’ve all had enough talking, so we need to put our commitments into practice,” he said. He says he has done speeches like this for the past 40 years all over the world, but to no avail. He hopes this one will be different. The president of the Pacific island nation of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, told the Cop26 summit that parallels can be drawn between the climate crisis and the tradition Palau story of a boy who grew into a giant who “wouldn’t stop growing”. “Due to his unruly appetite, the whole island community was forced to feed him ... depleting all the natural resources.” The islanders ultimately set the boy on fire after he turned on them and tried to eat them. Whipps Jr said pointed out that the story was “eerily reminiscent” of today’s climate crisis. “Large emitters with insatiable appetites are continuing to abuse our environment, threatening our very survival. Cop26 must light the fire.” He added that “devastated” island nations such as Palau, demand that commitments of $100bn annually be increased to meet the $4tn the World Bank says is needed to tackle climate change. “We see the scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat, the warming sea is invading us and the winds are blowing us every which way, our resources are disappearing before our eyes and our future is being robbed from us,” he added. “Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death - you might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and painful demise.” “Leaders of the G20, we are drowning and our only hope is the life-ring you are holding. You must act now, we must act together.” The Rainbow warrior is in Glasgow! Greenpeace sent their most famous ship up from Liverpool over the last couple of days: it sailed up the Clyde and docked yesterday. Onboard, alongside the Greenpeace team, are Bernard Ewekia, Jakapita Kandanga, Edwin Namakanga, Maria Reyes and Farzana Faruk Jhumu, who have travelled with the aim of speaking up for the sidelined citizens of the global south. In a comment piece on the Guardian today they say: In our home countries of Namibia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Mexico and Tuvalu in the South Pacific, we face many different challenges. But they are all exacerbated by the same injustices such as gender violence, forced migration and racial injustices, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. These are all symptoms of the same rotten system. We have friends who have dropped out of school because droughts have forced their families into poverty and famine. Others are forced to literally sell their children in order to meet their basic needs. Many people have lost land, homes and crops to floods and rising sea levels. More are being forced to flee their homes and communities. And even just accessing safe drinking water is a daily struggle for many. Thousands of people are dying right now because of the climate crisis: the world leaders at this summit have blood on their hands. Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, has addressed the main conference on behalf of Greenland, informing the conference that “dramatic climate change is already visible there ... Greenland has halted all new oil and gas exploration”. They believe that soon, 90% of the country’s electricity will be sustainably sourced. The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has announced that $2bn from the Bezos Earth fund has been allocated to stopping the destruction of nature. This is part of the $10bn initiative he announced last year for conservation, and follows a $1bn donation he pledged to focus on the Congo Basin, the tropical Andes and the Pacific Ocean. “When people hanker for the good old days and glamourise the past, they are wrong. By almost all metrics, life is better ... There is a notable exception: the natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago when we enjoyed unspoiled forest, clean rivers and the pristine air of the pre-industrial world,” he said. Just in case you were wondering, he mentioned his trip to space ... again. As the queue to get into the conference centre shows no sign of reducing or indeed moving, activists on the south side of the river are calling on world leaders to stop playing games with the climate. Dressed up as participants from the popular Netflix show Squid Game, these activists have assembled from across the globe under the banner Glasgow Actions to perform a series of eye-catching stunts during the early days of the summit. The Gabonese president, Ali Bongo, has just given a rousing speech at the forestry event in the Pen Y Fan room. The oil-rich nation is among the most forested countries in the world, with low rates of deforestation, and is home to the majority of the critically endangered African forest elephant. The world’s second-largest rainforest received £1.1bn in funding, including £200m from the UK, as part of the announcement on forests. “The Congo basin is the heart and lungs of the African continent. We cannot win the battle [on the climate] without the Congo rainforest. Our forests send rain to the Sahell and the Ethiopian highlands. They are critical to the African continent. Yet, the international community has consistently undervalued this critical ecosystem,” President Bongo says. “It is my hope that Glasgow will mark a turning point.” Ecuador has announced it will expand the protected marine reserve surrounding the Galápagos Islands, “the jewel of our biodiversity and a genuine living laboratory.” In a move long sought by local campaigners, Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, Ecuador’s president, said the country would add an additional 60,000 sq km of protected ocean to the 130,000 sq km that already exist around the islands. He noted that the Galápagos, famed for its crucial role in helping Charles Darwin develop the theory of natural selection, “is confronting serious threats due to global warming, plastic waste and other imbalances which are undermining our biodiversity, our food security and our economic and social development”. He added that the agreement was made via a “consensus between all of the involved sectors - fishing, tourism, conservation, and others”. The Guardian has reported extensively on how “distant fleet” fishing vessels, predominantly from China, have been decimating crucial fish stocks, including squid, on the very edge of the current Galápagos marine reserve. The new expansion “will not only strengthen the protection of the area’s biodiversity, but it will also bolster our combat against climate change”, Lasso said. The move should help fulfill Ecuador’s part of the UK-led 30 by 30 agreement, which commits to protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. In one note that may worry campaigners, Lasso also noted that the agreement would help achieve “growth in productivity for artisanal and industrial fishing”. The presidents of four Latin American countries, including Ecuador, are today expected to announce the merging of their marine protected areas into a “mega-MPA”. Klaus Werner Iohannis, the president of Romania, is speaking now. “There is no silver bullet against climate change. But a set of interconnected measures can help us deliver. “Romania has 40% of our electricity coming from renewable sources. We will expand this and fight climate change with nature-based solutions.” Meanwhile, at the forestry event, the US president has said that conserving the world’s forests and other critical systems is indispensable to meeting climate targets. He says forests provide clean water, host biodiversity and are home to indigenous communities. “Forests have the potential to reduce carbon globally by more than one third globally,” Biden tells the event, mentioning his decision to commit the US to protect 30% of land and sea by the end of the decade, including Tongass national forest in Alaska, the world’s largest temperate rainforest. Biden said he is launching a new plan to conserve forests in the US and around the world. He says he will make sure markets recognise the economic value of carbon sinks and create sustainable supply chains. “Let’s do this. It will have a generational impact,” he concludes. Insulate Britain protesters have blocked a major carriageway near Manchester Airport, in one of the climate group’s first protests outside of London. Footage from LBC on Twitter shows a small group of protestors in orange hi-vis jackets blocking the carriageway near the intersection of junction 6 of the M56 and the A538, as well as several police vans. The campaign group, which calls on the government to fund a national home insulation programme, said that it was the seventeenth time it had caused disruption on major roads, as it had also blocked roads in Birmingham and London. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have asked travellers to avoid the area if possible and said they are “working at the scene to minimise disruption”. The airport said the protest had no impact on operations but warned those planning to travel to the airport that they should take the possible delays into account, in a statement reported by the Liverpool Echo. On behalf of Insulate Britain, Gabby, 27, a graphic designer from Norwich said: “We are taking our message to people outside of London because we want everyone to know that our government is killing our children. Britain should be leading the world with radical plans to decarbonise our society, instead our government is actively setting policies that will drive emissions higher. The public can close their eyes but this isn’t going away, no one is coming to save you. We are being betrayed. This government is colluding in genocide.” The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, condemned the group’s actions in a tweet: Jeff Bezos has just arrived at the Cop26 forestry session, disappearing backstage with a small entourage including his partner, Lauren Sanchez. It’s not clear who he might be wanting to talk to at this session, but as well as Boris Johnson, Joe Biden is speaking now. The White House continues to have a mixed summit. After the confusion between Edinburgh and Glasgow yesterday, it has emerged today that plans to fly US president Joe Biden to Glasgow by helicopter have hit a snag because there are fears that the military vehicle would sink into the ground. Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, the president of Ecuador, is announcing a historic enlargement of the protected reserves around the historic Galapagos islands. Boris Johnson, Iván Duque and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, have taken the stage. The UK begins by paying tribute to Sir David Attenborough, “a giant redwood of environmental campaigners”. “Climate change and biodiversity are two sides of the same coin,” Johnson says. “We can’t tackle climate change without tackling biodiversity loss ... We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests.” Johnson says if we want to keep 1.5C in sight under the Paris agreement, we must protect and restore the world’s forests. He says 110 leaders have now signed the declaration on halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by the end of the decade. China, Russia and Brazil have all signed, he emphasises. He says a partnership between governments, the private sector, indigenous communities and philanthropists is key to addressing the drivers of deforestation. He says consumers will be able to enjoy “guilt-free chocolate” that is not linked to deforestation. He says he wants to mobilise global finance to protect nature. “Let’s work together to protect the forests but ensure the forests return,” he concludes. Boris Johnson has kicked off a Cop26 session on deforestation with a typically lyrical paean to the need to preserve woodlands. Speaking on a panel alongside the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, and the Colombian president, Iván Duque, Johnson peppered his speech with descriptions of “our three million-pillared cathedrals” and - in a section likely to have been challenging for the translators - some words on the need for “carbon guilt-free chocolate”. There was fury and frustration when it emerged that Karine Elharrar, Israel’s energy and water resources minister, who has muscular dystrophy, had been forced to wait for two hours outside after organisers refused to let her enter the compound in the vehicle in which she had arrived, she said. Her office said she was eventually offered a shuttle transport to the summit area, but the shuttle was not wheelchair-accessible, forcing her to return to her hotel in Edinburgh. Elharrar wrote on Twitter: “I came to Cop26 to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a common struggle in the climate crisis. It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not provide accessibility to its events.” It does appear that there is provision for wheelchair-users at the centre. The UK environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “We deeply regret that incident.” He added there appeared to have been a miscommunication and organisers had not been aware of Elharrar’s requirements in advance and so had not made the right provisions at the particular entrance she was coming to. “I know that at most of the other entrances, wheelchair access is there. It was because she came to an entrance where they didn’t have that provision,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that action should have been taken to resolve the issue. Our environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, has just revealed that the US is to rejoin the High Ambition Coalition. This is really excellent news: the HAC is a group that was formed in the run-up to Paris by the chief negotiator for the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum. It set the goal of holding temperatures to 1.5C. As Fiona writes: The goal of holding temperature rises to 1.5C rather than 2C is much harder to achieve, as it requires emissions cuts of at least 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. But science shows it is much safer – beyond 1.5C, many of the impacts of climate breakdown, such as melting ice sheets, become irreversible, and many small islands would face inundation from rising sea levels and storm surges. So far the queues have been one of the most memorable things about Cop26. There were brief hopes that that problem had been dealt with this morning after the organisers put out cordons. Unfortunately a hour or so later the situation had deteriorated and the queues were back. Maybe it’s just the way we prefer to do things here. Good morning! Welcome to day two of Cop26, where today the US president Joe Biden will unveil a plan to control methane, regarded by the administration as the single most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. Our colleague Patrick Wintour has written about it below. We’ll be covering all the main events of the day, including the second day of leaders’ speeches, and some key announcements around green technology.

Speaking at the world leaders’ summit at the UN conference in Glasgow, Narendra Modi made five key pledges for how India would decarbonise over the next few decades. India, a developing country of more than 1.3 billion people, is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide after the US and China. India was one of the last remaining major economies that had held out on a net zero commitment, despite months of pressure from the US, and Modi’s announcement marked one of the most significant moments of the summit’s opening day. Modi also made significant shorter-term commitments, promising to have 50% of India’s power generated by renewable energy by 2030, increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 and reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030. By 2030, he also committed to a 45% reduction in the carbon intensity of the economy. While the 2070 net zero target falls behind the 2050 commitment made by the US and Europe and the 2060 commitment made by China and Saudi Arabia, it is in line with what many climate experts have modelled as the most feasible scenario for India to achieve net zero. A recent report released by the Delhi-based thinktank the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) put forward 2070 to 2080 as India’s most realistic roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality. “India has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world,” said Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of CEEW. “This is real climate action.” Unlike countries in the west, and even China, India is decades away from its peak in terms of economic growth and energy consumption, and India’s energy demand is expected to grow faster than any other country over the next few years. Its population is also expected to overtake that of China to make it the largest in the world. Currently, 70% of all power in India is generated by coal, and while it is one of the cheapest producers of solar energy in the world, there is still not the technology available to integrate it into the energy grid on a large scale. Advancements in hydrogen technology and storage will also be needed to help India’s industrial sector wean itself off coal, which is unlikely to happen until around 2040, according to experts. India is already bearing the harsh consequences of climate breakdown. Millions across the country are exposed to severe heat, water shortages, extreme weather events such as flooding and coastal erosion, which have all been increasing in recent years. In the build-up to the conference, Indian officials had appeared to rebuff calls to commit to net zero, emphasising instead the need for climate funding and climate justice for developing countries, who historically have emitted far less greenhouses gas than countries such as the US but are now bearing the economic costs that come with net zero commitments. The commitments drew praise from the eminent climate ecologist Nicholas Stern, who said: “This was a very significant moment for the summit. [The action] might mean that India’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030. This demonstrates real leadership from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond [and] deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.” In his speech, Modi called out previous commitments of climate finance as “hollow” and demanded developed countries make $1tn available as climate finance to developing countries “as soon as possible today”. Modi told his fellow world leaders: “I am sure that the decisions taken in Glasgow will safeguard the future of generations to come and give them a safe and prosperous life.” He apologised for running over his allotted speech time but said he believed it was his “duty to raise my voice for developing countries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/01/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-01T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","bodyText":"The problem: rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The level of CO2 has been rising since the Industrial Revolution and is now at its highest for about 4m years. The rate of the rise is even more striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. The causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. The slight reduction in 2020 due to coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip” in the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The causes (III): farming Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and emissions are increasing faster now than at any time in 40 years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites are responsible. The consequences: global temperature rise The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. The consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai. The consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. The upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and tackle difficult sectors such as aviation and farming. The upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream. The upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating green hydrogen, will also be needed.

Particularly disappointing is the miserly support for low carbon energy. Energy companies have made some impressive investments in wind-powered and solar energy in Britain, but businesses will invest only where the risks are relatively low and the likelihood of profits relatively high. That leaves a whole range of actions that must be taken to decarbonise the economy, but where the private sector will not venture. Only the government has the economic power to take the risks that business shies away from, but Rishi Sunak has failed to pledge government support for decarbonisation to industry. David Humphreys Professor of environmental policy, Open University • In this week’s Cop26, countries will be urged to follow the UK’s “lead” in setting the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal is impossible for any advanced economy based on mass consumption. The majority of British manufacturing has shifted abroad, where labour is cheap and items are mostly produced with electricity supplied by coal and other fossil fuels. For a real figure for Britain’s emissions, the consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. It is a dangerous nonsense for rich countries, therefore, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a child born in Africa. For a meaningful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over PR. We may pull the wool over our own eyes, but nature cannot be cheated. Michael Stone Moretonhampstead, Devon • Your print headline, “A thundering wake-up call” (Report, 26 October), highlights a recent UN report that the world faces a disastrous temperature rise of at least 2.7C if countries fail to strengthen their climate pledges. With the Cop26 summit, hopes are high for pledges that will keep the planet from warming by no more than 1.5C, but expectations are low. We can expect the “blah blah blah” (to coin a phrase) to include planting more trees, replacing diesel and petrol cars with electric vehicles, more insulation of homes, more offshore wind farms and solar panels. Not now, but by 2050. The prime minister is looking for a pledge by developed countries for $100bn for less wealthy nations to help them adapt to climate change. Here is an alternative suggestion: let the rich nations pledge $100bn to a climate crisis project group consisting of the world’s top scientists. A bit like the Manhattan Project (but not trying to make an atomic bomb), these scientists will be charged with developing new tools in the fight to save the planet, such as technologies to scrub the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and store renewable energy. In the face of a crisis, human ingenuity knows no bounds. Dr Steve Hyer Wellington, Surrey • The sound of fiddles being tuned up and deckchairs scraping across decks are all we will hear at Cop26. It is left to us, citizens, parents and children, to fight for a future for the planet, and attempt to do all we can individually, as well as pressurising those who wield power, but are refusing to use it for the good of the children now being born into a bleak future.

But there is good news: we already have every tool we need to beat it. The challenge is not identifying the solutions, but rolling them out with great speed. Some key sectors are already racing ahead, such as electric cars. They are already cheaper to own and run in many places – and when the purchase prices equal those of fossil-fueled vehicles in the next few years, a runaway tipping point will be reached. Electricity from renewables is now the cheapest form of power in most places, sometimes even cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants. There’s a long way to go to meet the world’s huge energy demand, but the plummeting costs of batteries and other storage technologies bodes well. And many big companies are realising that a failure to invest will be far more expensive as the impacts of global heating destroy economies. Even some of the biggest polluters, such as cement and steel, have seen the green writing on the wall. Buildings are big emitters but the solution – improved energy efficiency – is simple to achieve and saves the occupants money, particularly with the cost of installing technology such as heat pumps expected to fall. Stopping the razing of forests requires no technology at all, but it does require government action. While progress is poor – and Bolsonaro’s Brazil is going backwards – countries such as Indonesia have shown regulatory action can be effective. Protecting and restoring forests, particularly by empowering indigenous people, is a potent tool. Recognition of the role food and farming play in driving global heating is high, and the solutions, from alternatives to meat to regenerative farming, are starting to grow. As with fossil fuels, ending vast and harmful subsidies is key, and there are glimmers of hope here, too. In the climate crisis, every fraction of a degree matters and so every action reduces people’s suffering. Every action makes the world a cleaner and better place to live – by, for example, cutting the air pollution that ends millions of lives a year. The real fuel for the green transition is a combination of those most valuable and intangible of commodities: political will and skill. The supply is being increased by demands for action from youth strikers to chief executives, and must be used to face down powerful vested interests, such as the fossil fuel, aviation and cattle industries. The race for a sustainable, low-carbon future is on, and the upcoming Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow will show how much faster we need to go. Transport Responsible for 14-28% of global greenhouse gas emissions, transport has been slow to decarbonise, and faces particular challenges in areas such as long-haul flight. But technical solutions are available, if the will, public policy and spending are there, too. Electric cars are the most obvious: petrol and diesel vehicles will barely be produced in Europe within the decade. EV sales are accelerating everywhere, with the likes of Norway well past the tipping point, and cheaper electric vehicles coming from China have cut the fumes from buses. Meanwhile, combustion engines are ever more efficient and less polluting. Bike and scooter schemes are growing rapidly as cities around the world embrace electric micromobility. Far cleaner ships for global freight are coming. The potential of hydrogen is growing, for cleaner trains where electrification is impractical, to be followed by ships and even, one day, planes. Manufacturers expect short-haul electric aircraft much sooner. Most of all, the pandemic has shown that a world without hypermobility is possible – and that many people will accept, or even embrace, a life where they commute and travel less. Gwyn Topham Deforestation Deforestation and land use change are the second-largest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The destruction of the world’s forests has continued at a relentless pace during the pandemic, with millions of hectares lost, driven by land-clearing in the Brazilian Amazon. But there are reasons for hope. The UK has put nature at the heart of its Cop26 presidency and behind the scenes, the government is pushing hard for finance and new commitments from forested nations to protect the world’s remaining carbon banks. Indonesia and Malaysia, once global hotspots of deforestation, have experienced significant falls in recent years, the result of increased restrictions on palm oil plantations. However, the 2000s soy moratorium in Brazil shows these trends are reversible. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the importance of indigenous communities to protecting the world’s forests and biodiversity. In the face of racism and targeted violence, a growing number of studies and reports show they are the best guardians of the forest. Empowering those communities will be vital to ending deforestation. Patrick Greenfield Technology Emissions from technology companies, including direct emissions, emissions from electricity use and other operations such as manufacturing, account for 0.3% of global carbon emissions, while emissions from cryptocurrencies is a huge emerging issue. Mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process and only gets more energy-intensive as the algorithms grow more complex. But new mining methods are lighter, environmentally. A system called “proof of stake” has a 99% lower carbon footprint. Scrutiny of the whole sector is increasing, spearheaded by tech workers who walked out in their hundreds to join climate change marches in 2019. The companies have pledged to do better: Amazon aims to be net zero carbon by 2040 and powered with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Facebook has a target of net zero emissions for its entire supply chain by 2030 and Microsoft has pledged to become carbon negative by 2030. Apple has committed to become carbon-neutral across its whole supply chain by 2030. They’re still falling short when it comes to delivering, but employee groups continue to push. Kari Paul Business For decades Exxon Mobil has arguably been corporate America’s biggest climate change denier. But this year, the activist investor Engine No 1 won three seats on the company’s board with an agenda to force the company to finally acknowledge and confront the climate crisis. Across corporate America and all around the world there are signs of change. The Federal Reserve, the world’s most powerful central bank, is beefing up its climate team. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has made environmental sustainability a core goal for the company. This isn’t about ideology: it’s about “common sense.” According to BlackRock, failure to tackle climate change is simply bad for business. The investor calculates that 58% of the US will suffer economic decline by 2060-2080 if nothing is done. Much more needs to be done, and some question whether corporate America can really solve this crisis without government action. But the days of denial are over – what matters now is action. Dom Rushe Electricity The rocketing global market price for gas has ripped through world economies, forcing factories to close, triggering blackouts in China, and threatening to cool the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. But it has also spelled out a clear economic case for governments to redouble their efforts in developing homegrown, low-carbon electricity systems. The good news is that renewable energy is ready to step up and play a greater role in electricity systems across the globe. The precipitous fall in the price of wind and solar energy has helped to incentivise fresh investments in electricity vehicles and energy storage technologies, such as batteries, where costs are plummeting too. Soon, wind and solar power will help to produce green hydrogen, which can be stored over long periods of time to generate electricity during days that are a little less bright or breezy. All of these advances are made possible by cheap renewables, and will help countries to use more renewable energy too. There has never been a better time to step back from gas and go green. Jillian Ambrose Buildings The built environment is one of our biggest polluters, responsible for about 40% of global carbon emissions. Over the past two decades, the carbon footprint of buildings “in use” has been greatly reduced by energy-saving technologies – better insulation, triple-glazing, and on-site renewables such as solar panels and ground-source heat pumps. Onheat pumps, the UK lags far behind: Norway, through a mixture of grants and high electricity prices, has installed more than 600 heat pumps for every 1,000 households. As national energy grids are decarbonising, the focus is shifting to reducing the “embodied energy” of materials – which can account for up to three-quarters of a building’s emissions over its lifespan – for example by reducing the amount of concrete and steel in favour of timber. There is also a growing movement to prioritise refurbishment and reuse over demolition, driven by the realisation that the most sustainable buildings are the ones that already exist. Oliver Wainwright Food and farming The hoofprint of the global livestock industry is a significant one, accounting for about 14% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. But it is increasingly recognised and accepted by national governments. New Zealand now has a legal commitment to reduce methane emissions from agriculture by 10% by 2030, while Denmark has passed a legally binding target to reduce climate emissions from the agricultural sector by 55% by 2030. While global meat production is increasing, there is a growing shift towards fish and poultry, which have a comparatively lower emissions footprint than red meats. The food industry is also developing a range of lower-carbon products using plant-based proteins such as soy and pea, and insect and lab-grown meat alternatives. Tom Levitt Manufacturing Decarbonising the manufacturing of every product needed by a modern economy is a vast and varied task. Some sectors are well on their way. For instance, Apple, the world’s third-largest maker of mobile phones by volume, has pledged to produce net zero carbon throughout its supply chain by 2030. For many others, advances in efficiency of factories and their products will be accelerated by machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies that are still in their infancy. There are even hopeful signs in some of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, such as plans by Volvo to replace coal with hydrogen in the steel it uses in cars. One of the greatest reasons for optimism is manufacturers’ increasing awareness of circular design principles. Making products easier to recycle from the start will help to cut emissions from fresh resource extraction– although a bigger question remains as to whether rich societies can reduce consumption, the most obvious way to cut emissions.

Morrison hailed Tuesday’s plan as a “practical way” to neutralise Australia’s emissions by 2050 but the plan showed almost a third of the abatement task is comprised of cuts via unspecified “technology breakthroughs” and “global trends” while a further 20% will be achieved through offsets. New energy department projections suggest Australia could reduce emissions by 30-35% by 2030 but following internal resistance from members of the National party – who are in a coalition with the conservative Liberal party – the federal government won’t change its formal 2030 target of a 26-28% cut compared to 2005 levels which was set in 2015. Australia’s emissions are among the highest in the world on a per capita basis and the country has long trailed behind similar developed countries in pledging to reduce emissions. The government has refused to release modelling underpinning the 2050 plan and is keeping details of the package – promised to secure Nationals support for the mid-century target – secret. The plan – which Morrison promoted as “the Australian way” – is underpinned by an updated technology roadmap that prioritises investment in clean hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions steel and aluminium and carbon capture and storage. It also adds ultra-low cost solar as a new priority. The overall investment totals $20bn, the government said. The Coalition claims this will unlock between $60bn and $100bn of additional investment from the private sector and the states – an upgrade to the $50bn forecast last year – and create 62,000 new regional mining and heavy industry jobs. As a result, gross national income will be 1.6% higher, and Australians would be nearly $2,000 better off on average in 2050 compared to a scenario where no action was taken. Modelling underpinning the projections would be released “eventually”, Morrison said. The prime minister also emphasised that the “technology not taxes” plan was based on existing government programs and would not require any new legislation, despite calls from Labor and independent MPs to enshrine the target in law. The focus of the plan was on bringing down the relative cost of low emissions technologies, which would result in an “accelerating deployment at scale across the economy”. Hydrogen, for example, has a production cost target of less than $2 a kilogram. “Our plan works with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it doesn’t legislate, it doesn’t mandate, it doesn’t force them. It respects them and understands that Australians want to do this … they want to protect their industries,” the prime minister said. The policy was based on “choices not mandates”, he said. Morrison conceded that at least 15% of the abatement task was based on “technology breakthroughs” in the future, saying this had been the experience of the modern world and no one could predict advances over the next 30 years. “The rate of technological advance is a given, it is actually a given in the modern world,” Morrison said. “To not think that is going to play a role over the next 30 years, that would be the more surprising assumption.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the 15% attributed to “established global technology trends” included technology such as low emissions cement and feed supplements that were in the “early days” of development. “This is not technologies we don’t necessarily know about. It may well be technologies that we know quite a lot about, but have not yet gotten to the point where we can make priority technologies,” Taylor said. Morrison said the additional 15% earmarked as coming from future “breakthroughs” would come from the “evolution and the momentum” of earlier technology developments. “That is what has happened time immemorial. That is probably one of the safest assumptions you can make, that the rapid escalation of technology will continue to drive these costs down.” A breakdown of the emissions reduction forecasts shows that the electricity sector will reduce its emissions by 96% by 2050, signalling the withdrawal of coal from the sector. Taylor said gas would still play a role in Australia’s electricity generation mix. The transport sector would achieve a 79% cut in emissions supported by battery charging and hydrogen refuelling stations as “enabling” infrastructure. Emissions from mining, industry and manufacturing would drop 54%, while in agriculture, the forecast is for a 40% cut. Labor blasted the proposal as a “scam” that lacked substance and criticised the government for its decision not to release details of the deal struck with the Nationals. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Morrison had outlined the “vibe” of a climate policy which had no new commitments. “We haven’t seen the modelling, and we haven’t had the detail. Because there is net zero modelling, net zero legislation and net zero unity,” Albanese said. “But in their own words, there is nothing new in this plan. The word plan doesn’t constitute a plan no matter how often he said and what form it’s printed. As always, with this prime minister, it is all about marketing. All about the spend, never about the substance.” The shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the only new element of the climate policy was “a pay rise for Keith Pitt” – in reference to the extra cabinet position secured by the Nationals. “They’ve introduced an emissions trading promotions policy. That’s all we’ve got.” Morrison said the agreement with the Nationals had resulted in the inclusion of a five-yearly review of the net zero target that would be undertaken by the Productivity Commission and a pledge to invest in the regions and to cut red tape. He said any other spending commitments made as part of the deal would be unveiled in the lead-up to the next election. “All of our policies will be announced before the election, in particular, there will be a budget next year,” Morrison said. After abandoning efforts to update Australia’s 2030 emissions target from the 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels, Morrison announced that the country was on track to achieve an actual reduction of between 30% and 35% on 2005 levels. This was attributed to the rapid take-up of rooftop solar, energy efficiency measures, and changes in land use. In question time on Tuesday, Morrison presented the government’s policy as one that was “based on choices, not mandates on the Australian people”. The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, went further, saying Labor’s policy was only about legislation. “Legislation brings in laws, and laws outlaw things, and laws enforce penalties, so we do have a clear differentiation, we have a chasm between the two different policies because we believe in inspiration and technology and they believe in laws and penalties.” Albanese is yet to detail Labor’s climate policy after it abandoned a previous target of a 45% reduction by 2030 after the last election. Labor is expected to unveil its new “ambitious” policy after the Glasgow summit, with Bowen saying it would be announced in “the coming weeks”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-25T08:06:43Z","webTitle":"Nationals MP Keith Pitt rejoins cabinet after climate deal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","fields":{"headline":"Nationals MP Keith Pitt rejoins cabinet after climate deal – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for this evening. Here’s a recap of today’s major stories: Boosters should be available six months on from last vaccine doses, Lt Gen John Frewen flagged today. Advice from Atagi is expected to come imminently. Victoria has reported 1,461 new Covid cases and, sadly, seven further deaths. Among them was a woman in her 20s. Over in NSW, the state has recorded 294 cases and four deaths as hundreds of students returned to school. Deputy prime minister and leader of the National party Barnaby Joyce has been on radio describing the net zero by 2050 target as a “goal”, not a commitment. Labor’s Chris Bowen today said the Coalition had been dragged “kicking and screaming” to the position a week before the Glasgow climate summit. Minister for resources and water Keith Pitt will be added to the cabinet, Scott Morrison announced, a day after the Nationals confirmed an in-principle support of net zero by 2050. Origin Energy have been slugged a record $5m in penalties after allegedly charging prohibited exit fees to more than 20,000 customers. And nearly one-third of refugees at Melbourne detention hotel have tested positive for Covid and one has been hospitalised. Former NSW education minister Adrian Piccoli is up on The Drum alongside Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor, discussing John Barilaro’s appearance at Icac hearings today. You can catch up on that here: Piccoli: In terms of the way government decisions get made about allocating resources, it’s pork-barrelling but it’s in somebody else’s electorate, when it’s in your electorate it’s about being a good local member. Tony Windsor and plenty of others were given lots of things in their electorates in order to carry their support with our independence, particularly in a minority government. Is that corrupt in itself? No. It’s not. It’s the political process. Taylor: I don’t think we can sit here and excuse pork-barrelling as being just the way that politics is done. Pork-barrelling means when there isn’t clear criteria and when it isn’t a transparent and clear process. And yes of course you might need a different set of criteria for say regional projects and the profitability of them in urban projects but you need criteria and a process, if you get to the point where pork-barrelling is normalised we are in a sorry state and it’ll erode trust in politics. That would be a terrible thing. Labor’s Marielle Smith has been quizzing PMC officials about Josh Frydenberg’s stay at the Lodge before the August sitting period. The treasurer told Sunrise in August that Morrison was “actually on the dishes, would you believe, because it’s just the two of us there”. PMC officials told Senate estimates that “there would have been household staff continuing to operate” because even in times the Lodge has been used to quarantine, staff have accessed the back of house through a zoning arrangement to keep them away from those quarantining. Smith also asked whether taxpayers were paying for food and drink, because Frydenberg had said “there’s enough bottles of ginger ale for us both to get one”. Officials said that as Frydenberg was there for two weeks there was no “cost recovery”, he didn’t pay his own way, and the tab was picked up by the department. For longer stays of non-dependent adults, the department seeks to recover costs. Officials couldn’t say whether MP Ben Morton had stayed there as they have “no visibility” of who stays at the Lodge. Australia is edging ever closer to 90% first vaccination doses among over 16-year-olds. Over in Tasmania, sonar imaging of the sea floor off the north-west coast has found no trace of a man or boat that went missing a week ago, AAP reports. Thomas Courto set off from the town of Wynyard around midday on 18 October with friends Isaiah Dixon and Bree-Anna Thomas in a yellow and white 17-foot motorboat. The bodies of Dixon and Thomas were found washed ashore at nearby Table Cape on Wednesday afternoon. Multi-beam sonar technology was used on Monday to comb an underwater area of roughly 340 hectares about three to four kilometres offshore. Inspector Steve Jones said there had been “no sighting” of Courto or the missing vessel, and said it wasn’t likely he’d be alive at this stage. Jones said air and sea search efforts would not occur on Tuesday, when a review into the week-long operation would be undertaken to determine if any spots had been missed. Searching may then resume on Wednesday. Courto’s family and friends continue to search coastline in the area and are still holding hope of finding him alive, Jones said. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is on ABC Melbourne now. He says Victoria will get “well over” 90% double-dose coverage in the coming weeks. Asked why Victoria is the only state with vaccination mandates to extend well into 2022, Andrews says: The protection you get from these vaccines is so clear cut, the fact this isn’t going away... the way to stay open, the way to stay as safe as possible is for people to get vaccinated... the evidence and steady climb in the numbers would make the case for me that having it mandated in certain settings has absolutely made people get vaccinated. Sometimes you need to be prompted, sometimes a bit of urgency comes when you have a date to work to. Meanwhile, Bridget McKenzie is speaking with ABC Melbourne on the National party’s support (in principle) of net zero emissions by 2050. She says the government has “made it clear” the targets won’t be legislated. On that note, I am going to hand you over to the lovely Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through the last part of the blog. Estimates continues and we will keep an eye on it, but the house is starting to wrap up. We will be back with Politics Live early tomorrow morning, but make sure you check back to see what the team have been working up for you today. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst for their never ending diligence and support. And to everyone else in the Guardian Australia brains trust who work overtime keeping this thing afloat (and all of us out of trouble. Well most of us. I’m always going to manage to find it) But the biggest thank you, as always, has to go to you for following along with us. It’s been a very strange year and it must feel a little weird as we all move on like the last two years weren’t completely life changing – I can assure you we feel it too and we are very aware of the load people are carrying. We’re all trying to find a balance at the moment, and there is no script for that. Find your own in your own way. Just try to be kind to those around you as we all stumble along. Have fun with Caitlin and take care of you. A good Monday evening to all and thanks to Amy Remeikis. I’ll be with you for the rest of the night. A thank you to the secret squirrels who are watching estimates so we don’t have to for passing on this gem – apparently the department of prime minister and cabinet spent $9,500 on consultants, who were hired to train up the people in PM&amp;C who train others on how to handle... estimates. So 10 grand on training the trainers, if you will, who then train senior executives on how to answer questions about their department. How does one train for estimates? Well, there is no scale of Penny Wong’s eyebrow raise for one. Also, no one plays specific senators during the mock hearings, there is apparently no list of senators to watch out for (one would think that is obvious anyway) and the training doesn’t teach people how to avoid answering questions. Apparently. So it remains unclear what they are taught. Because it is not as if we get a lot of answers during estimates anyway. We imagine it is probably pretty obvious not to wink at a minister during a hearing as well, so that probably doesn’t form part of the training either. Labor’s Kate Thwaites has seconded Josh Burn’s motion on the asylum seekers being held in the Parks Hotel: It is just not good enough that asylum seekers are still being held in unsafe and cruel conditions. In Melbourne asylum seekers are being held at the Park Hotel, where we now have a covid outbreak. At least one person has been taken to hospital. It’s not clear if the appropriate arrangements around infection control are in place to keep other people being detained safe. It is unacceptable the Morrison government is leaving people in an unsafe position during a global pandemic.” Remember that earlier post (it was many hours ago, so I don’t blame you if you don’t) about how Labor is starting the “stop pensioners from being added to the cashless debit card” campaign – now with Julian Hill’s private member’s bill (there is also a website, and petitions as this starts to whir up). Labor is also pushing for the card to be wound up, which is another part of Hill’s bill (and Luke Henriques-Gomes has been writing about the dubious evidence to support the card) but it is the pensioners part which is getting the most attention. Well, the minister Anne Ruston is not impressed: Labor are running a shameful scare campaign aimed at age pensioners based on blatant lies. Let me make it crystal clear - the Morrison government will not force age pensioners onto the cashless debit card. We were never going to, and never will. This government understands pensioners have worked hard to help build the Australia we live in today. That’s why I, as the social services minister, want to personally reassure all age pensioners of this. In fact, the government voted with the crossbench last year to support an amendment to legislation which explicitly ruled out ever forcing age pensioners on to the cashless debit card. But Labor opposed the amendment. Therefore, the bill the opposition has introduced today is simply an attempt at rewriting history. But Labor’s bill goes further and introduces a reckless plan to end a program that is helping unemployed Australians of working age stabilise their lives and their communities. Bizarrely, this plan was not put forward by Labor’s social services spokesperson Linda Burney who understands the complex challenges facing the communities where the program operates. It was put forward by backbenchers from Melbourne and Byron Bay who have not bothered to consult with the communities it will affect. Labor has clearly demonstrated they don’t care about supporting communities. They just care about playing politics, so much so they’ll simply lie to people and scare them into voting for them. Not sure if Burney will be pleased to see her name invoked here by the minister though, either. The federation chamber is about to debate a motion about refugees who are caught up in the Park Hotel covid outbreak. Ben Doherty has been covering that issue – you can catch up here Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Josh Burns are trying to make sure the plight of the refugees being held in the hotel – who are now fighting covid – gets more attention. Burns: In recent days we have learnt of a very serious Covid-19 outbreak at the Park Hotel in Melbourne – where 46 refugees are being held and where 20 have already tested positive. These are the remnants of the people who were transferred to Australia under the medevac arrangements. Ironically, they were brought here because they needed extra medical care. But due to the cruel choices by the government, their lives have been put at risk. And we must ask why. Why were they not released into the community when over 100 other medevac transfers were given a ticket into the community? The Minister for Defence said at the time, that it was cheaper to have people in the community, instead of detention. Yet, this Government chose to hold these 46 asylum seekers in the Park Hotel. And now almost half of them face a battle with the Delta variant. And the reports from this are not good – refugees have told advocates that when they first complained of symptoms, no isolation protocols were implemented, testing was delayed seemingly for weeks, and they were simply offered paracetamol. Because of this foreseeable failure we now have an active outbreak which was completely avoidable.” And Kearney (speaking on the ABC) This is a great travesty. We knew this was going to happen. I remember when I discovered that there were asylum seekers in a hotel in my electorate. One could see this was going to be a problem. I wrote to the then minister, I think it was Alan Tudge, and Andrew Giles wrote to the minister saying this is potentially a really big problem and we need to get them out of detention and into the community where it would have been safer for them. They have been moved to the Park Hotel. We’ve had the Delta strain and in three weeks, we have seen half the men affected or taken down by Covid. It is a tragedy that should never have happened. We don’t know what the conditions are in there. We know that guards are coming and going. We know that the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre told us that the men have said in there, that it is very difficult to get medical attention. They are testing their own oxygen levels in there. The nurse in me just absolutely starts to worry about that situation. I think the best thing that could happen is they were moved into the community and the government needs to take responsibility for this. Scott Morrison can’t palm this off to the state government. These men are his responsibility and he needs to make sure that they are treated carefully and that we protect the other men from what is happening in there. Senator Rex Patrick has been asking PMC officials about why they haven’t been releasing national cabinet documents after they lost an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case on the point of whether they are confidential. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, and John Reid, the first assistant secretary, answered that AAT decisions are decided on their own facts and are not equivalent to a court decision that has to be applied across the whole government as a matter of course. Labor’s Katy Gallagher is suspicious that government departments, including the health department, are still saying the documents are cabinet in confidence. Asked if PMC directed them how to respond to requests from the Covid committee, Foster replied that the government’s position that national cabinet is still a committee of the commonwealth cabinet isclear, including from legislation seeking to effectively overturn the decision and PMC evidence to an inquiry into that bill. Patrick complained that the government hadn’t even appealed the AAT loss. Foster replied a future case might be decided differently, and noted that since the case all state and territory leaders had reiterated that they expect confidentiality and solidarity, key features of a cabinet. It’s almost as if the government doesn’t want to appeal the case because a court decision stating conclusively that national cabinet isn’t a cabinet they would have to abide by, but a pesky AAT decision they can safely ignore. That interview between David Littleproud and Patricia Karvelas wraps up with this: Q: What’s the difference between an in principle agreement and a binding target? Which one is it? Littleproud: I think after tonight this will be a target that we are signing up to try and achieve by 2030. It is a goal that we’re on our way to do... PK: 2050. [I think you] misspoke. 2030, [is what] many people hope. Littleproud: Shoot me. It has been a long day, PK. Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) was also asked during Senate estimates about the impact of the closure of the Australian embassy in Afghanistan on its investigations into alleged war crimes. He said an embassy was not a prerequisite for mutual legal assistance, but noted: “We just can’t turn up in a country without the host state being aware of that.” But on the thorny issue of cooperation with Afghanistan, he observed: “At this stage I’m not sure we can do that.” (The Australian government has not formally recognised the Taliban-led government.) Moraitis said the OSI was following foreign affairs department’s work on that issue. He said securing evidence that could be admissible in a criminal case was “massively challenging at the best of times”. Moraitis was also asked to make clear that administrative actions considered by Defence (whether someone is terminated from the ADF, for example) are separate from the OSI investigations into criminal allegations. “Yes, Senator, I can absolutely confirm that. It’s separate … It’s not relevant to our work.” For more on that issue, see our recent story: Q: Just last Thursday Minister Pitt told question time “solar panels don’t work in the dark”. He repeated those comments today. Are you comfortable that a minister with this position is the best fit as Australia works to reach net zero emissions by 2050? David Littleproud: That’s childish politics. I mean, really? There are batteries that can come off them, but it doesn’t collect the solar energy when the sun is down. Pitt literally said those words. Here’s the Hansard from 21 October: I thank the honourable member for that question and say to them: find me a solar panel that works in the dark! This is just a statement of fact. It absolutely is. It is that simple. I say to those opposite: are you seriously suggesting that, when there is no sun, solar works? This is just a fundamental fact. He mentioned nothing about batteries, or storage. Just “find me a solar panel that works in the dark”. So Patricia Karvelas asks Littleproud: Who is the childish one? Littleproud: Really? Are we going to have a go at the - the question was asked about solar panels and the minister said, “Well, they don’t collect solar energy at night.” They’re stored in a battery. (He didn’t say that until today, after days of being ridiculed) That’s why people get sick of watching Question Time and the little antics like that. I think we should be better than that. That’s just silly semantics. “Silly semantics”. David ‘we are the first government to think of the future’ Littleproud is top and tailing the ABC today, appearing on Afternoon Briefing. He is asked about Keith Pitt’s return to the cabinet (which was part of the deal for the National party’s support for net zero emissions by 2050) Well, it was part of what we asked the prime minister to make sure that the resource sector is represented because the resource sector is part of the technology road map, representing 260,000 employees. We wanted to make sure that we were part of that and the prime minister saw that importance as you see the road map outlined in the coming day or days. The ONLY reason Pitt was removed from the cabinet in the first place, was because Barnaby Joyce all but booted him out in his return to the leadership, to make room for his own cabinet picks (including Bridget McKenzie) The Nats, under the secret Coalition agreement have a certain number of cabinet spots. Joyce didn’t have enough to reward his supporters, so he took Pitt out of the cabinet in order to make good on his promises when he became leader. So the only reason Pitt was removed, was Joyce wanted it that way. Mike Bowers also caught very happy Scott Morrison (as opposed to cranky answering questions Scott Morrison) Once again, Keith Pitt has only had his cabinet spot returned. He never lost his portfolio or spot in the ministry. He hasn’t cured world hunger. He didn’t even win his position in the party room battle over the bare minimum target of net zero emissions by 2050. He just gets to sit back in the cabinet room. Still, that didn’t stop the victory lap Oh, Joel Fitzgibbon is still bringing in books to be photographed with as a troll – today’s was the Latham diaries. During the Senate estimates hearing, Kristina Keneally asks Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) whether it is been able to exonerate any of the 19 current or former ADF personnel who were initially referred for investigation after the Brereton inquiry. Moraitis says it is “way too early” for that: “Senator, we have not exonerated anybody, we are starting our investigations to examine the evidence.” Keneally: When do you expect the investigations to conclude? Are we looking at a year, two years, five years? Moraitis: “Yes.” (He clarifies that “it could be anywhere in that range you’ve suggested”.) Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) has told an estimates hearing that more than 50 investigators and intelligence analysts are now on board. This is the body working with the AFP on investigations into allegations against Australian special forces soldiers who served in Afghanistan. He says they have a “clear focus on progressing as expeditiously as possible”. He said OSI has monitored recent events in Afghanistan (that’s the fall of the government and return of the Taliban) with concern. “To date our work has not been markedly impeded by the situation in Afghanistan.” He says the investigation teams are primarily focused on information from a variety of other sources at this stage. Sussan Ley, the environment minister who mostly makes the news for approving mines, finishes up this torturous question time with a dixer and we are then all allowed to stop watching parliament. In the meantime, this question from Linda Burney was important: Why did the prime minister fail to make every effort to properly consult Australian of the year, Grace Tame, on his national strategy to prevent child sexual abuse? Scott Morrison sends the question to Ben Morton, the special minister for state: Morton: The national strategy of development has been made possible by the incredible work and insights of those who have contributed to it, consultations have been made with the victim survivors and advocates, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disabilities in the Australian women’s commissions, in relation to the Australian of the year, in March the head of the national office for child safety had an informal meeting with Grace Tame in Canberra to discuss the national strategy ... the head of the National office of child safety emailed Grace Tame about how she might work [with] the office of child safety in relation to the strategy. On 13 May I spoke to Grace Tame to talk to her about measures in the budget to form part of the national strategy. And ... further the national office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to advise you of the national strategy commitment, it was to anticipate further activity of Grace Tame including her advocacy on these issues. And [emailed] the healing foundation on behalf of the national office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to invite to attend a consultation workspace on the 10 June on these issues for victim survivors, a follow-up email was sent. On 14 June, I personally travelled to Tasmania, with the head of the national office of child safety, to meet Grace Tame. The position and the role I take is Minister responsible for national office of child safety work I have done in relation to the national strategy was one that has been informed by Grace Tame’s meeting with her and engagement with our officials. I thank her for the insight onto those issues but the fact I had concerns and reservations about some of the elements of the strategy and Grace and I spoke about those and she actually assisted me in understanding the importance of them, that will be announced this week. On 20 October, the National office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to make sure she participates and invite her to the launch later this week. As a result of media discussions on this issue there has been further interaction with Grace Tame to make sure she can participate with other victim survivors in relation to the national strategy launch. Subsequently in relation to tweets from the leader of the opposition on Friday afternoon I reached up to his chief of staff to inform them of some of those engagements with Grace Tame. In relation to the national strategy is an important issue and victim survivors deserve to be above politics. The government wins the divisions, so we move on. Barnaby Joyce tries and fails to answer another question, and then we move through some very painful dixers (honestly, just use a press release) before Anthony Albanese moves to suspend standing orders to debate this motion: that the House of Representatives supports a legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050 (The transcription service called that SARAH emissions. It also mislabelled a minister’s title as ‘minister for testicles’ so it is having a small moment today. Question time may have finally broken Tveeder) The government opposes the suspension of standing orders. Vince Connolly, the member for the soon-to-be-no-more electorate of Stirling, is taking every opportunity he can to audition for his role if he doesn’t win a WA seat at the next election (he could be the candidate for Cowan) – a human who absolutely knows how to talk to people. We believe in the member for Stirling. Sure, he still delivers dixers like he is a bunch of raccoons sewn into a suit, but one day, he’s going to ask a question like a normal person and then we’ll know – he’s ready. Scott Morrison was cranky again on a question on climate. Moving on. Just for the record, the deputy Nationals leader also dropped this brain fart into question time today: We are the first government to think about the future. Sure Jan. An interesting exchange during Senate estimates. James Paterson – who is chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS) – asked Asio chief Mike Burgess about Anthony Byrne, the Labor MP who recently resigned as deputy chair. Paterson told the hearing Byrne had resigned as a result of “internal party matters that I don’t seek to comment on and I know you won’t seek to comment on either”. Paterson told the Senate estimates hearing: “But during that public discussion it was suggested that a reason that he may need to resign from the committee was because intelligence and security agencies could no longer trust him, given his disclosures before Ibac.” Paterson then asked Burgess whether he held any of those concerns. Burgess told the hearing he generally did not comment about individuals, but added that he had engaged with Byrne extensively over the past few years, both as Australian Signals Directorate head and now as the head of Asio. “And in that capacity, I found him to be someone who is deeply thoughtful and probing in his understanding of intelligence and security matters, the threats we face and actually what’s needed to protect our country from these threats whilst upholding the law of this land. So, I’ve no doubt I would assess that Mr Byrne is someone who cares deeply about national security, and what’s in Australia’s national interests.” Burgess then proceeded to make a general comment that “if I had concerns about a member of parliament” he “would talk to the leader of the party”. Keith Pitt, now looking like a terrier who might be offered a piece of nana’s steak if they can just manage not to bark and ruin Sunday lunch, has put out his own statement about his return to the cabinet. (Barnaby Joyce, who booted him from the cabinet, made sure the cameras were watching as he walked over and shook his hand, because apparently, the floor of the parliament was the only chance he had). Pitt’s statement (a reminder that Pitt never lost his job, or his portfolio – just his spot around the cabinet table): “Today the Prime Minister appointed me to Cabinet as the Minister for Resources and Water. “I thank him for that privilege. “My focus will continue to be on the hundreds of thousands of men and women across Australia who make such a significant contribution to the resources and water sectors. “The resources industry directly employs more than 260,000 Australians, mainly in regional areas, and is forecast to hit a record $349 billion in exports this financial year. “It supports the jobs of another 1.2 million Australians. “Our resources remain in high demand throughout the world and will support Australian jobs and economic growth for decades to come. “I am also committed to building stronger regional communities across the Murray-Darling Basin. “Good rain combined with good management and best practice by our farmers and irrigators are delivering record crops across many parts of the Basin this year. “In Cabinet, I will continue to support them with policies that support all Basin communities.” Alan Tudge sprouts some more rubbish about the changes to the curriculum. The things he says are not only factually wrong, they are also just sad, transparent attempts to start a culture war in a bid for some actual relevance. Libby Coker to Barnaby Joyce: “I refer to his comments in this House last week concerning net zero. Did the deputy prime minister yesterday oppose a policy of net zero emissions by 2050?” Joyce: I thank the honourable member for her question, and right from the start say I want 100% support our process of going to Glasgow, for the target of net zero emissions. I do that because I have laid out the process of how the National Party were deliberate about this, I clearly laid out the process that was never given to other people in the regional member for the Labor Party, and that process was that opposition would not be determined by the executive, it would not be determined by one person, it would be determined by the views of party members and yesterday they did precisely that. We are going forward as a Coalition government to make sure we do the best. It is really important that we got to that position and I tell you why. Because there is a difference in policy, we believe in technology, they believe in legislation. They believe in laws, we believe in technology. (Barnaby Joyce, as a member of the executive government, writes the laws. That is his job). They believe in legislation, because legislation outsourced things, and they are going to be the greatest outlaws since Ned Kelly, they will outlaw central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, the coal industry, they will outlaw the miners because they have said they are coming forward with legislation, that is your policy. (He then starts an argument with Anthony Albanese from the despatch box). You are saying you’re not going to legislate? Tony Smith: “I will caution the deputy prime minister. We have done this a few times, ministers are not going to, no you haven’t got your microphone on, you need to wait. The deputy prime minister will not ask questions, he will bring himself to the question that was asked, that he is already straying from. Joyce: For the sake of the House, for the sake of the honourable member opposite, the issue is resolved. Albanese then seeks leave to answer the question, but Peter Dutton does not grant it. The head of Asio says the intelligence agency “would not let it rest if we saw a nation state engaged in acts of misinformation or disinformation” – including during an election campaign. Mike Burgess said he would have a conversation with the electoral commissioner and the prime minister and the opposition leader if such activity was detected during a campaign, but it would depend on the nature of the problem. Labor’s Kristina Keneally asked Burgess about the issue of disinformation being used as a tool of state-backed foreign interference, which she noted had been reported as affecting a number of democratic elections in other jurisdictions. Burgess said: Have we seen nation states lining up issues in an attempt to provide disinformation on certain topics? Yes, we have seen that. Do we expect that before an election? Maybe. We’ll continue to watch that, with other agencies and put out the appropriate advice at the time. I think there’s something wonderful though about our democracy. [It] allows information and disinformation to be debated and challenged openly so I think there is a good defence there. I think our democracy is fairly robust in that regard, but of course we wouldn’t let it rest, the community would not let it rest if we saw a nation state engaged in acts of misinformation or disinformation. That would be drawn to the government’s attention and during caretaker be drawn to both parties’ attention. Mike Burgess, the Asio chief, is giving evidence to Senate estimates now. He says each day, “multiple countries are making multiple attempts” to conduct espionage and foreign interference against Australia. Such activity is enabled and accelerated by technology, he says, adding those attempts are targeting all levels of government and industry and academia. On terrorism, Burgess says religiously motivated violent extremists continue to continue to urge attacks. He notes investigations into ideologically motivated violent extremism have increased. While he says there has been considerable and understandable attention given to nationalist and racist violent extremism, Australia is also seeing growth in single-issue motivated groups and individuals that have the potential to embrace violence. Burgess points to recent anti-lockdown protests “where some adopted violence as a tactic”. Meanwhile. Madeleine King to Scott Morrison: “Given his previous statements that electric vehicles and renewable energy targets are nuts and the world’s biggest battery store of renewable energy was as useful as a big banana and a big prawn, how can Australians trust the prime minister to deliver action on climate change?” Scott Morrison (continuing to rewrite history, which is what happens when you use marketing slogans and glib one-liners off the cuff as policy, and then actually have to come up with policy): I opposed Labor policies, I opposed their approach to the issues you are referring to, I didn’t agree with the way they wanted to do that, and the Australian people agreed with me. The approach that the Labor party was seeking to take at the last election on those matters was not an approach I agreed with. We had policies that were supporting electric vehicles and renewable technologies, all of those things, at the last election and the Australian people supported those policies. We want to keep doing that because under our policies, we want to see more and more investment going into these areas and that’s what we are trying to change and ...mandate so they can invest in these important technologies. There are $192m support for low emissions technologies, including $72m to support electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicle charging infrastructure, $52m for regional Australia, $20m to make heavy trucks more fuel efficient and more to help heavy industry reduce their energy consumption. That is what we are trying to do. The Labor Party are voting against all of those things for supporting the disallowance motion which would prevent us from on those renewable technologies, in particular, on electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicle charging infrastructure. So, I’m not going to [support] the policies of the Labor party, whose policies were rejected at the election because they were carried away with the fantasies, and the Australian people caught them out ... That’s what they are not going to pay for and the Labor party is still in the same place, they still haven’t thought the policies through haven’t prepared a plan for how to achieve the targets, they don’t have a 2030 target, and they are going to the Australian people and saying just trust us? Who would trust the Labor party with the economy, to take Australia through one of the biggest changes in the global economy which has been for at least a generation if not 50 years. The Labor party cannot be trusted to manage the economy through this major change ... Our policies will set out very clear plans, there will be technology, there won’t be taxes, respect for people’s choices, we won’t be mandating what they should buy and where they should buy it. We will let Australians make their own mind up because we trust Australians to make good choices in their interests, they will have lower taxes to pay for them, courtesy of the treasurer. You cannot trust Labor on their climate policies. Angus Taylor sprouts something about technology not taxes. Next. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: “My question is to the prime minister and refers to his previous answer in which he said he would release his plan soon enough. The minister for regionalisation has said in regard to what the government does to make good a deal on net zero ‘the first rule of fight club is not to talk about fight club’. “Don’t Australians deserve more respect than this? Apart from a pay rise for the minister ... what is Australia’s climate policy, and why don’t the Australian people have a right to know?” (Most question times these days seem to have some inclusion of something ridiculous Bridget McKenzie has said). Morrison: They have every right to know and we set out very clearly at the last election ... and as a result, emissions reductions, Mr Speaker, emissions reductions have fallen by 20% on 2005 levels. I said we would meet and beat our 2030 target Mr Speaker, and we will, and I’m looking forward to setting that out, Mr Speaker, at the Glasgow Cop26, where we will set out clearly our commitments in terms of 2050 as well as ... our commitments in relation to 2030, which we took to the last election. At the last election, there was one issue. There was a question of 45% emissions reduction, put forward by the Labor party, and 26-28% was put forward by the Liberal National party, Mr Speaker. That is what we took to the last election. The people rejected a Labor policy because Labor could not expand the policies. No plan to achieve their policies. They couldn’t say what they cost. And, Mr Speaker, nothing has changed since that time. They still don’t have a plan, as to how they will meet their targets. They don’t even have a target for 2030, Mr Speaker. I recall when the government first came to be elected, we made very clear in 2013 that we would commit to the 2020 targets. That was, Mr Speaker, that was seven years from that date, we are eight years from 2030 and the opposition can’t even make a commitment about a 2030 target. Not only do we make that commitment before we were elected, we met that commitment and we beat that commitment. ... I said very clearly, Mr Speaker, that the government I lead was not going to support a net zero by 2050 target unless we could detail a plan to achieve it. Mr Speaker, those opposite scoff at this. What they don’t understand, Mr Speaker, is that people in rural ... Australia across the country deserve that. They deserve to know what the plan is, how it impacts them, and how we’re going to achieve it. Mr Speaker, that is what we will be setting out very, very clearly. ... And we will be very faithful to the commitments we made at the last election ... Those opposite could not expand their policies. We could. That is why Australians can trust the Liberals and the Nationals with an economic plan that enables us to meet our emissions reductions targets. They know that a party, both parties and our coalition, which, Mr Speaker, have rightly wrestled with this issue ... considered carefully the implications of the costs and the issues that will need to be dealt with. Greg Hunt says some things but people seem to pay even less attention than usual, which really says it all. The only person who seems to hold people’s attention less these days is Angus Taylor. Thank goodness for merit, huh? Anthony Albanese decides to ask the prime minister a question: Now that the prime minister supports Labor’s policy of net zero emissions by 2050, will he also support Labor’s policy to legislate net zero emissions by 2050? Scott Morrison is so cranky he begins to lose his voice answering this one. (He also gets a bit more personal, as he seems to work out some internal frustrations – which may actually just be a projection of who he is really cranky at, but can’t publicly yell at, because Coalition unity). Morrison: The Coalition does not support Labor’s policy. The Labor party have a target with no plan, Mr Speaker. They have a target with no plan. That is not the Coalition policy. The policy of the Coalition is to have a plan with a target. So people actually know what we plan to do to achieve the target that they want to achieve. Mr Speaker, we have been working through carefully, considering all of the implications. I also have a plan of how I am going to transition to removing chocolate from my diet by the year 2050, which involves changing nothing, but talking about how I am absolutely going to do it. Albanese interjects with how Morrison should release the plan. Morrison says “soon enough” in the same sort of voice my parents used to use when I would ask when my curfew would be lifted. Morrison continues: The Australian people will know our plan, Mr Speaker, but they won’t know the Labor party’s plan. They won’t know the Labor party’s plan because despite having said that they want to achieve net zero by 2050, Mr Speaker, for some years now, there is still no plan as to how they will achieve it, no estimate of what it will cost. Mr Speaker, Labor does not even have a 2030 target let alone having a plan for how they will achieve their 2050 target. But what the Australian people know is the same genius on the Labor’s side who came up, Mr Speaker, with the retirees’ tax, the housing tax, and the superannuation tax, the same genius that came up with all of those economy destroying policies is the same genius that the leader of the Labor party was relying on for the Labor party to achieve a 2050 net zero outcome. The only net zero outcome that will come from the Labor party, Mr Speaker, is what will happen to the Australian people and their prosperity, Mr Speaker, because you cannot trust Labor with an economic plan to deliver on a net zero 2050 target. Mr Speaker, our plan is clear, Mr Speaker. Technology, not taxes. (No one is suggesting taxes). We won’t be mandating or shutting down industries, Mr Speaker. We will let people make their own choices. We’ll make sure there is a portfolio of technologies that we can bring to scale, Mr Speaker, and bring to affordability, backed up by backing to make any balance right between affordable, reliable power, Mr Speaker, and ensuring that we are achieving the lower emissions outcomes that we are seeking. And we will be absolutely transparent about that because that is one of the things that the Australian government has delivered year in year out on being fully transparent about our emissions reductions. ... Labor have no plan for their target. They have signed up Australia and they want to put it in law and they can’t even tell Australians how they will do it or how much it will cost. It is just a rerun of Bill 2.0. (When Morrison gets personal, and tries out these lines, you know he is getting frustrated). Josh Frydenberg has once again forgotten how to use microphones. Moving on Adam Bandt manages to make Scott Morrison, who is once again being sidelined by Labor to prove a point (that he has no impact on his policy), very cranky with this question: The Glasgow summit is demanding the whole world commits to climate targets before it is too late to stop runaway global warming. It is easy to beat the terrible target set by Tony Abbott. The UK and US have lifted their targets with a 68% cut. Prime minister, why won’t you beat and better the UK and US targets, with 75% target determined by the independent emissions panel. And condemn Australia to severe floods, droughts and rising temperatures. Morrison is very cranky as he answers this: I don’t know why the member for Melbourne wants to talk down about regional and rural areas. They have seen emissions drop by 20.5%, more than New Zealand, more than the United States, more than many countries around the world ... Australian farmers and those in rural and regional Australia do the heavy lifting, I think they should expect this place to respect them. They should respect their efforts and they should respect their contributions, but I think Australians are growing ... tired of the Greens, and joined also by those opposite from time to time, talking down rural and regional Australia and their contributions to ensuring their environments and their communities are stronger, and their way of life is protected. The targets that I took to the last election, the targets that I took the last election, were endorsed by the Australian people! They rejected the targets put forward by the Labor party and the Greens, they rejected them, they endorsed our targets and I said we would meet and beat those targets and indeed we will! We will keep faith with the Australian people on the things we pledged at the last election and we will exceed their expectations on what those targets were set out at the last election. The Australian people are doing the heavy lifting. Australia has the highest rate of solar on roofs of any country in the world, last year. We had more renewable investment in this country in one year [than Labor’s government]. Our rate of growth in renewable investment is outstripping countries around the world, our low emissions technology roadmap is making sure hydrogen and other important fuels and opportunities are being realised all around the country. The leader of the Greens needs to understand it is performance that counts, not the empty aspirations. And what Australia can point to as a track record of delivering, a 20% reduction in emissions at the same time as Australia has achieved 40% increase in the size of our economy. I’d like to see another country match that. ... We are carrying our weight and making a contribution and we won’t be told by people outside this country how we should be meeting our targets. Chris Bowen to Keith Pitt (who now looks like if his chest puffed out any further, he would float into space): “Does he agree with the New South Wales treasurer who said yesterday we have some of the best renewable resources anywhere on the planet, those renewable energy resources can be used to create and support heavy industry create green aluminium and steel and provide the world’s energy needs in a low carbon future?” Pitt: Mr Speaker, I will be very frank. I am not interested in what the New South Wales treasurer has to say – my job is to deliver for the resources sector, to look after the water interests of all Australians as we saw with the Murray-Darling basin continuing to have the right balance, to make exports ... while there are markets for our products we will fill them. Those opposite want to close sections down and close industry down, close the resources sector down. On this side of the chamber we will continue to support the sector. The current deputy prime minister took a dixer which seems to be an opportunity to spend time talking about [most likely] incoming Country Liberal Party senator Jacinda Price (who won the top NT CLP senate spot from Sam McMahon) That is most likely because he backed McMahon in the senate battle – and there is nothing stopping Price from sitting in the Liberal party room (like the LNP, the CLP can choose which party room they sit in) which would mean he faces losing another vote. He has already lost George Christensen – and Colin Boyce the candidate replacing him, is no guarantee to be a Joyce backer. So that is a potential loss of two numbers in the Nats party room already – and it’s never a particularly loyal group anyway. Labor’s Warren Snowden gets booted out for interjecting with “donkey’s brain” Anthony Albanese to Keith Pitt (who is still shaking like a terrier faced with a Schmacko): “Last week the minister told question time ‘find me a solar panel that works in the dark’. Is the minister aware that batteries can store renewable energy? Does the minister get a shock when he turns on the tap and water comes out even though it is not raining outside?” Pitt: I thought they brought the out the big guns, but they brought the pop gun. The leader of opposition has said the thing I backed up, solar panels don’t work in the dark, that is just a fact. If you want to store energy you can do it and in any number of ways. It is the resources sector delivering the technology and resources to make those things a reality. Scott Morrison continues to take credit for the vaccination program and Covid recovery like that guy who never turned up for your group assignment, but arrived in time for the presentation, presenting it like it was all their own work. We are straight into it, with Pat Conroy taking on Keith Pitt (Pitt arrived early for QT, spread out his papers and tried his best not too look too excited – which he failed at. Pitt has been pretty sad since he was booted from cabinet – this is all his dreams come true). Conroy asks if Pitt can confirm he gave away his opposition to net zero for a chance to get back into cabinet: “Why is it about about your job and not regional jobs?” Pitt: They [Labor] are all about digging up dirt but not the way the resources sector does. (It’s not exactly digging up dirt – it was announced). It is all about politics with those opposite. The hardworking men and women, Mr Speaker, out there turning over dirt (machines do this now), shipping coal, shipping iron ore, driving jobs and driving our economy. Mr Speaker, those opposite will continue this line of questioning, but I can say that every day I get up and am on a role in the government, I am looking to deliver for regional Australia, our country, for individuals that we represent who are out there working hard, paying their taxes, taxes which are much lower under this the government than they would be under the opposition, I will say, Mr Speaker. We will continue to deliver for them because it is about them. Now Anthony Albanese is up – he is saying the coming election is about two very different outcomes for Australia. (Which is the outcome of every election). It is time for 90 second statements in the House (where MPs can speak about anything they like before question time). So it is time to play who is that MP – retiring LNP MP Ken O’Dowd. The Nationals wanted to add another title to Keith Pitt’s portfolio covering “managing the transition in regional communities”, which was denied by the PM. Scott Morrison has made this announcement: “Today I announce the Minister for Resources and Water the Hon Keith Pitt MP will be added to the Cabinet. “Minister Pitt is a powerful voice for the resources sector and ensuring that we build upon Australia’s strength in traditional exports, while harnessing opportunities in the new energy economy and critical minerals. “Minister Pitt has been a strong advocate for regional and rural communities, both in his portfolio responsibilities and as a local MP, and will work closely with the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction the Hon Angus Taylor MP to ensure we reach our emissions reduction targets through technology that will empower our industries and regional communities. “Only the Coalition can be trusted to grow our economy, maintain affordable and reliable energy prices, protect our resource industries and manufacturing base that supports rural and regional communities, and take practical and responsible action to achieve our emissions reduction targets.” Labor’s Chris Bowen has stood up to respond to the government’s deal on net zero, saying the Coalition had been dragged “kicking and screaming” to the position a week before the Glasgow climate summit. He accused the government of being a “rolling rumble of chaos and secrecy”, highlighting Joyce’s opposition to the net zero goal, and the lack of transparency around the deal that has been struck between the two parties which will include a new cabinet position. Bowen said the net zero target needed to be legislated, and the government should update its medium term emissions reduction target. “Australia under Scott Morrison is desperately playing catch up.” He said the Labor party would outline its medium term emission reduction targets in the coming weeks after the Glasgow summit had concluded. “The Australian people will have a choice: a party which doesn’t really believe in net zero by 2050, there’s no plan to get there and it’s all about the politics, or an alternative government, which believes passionately that the world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity,” Bowen said. “The most important thing is to ensure that Australia has a government which believes in the path forward and has the policies in place to ensure that job creation goes hand in hand with emissions reduction, emissions down, jobs up, energy prices down.” Bowen said he was prepared for an “inevitable” scare campaign on Labor’s targets, once they were updated. “I believe Labor can win the next election with a good and ambitious climate policy, one which is anchored in good economics in jobs across the regions of Australia,” he said. “And I believe we can repel the inevitable scare campaign.” Labor’s Penny Wong has asked Simon Birmingham about when Scott Morrison first found out about the entity that partly paid for Christian Porter’s legal fees. Birmingham said: “To my knowledge, when the disclosure was made.” Birmingham said he believes Porter updated his personal information declaration to Morrison on the same day as the MPs’ pecuniary interest register. Wong said it was extraordinary that the prime minister did not have any advanced warning. Birmingham said he would confirm the answer and report back if there was “any variance” with the evidence he’d given. John Reid, first assistant secretary, said the department first found out in a phone call to him from a senior adviser in the PMO on 14 September, the day the news broke of Porter’s disclosure of the Legal Services Trust. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, said the department was asked “whether or how an arrangement such as that could be compliant with the ministerial standards”. But no conclusion was reached before Porter resigned from the ministry. Earlier, Foster answered a question about the PMC department discussing the Porter issue with the PMO between 15 and 19 September. Wong then drew Foster’s attention to vision of her appearing to wink at Birmingham when she gave this evidence: Foster said at no time did she intentionally wink at Birmingham. You be the judge! Over at energy estimates, we’ve just broken for lunch. We haven’t learnt a great deal more from this morning’s sessions but it’s worth mentioning that the hearing had to break for about 15 minutes a little while ago to deal with the issue that departmental officials were not answering questions. This has been the case more or less all morning, with officials refusing on multiple occasions to take questions relating to the Glasgow talks and climate policy due to cabinet confidentiality, or, where questions related to Australia’s climate modelling, because of a claim made by the energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor for public interest immunity. The specific issue at hand that led to the suspension was a question asked by Labor senator Nita Green about the Nationals’ proposed $250bn loan facility for the resources sector. Officials said they could not answer because this was not the relevant hearing in which to ask it – the relevant time would be the resources portfolio on Thursday. Some heated debate ensued with Labor, the Greens and the independent senator Rex Patrick all arguing officials had an obligation to answer questions. The hearing was suspended to deal with it. It was ultimately agreed officials should take a question about whether energy officials had provided any advice to the resources minister, Keith Pitt, about a $250bn coal loan facility. The department said the answer to that question was no. It is almost time for question time. Expect a repeat of what we are not hearing in estimates. Labor’s Penny Wong is asking the government Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, about a UK Telegraph report that Australian government sources described the UK high commissioner, Vicki Treadell, as a “sanctimonious bore” who was “haranguing” Australia about climate. Birmingham said he is “not accepting the proposition” that anyone in the government said that, because it is an unattributed quote. But he said “of course if someone were to have said that, the prime minister would condemn it” because Scott Morrison values the close relationship with the UK and its high commissioner. Earlier, James Larsen, the climate coordinator in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, confirmed that Morrison had indicated he would go to Glasgow Cop26 climate conference on 15 October, the last day for registration. Wong was annoyed at Larsen for not being able to reveal who is travelling to the conference, besides Morrison and the energy minister Angus Taylor. Larsen said he couldn’t recall which MPs were going, but confirmed Warren Entsch was among them when prompted by Wong. Wong asked him to get the draft list he had seen. And in environment estimates there is one piece of information we have learned. We don’t know what the Nationals have received, what the climate deal is, or what it will cost, but we do know that there is an advertising plan coming! Under questioning from Labor’s Nita Green, the environment boffins have conceded there will be a $13m marketing plan on the climate policy, including market research – which you should start seeing from this week. Back in the house (the Senate is all estimates-focused this week) and Adam Bandt has reintroduced the Greens’ coal prohibition bill. Here was part of his speech: We need to do what we have done in other industries that we know don’t have a sustainable future. It is not the fault of the workers or communities in coalmining towns or towns associated with coal-fired power stations. They have worked to help us keep the lights on and to power this country for decades. These communities should be in charge of their own future. They should be provided with the support, expertise and financial resources they need to transform and diversify their local economies in the way that they choose, so that their children can have stable, good-quality jobs in the new global economy. If we don’t stop mining and burning coal, we will be extinguished. If we don’t start now, before the change is thrust upon us, we will see deep, localised recessions and dismantled communities. This is a bill whose time has come. We need to join the rest of the world in making a plan to get out of coal and gas. We don’t have a minute to lose. The Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs committee has heard details of the Australian federal police’s investigation into the Leppington Triangle land purchase. Last month the AFP said it had finalised its investigation into the commonwealth’s purchase of land for the development of the Western Sydney airport, “with no evidence of criminal conduct identified”. During the AFP’s appearance before a Senate estimates hearing this morning, the committee heard that 11 investigators had been involved in the Leppington investigation. The Queensland LNP senator Gerard Rennick asked what evidence had been provided by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) as part of the investigation. The AFP deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, told the Senate committee: The original referral matter indicated that fraud may have occurred and subsequent to that the auditor general provided a significant amount of digital material to the AFP as part of the investigation ... It was a range of documents in terms of financial transactions, valuation agreements, a range of documents related to the transaction. Rennick: “And no evidence was found of any wrongdoing?” McCartney: “We have put out a statement saying we identified no criminal wrongdoing in relation to the matter, senator.” Rennick: “So do you know why, if there was no evidence of any wrongdoing … why the auditor general would think there was evidence of wrongdoing?” McCartney: Well I think you’d have to ask the auditor general, but in the letter he provided to Australian federal police he indicated the suspicion of fraud in relation to the transaction. We received that matter, we decided to undertake an investigation, and as a result of that investigation we haven’t found criminal offending in relation to the matter, senator. Rennick: “Did you have to conduct raids on the the staff’s houses to get all possible records?” McCartney: I think we’ve said before at Senate estimates [that] we don’t conduct raids, we conduct search warrants. We conducted two search warrants, but I’m not prepared to say in terms of the open hearing what they related to, senator. Rennick made a general statement that included the question: “Where’s the accountability with the auditor general?” (The ANAO is due to face Senate estimates tonight.) The hearing continues. Labor’s Tony Burke sought to suspend standing orders to move a motion relitigating the issue of the House failing to refer Christian Porter’s legal fees being part-paid by a trust with funds from unknown sources to the privileges committee. The government moved that Burke no longer be heard, and won the vote, so he didn’t get further than the attempted suspension. A copy of the motion, seen by Guardian Australia, indicates that Burke was seeking to move that the House note: Last week, the Morrison-Joyce government voted down a privileges motion given precedence by the speaker for the first time since federation; media reports that ‘Liberal backbenchers were completely horrified’ by that vote, which protected the member for Pearce from having to disclose the sources of donations; this renders the register of members’ interests completely meaningless; and those same backbenchers now have the chance to put things right and restore basic standards of transparency and integrity to this parliament. It also sought leave for Burke to move once against to refer Porter to privileges. But Burke didn’t get that far. So, another vote on government members’ record refusing to refer the Legal Services Trust issue to the privileges committee. Over in energy estimates, senators have been putting pressure on the department about Australia’s 2030 targets. Remember that for all the government’s focus on 2050, it is 2030 targets and urgent cuts to emissions in the next decade that are the focus of the Glasgow climate talks. My colleagues flagged in this piece last week that there was no appetite in the government to take a stronger 2030 target to next week’s summit. There have been some confusing exchanges about Australia’s 2030 plans during this morning’s hearing, with department officials seemingly unwilling to confirm if updating the target had been ruled out. But that now appears to have been confirmed in this exchange between the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Jo Evans, a deputy secretary in the department of industry, science, energy and resources department. Hanson-Young: The NDC (nationally determined contribution) does require commitment, doesn’t it? Not just aspiration. Evans: Well we have already taken that and there is a commitment in our existing NDC and that is the target that has already been communicated. Hanson-Young: The Tony Abbott target? Evans: The target of the Australian government that was set under Paris in 2015. Hanson-Young: So that won’t change? Evans: That target, which was set at 2015 and which is for 2030, is not changing. Nationals MP Anne Webster has lodged a private member’s bill to regulate social media companies. The bill gives the communications minister power to “make determinations about the basic expectations of a social media service”. These can then be followed up by the eSafety commissioner, which can demand social media companies report on how they’re meeting the expectations or publish their own conclusions about contraventions. The bill also creates a process for members of the public to complain to the eSafety commissioner about defamatory material on social media platforms. According to the explanatory memorandum: The commissioner [has] the power to issue defamation notices to a service provider in circumstances where a complaint regarding defamatory material has been made to the commissioner, and the commissioner is satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the material defamed or defames the complainant ... Service providers can be liable for defamation if that service provider is issued with a defamation notice by the commissioner and the defamatory material is not removed within 48 hours. Webster as been at the forefront of efforts to hold social media giants liable as publishers after successful defamation proceedings against a conspiracy theorist who used Facebook to call her “a member of a secretive paedophile network”. Labor MP Julian Hill has also introduced this bill (as a private member’s bill) which aims to “Protect Pensioners from the Cashless Debit Card Bill”. This has been a campaign Labor has been ticking away at in key electorates for the last couple of months. The thing is, there is no plan to put pensioners on the cashless debit card. The government has been ruling that out for months – but don’t be surprised if this starts to play out as part of an election campaign (much like the fake death-tax campaign run against Labor at the last campaign had an impact, and Mediscare had an impact before that). Over in the house, Tony Burke has attempted to suspend standing orders but that has been gagged very quickly by the government and the procedures move on. Earlier today, New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet welcomed the return to school for hundreds of thousands of students, and said the government was “always revisiting” its reopening plans. His comments came after he was asked about his counterpart in Victoria, Daniel Andrews, announcing eased restrictions from Friday, and again from 24 November. Perrottet said the Covid and Economic Recover Committee revisited the state’s restrictions each week, with changes due on 1 November and 1 December. He said: There’s a sense of positivity and confidence we haven’t seen for sometime. What we need to do is have that strong health response, which we’ve made some substantial investments in, but then ultimately open up as safely as possible so we get [people] back into work and provide for their families. We’ve always had a balanced and measured approach here in NSW. We’ll continue to have that approach as we move forward. Perrottet was asked if the state had “dodged a bullet” considering it had avoided forecasts of cases and hospitalisations spiking in October. He said: This pandemic is not over. We are opening up and as we open up, case numbers will increase and hospitalisations will increase. I think it’s a long journey. The success here has been our vaccination rate, and we’ll obviously continue to look at the data as it comes through. All school students returned to face-to-face learning today, after years 1, 12 and kindergarten returned last week. State education minister Sarah Mitchell announced school sport would resume from 1 November. Sixteen schools across NSW are closed today for cleaning and contact tracing, after members of their school communities tested positive. The head of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission says the recently released Pandora Papers only confirms the group’s past findings about the risks posed by offshore service providers. The Greens senator Nick McKim pointed to a 2017 ACIC report that said serious and organised crime groups “engage the services of professional facilitators to launder the proceeds of crime, conceal illicit wealth and enhance their criminal activities”. The report said: As seen with the release of the so called Panama Papers in April 2016, criminal groups may employ offshore service providers to conceal their illicit funds. Michael Phelan, the ACIC chief executive, told Senate estimates today: I think with the release of the Pandora Papers and what we know about them … all it does is confirm the original assessments that were made in 2017 that offshore enablers does cause us a problem, both from a revenue protection position in terms of our tax revenue but also potential money laundering and obfuscating of funds that may well have been derived illicitly from activities in Australia. Phelan said the assessment in 2017 “has been confirmed”. He said he “wouldn’t necessarily say we are a favoured destination for money laundering”, adding: “Generally the money goes the other way.” I would not say that Australia is a popular destination for laundered funds - popular in a sense of relativity, senator … So if I was going to hide my money it would be in an offshore tax haven, it certainly wouldn’t be here. McKim pursued the issue of including professional facilitators – such as accountants, lawyers and real estate agents – within the scope of money laundering laws. Phelan said the gap was “a vulnerability and I’m not going to step back from that” but added it was “a matter of government policy” as to what they choose to regulate. Labor’s Penny Wong is grilling the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, about a report from Michelle Grattan suggesting that Scott Morrison could have gone to Glasgow promising net zero even without the Nationals’ support. Birmingham said the prime minister had “respectfully engaged” in a process with the Nationals and it was “hypothetical” whether he could’ve gone to Glasgow promising net zero without their support. Asked if there was any discussion of him doing so, Birmingham replied: No – the prime minister was always intent on running a proper cabinet process. Wong said the Nationals could’ve been out-voted at cabinet, and noted Barnaby Joyce’s public comments about it being within Morrison’s remit to promise net zero. Wong argued that all this meant whatever Morrison had agreed to amounted to “taxpayer funds to purchase political peace with the National party” for a decision he could’ve imposed if he wanted. Birmingham rejected that. He said Australia was “best served” by keeping Australians together and negotiations within the government were a “function of representatives democracy” to ensure that diverse interests were represented. Birmingham said he hadn’t seen the Nationals’ letter but “we work through the different issues that are raised”, confirming he had been briefed on them. James Chisholm, a first assistant secretary at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said he hadn’t prepared advice on the demands, nor seen the list. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, said this likely meant the department hadn’t seen it. Wong questioned how the government could claim the document was cabinet in confidence if the department that administered cabinet hadn’t even seen it. The call has now moved to Coalition senators. In Victoria, a woman in her 20s is among the seven Covid deaths announced today, as health minister Martin Foley said more than 800 people were in hospital with the virus. The deaths also included a man in his 40s, a man in his 60s, two women and a man in their 80s and a man in his 90s. It came as Foley and the Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, both urged people to continue to get vaccinated and to remain cautious of restrictions and of symptoms. Weimar also announced a series of pop-up vaccination clinics aimed at communities with “lower levels” of vaccine take-up, and he pointed out that many of the new cases were unvaccinated people. He said: What we’ve seen now with a new case in the last week, two-thirds of the new cases every single day are not vaccinated. Not the first dose, not fully vaccinated, they’re just not vaccinated... Some of the local government areas of concern, in Wyndham, 96% of those new cases under the age of 40 were vaccinated. In Hume, 97% of new cases under the age of 40 were not fully vaccinated. Please, for your protection and the possession of those you love around you, get the vaccination job done over the coming days. Weimar welcomed the drop in case numbers today but said it was imperative people remained vigilant about symptoms and getting tested across the metropolitan Melbourne. Testing numbers across metropolitan Melbourne were slightly down at 94,000 over the weekend, he said. Cabinet isn’t scheduled to meet until tonight, so don’t expect any updates from the coalition on climate. There will be a lot of back and forth on rhetoric in question time, but no answers. Party room doesn’t meet until tomorrow – after cabinet has signed off on the deal. The Australian federal police’s deputy commissioner of operations, Ian McCartney, says some groups in Australia have viewed the 6 January attack on the US Capitol “as an inspiration point”. During Senate estimates, McCarney was asked whether he’d seen any evidence that Australians had been inspired by the attack. He was also asked of any links to individuals in Australia. McCartney replied that a colleague in the NSW police had referred to the “petri dish of hate” on the internet. McCarney told the committee: I think there has been some groups in Australia that have looked at that as an inspiration point, but it’s not binary. There are a lot of factors at play and a lot of different views at play. McCartney also referred to the Australian terrorist responsible for the Christchurch attack, saying: Unfortunately his manifesto has been an inspiration point for other attacks, so this type of ideology is fuelling concern. Origin Energy has responded to Nino’s post about the fine. From retail executive manager Jon Briskin: When we discovered this issue, we self-reported to the regulator, apologised, credited the accounts of current Victorian small business customers who were charged the $22 fee in error, and offered refunds to former customers.” We value our customers and take all of our compliance obligations seriously, so we are disappointed we did not implement these regulatory changes correctly and we are sorry.” New Zealand reported 109 new cases of Covid-19 today, as the country’s outbreak grows to 2,681 cases. Last week, prime minister Jacinda Ardern outlined New Zealand’s pathway forward through the pandemic, introducing a new “traffic light” system that would end lockdowns once the country reached 90% vaccination. Today the ministry of health announced 87% of eligible New Zealanders (aged 12 and over) had received at least one vaccine dose, and 71% were vaccinated with both doses. There are ongoing concerns that Māori, who are behind in vaccinations, will be disproportionately affected by illness and death. As of today, 69% of Māori had had one dose and 48% were fully vaccinated. Auckland, the centre of the outbreak, has now hit 90% first doses, and 77% fully vaccinated. All of the day’s cases were restricted to the North Island: 103 in Auckland, four in Waikato and two in Northland. A single case detected in the South Island over the weekend has not yet resulted in further infections. Thirty-five people are in hospital with Covid-19 – a drop of 15 from yesterday – and five are in intensive care. Still in energy estimates, Labor has been asking what has happened to the government’s national electric vehicles strategy that was due in the middle of last year. Just a note here, transport accounts for about 17% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Jo Evans from the department confirms that the strategy was due more than a year ago but the pandemic, and other things, forced a change of course. Labor’s Jenny McAllister then asks about the future fuels strategy, or the FFS – which probably fairly conveys how we all feel about how this hearing is progressing today. Evans says what was the electric vehicles strategy became the future fuels strategy and again, no word on when we might see it. Government senator Zed Seselja says: The answer is those policies will be released. In terms of the timing that’s going to be a matter for the minister [Angus Taylor], I’m not going to pre-empt it. Please save us from these references: The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has requested an “urgent review” of measures to protect the safety of parliamentarians. Prosecutors in the UK last week charged a man with the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. During Senate estimates, when asked about the safety of MPs, senators and electoral candidates in Australia, Kershaw said the AFP had “taken this issue very seriously”: Last year I did bring out the UK anti-terrorism command from the UK Met to have a look at our overall protection for MPs and high office holders and part of that included looking at the threat assessments and a whole range of initiatives. So we are looking at a new model for us around what services we could be able to provide protection, whether that’s physical protection, liaison, other solutions that perhaps in the past we haven’t had a look at those kind of different layers. Our model tends to be almost an all-in or nothing kind of model, so we’re looking at how could we service all of the parliamentarians in a better way, and provide that level of reassurance, what do you do when you’ve got these threats coming in and not to take them lightly, because I know a lot of the electorates receive lots of threats and concerning letters and other things. We do have to work with the state police as well, often that’s their jurisdiction. Brett Pointing, the AFP’s deputy commissioner of operations, added: The commissioner has tasked me to conduct an urgent review to see what additional strategies could be employed to enhance the safety of members of parliament. I think what happened in the UK was a stark reminder of the unpredictability of this environment and members of parliament are often at public events, there are often people there who have different views, sometimes extreme views, and it’s extremely important for us to work with members of parliament and the broader intelligence community to make sure we have up-to-date intelligence, and that that intelligence is converted into a security overlay that provides a best possible security for our members of parliament. So we look forward to doing that piece of work as a matter of urgency. Labor’s Kristina Keneally asked about the timeframes, given that Australia “could be in an election campaign in a matter of weeks or a matter of months”. Pointing: We’re working through that now and I’ve got to report back to the commissioner by 11 November. Origin Energy have been slugged a record $5m in penalties after allegedly charging prohibited exit fees to more than 20,000 customers. The Victorian Essential Services Commission issued 250 penalty notices to Origin after finding that more than 77,000 gas and electricity small business contracts wrongly included exit fees. Exit fees adding up to $489,774 had been wrongly charged to 22,371 customers, the watchdog found. Commissioner Sitesh Bhojani says it is the largest penalty issued by the commission to an energy company. He said: Origin Energy knew at all times about the changes in the law banning exit fees and they even reviewed 19 different contract templates, but didn’t remove the exit fees. Given the size and standing of Origin Energy, the commission is concerned about the company’s compliance culture over that four-and-a-half-year period from 2016 to 2020. Some of the affected businesses were charities and not-for-profits who can’t afford extra fees. Some were charged multiple times, paying thousands of dollars in prohibited fees. A local council, places of worship and charities were all incorrectly charged fees by the company, the commission found. Despite receiving customer complaints as early as 2018, Origin did not stop charging the fees until late last year, Bhojani said. At least one customer thought Origin was being generous after they complained and were told the fee would be waived. The case came to light in September 2020 after Origin Energy reported the alleged breaches of Victoria’s electricity and gas industry acts to the commission. In Victoria, exit fees can only be included on fixed-term retail contracts with fixed tariffs, charges and fees, which was not the case with these small business contracts. Origin advised the commission it was trying to contact former customers, with fewer than half having been reimbursed. The commission issues energy industry penalty notices where it has reason to believe a business has committed a contravention, but payment of a penalty is not an admission of a contravention. It’s all going great: The ATO would like to remind you that this is the last week to get your tax return in (without late penalties): The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is reminding Australians that this is the last week to either lodge their tax return or register with a registered tax agent. So far this tax time, over $20 billion has been refunded to more than 7.2 million taxpayers. Assistant Commissioner Tim Loh understands that tax might have been the last thing on people’s minds these last few months. If you’re planning to DIY your tax but haven’t got around to it yet, don’t worry. For people with simple tax affairs, lodging through our myTax service can be done and dusted in under 30 minutes. Most of your income and personal details will already be there; simply confirm it’s correct, add any additional income and claim your eligible deductions.” If you’re lodging with a registered tax agent the same information will be available to them. You may also have a bit longer to get your return in; all you need to do is be registered with your agent before the end of this week. Over in the House, Indi independent MP Helen Haines has introduced her federal integrity commission bill. Rex Patrick introduced Haines’ bill in the Senate late last week. Most of the crossbenchers are pushing to make this as much of an issue as they can, and are hoping to drag moderate Liberals into supporting a commission that could actually do something, rather than the model the government has suggested For what it is worth, Bob Katter has thoughts on net zero which include his discovery that majorities don’t mean everyone agrees. (Just wait until he finds out how the country’s vote was split at the last election.) Here is the press release his office sent out: Bob Katter says the National Party has backed net-zero by 2050 despite putting up a huge fight, ‘which means a large proportion of their party room thought it was wrong and now they’re just going to do the wrong thing.’ “They’re going to the bend the knee and go with it, destroying what little credibility they had left,” Mr Katter said. “They went to the last election opposing this strongly and now, three years later they’re going along with it.” Mr Katter said before cheering for net-zero, every Australian must understand the concept that to buy something from overseas you must sell something. “The only things that we produce of significance are coal, iron-ore, copper, zinc and aluminium,” he said. “Everything else is very small by comparison. Now, you’re going to wipe out coal – unless you’re lying of course. And by doing so, you will also ban these other metals because they must be smelted with coal. It would be ridiculously costly to smelt it any other way. “My own thoughts are that the LNP and ALP are lying through their feet about net-zero and won’t be game enough to bankrupt the country.” AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said while religiously motivated violent extremism remained Australia’s biggest terrorism threat, the growth in ideologically motivated violent extremist was providing challenges. He cited the following factors as posing those challenges: its rural and regional presence its influence over young people the high levels of security consciousness access to firearms among adherents The IMVE cohort is extremely interconnected, especially online. Their views are diverse and include supports for nationalist, white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The AFP has detected a number of threats, and concentrated investigative efforts on individuals or small networks (three to four individuals) who are not aligned to members of a specific nationalist or racist group. More broadly, Kershaw said law enforcement was mindful of “global instability, including the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan”. The Australian Islamist cohort is influenced by both the Isil and AQ ideology, however there is a greater number aligned to the Isil ideology. We expect that Isil will transform and re-establish transnational links to increase their ability to direct or influence terrorism in other parts of the globe. Kershaw told the estimates committee that other significant threats were “the terrorist offenders released from Australian jails”, adding that the UK and NZ were “experiencing similar challenges”: Eighteen terrorist offenders are scheduled for release from prison before 2026, and 54 are due for release by 2060. He said the community safety risk posed by the reintegration of convicted terrorist offenders into the community would be an ongoing challenge, and the AFP had established a dedicated capability to manage this risk. Without naming names, he said an offender “who was recently released almost immediately went online to access information about executions, beheadings and torture”. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has warned of “individuals who are now pre-loaded with extremist ideology” while declaring that the end of restrictions on movement “will make it harder for law enforcement”. Kershaw used an opening statement to a Senate estimates hearing to say Australians “need to remain vigilant” about the threat of terrorism as lockdowns end and borders reopen. He said the threat of terrorism remains at “probable”, but noted: There have been some significant shifts, in the diversity and complexity of the environment, since the pandemic started almost a year and a half ago. The threat of terrorism has not dissipated. In fact, the pandemic, extended lockdowns and more time spent online, has in some cases, made it easier for extremists to recruit. Increased anti-government sentiment, proliferation of conspiracy theories, physical isolation and more time spent online have increased the threat, facilitating local and transnational links between individuals and groups, and sharing of ideas among extremist communities. Across the world, including in Australia, we have individuals who are now pre-loaded with extremist ideology, and the end of restrictions on movement will make it harder for law enforcement. Kershaw said religiously motivated violent extremism remained the biggest threat – comprising 85% of AFP investigations – while 15% related to ideologically motivated violent extremism (a new umbrella term that includes rightwing extremism). (For comparison, the intelligence agency Asio has said its own investigations into ideologically motivated violent extremists, such as racist and nationalist violent extremists, have grown, with such investigations having “approached 50% of our onshore priority counter-terrorism caseload” last financial year.) Kershaw continued: The AFP and our partners are protecting Australians from terrorism on a number of fronts, including the concerning trend of young children occupying the attention of law enforcement agencies. Children as young as 13 years old – not even old enough to get their learners’ driver’s licence – are planning and negotiating with others online to carry out catastrophic terror attacks. Some of these youth feel isolated or do not feel like they belong, and so they retreat to the online world, looking to connect with someone, including RMVE and IMVE individuals. Labor’s Jenny McAllister has been asking officials in the energy estimates hearing whether stakeholders – such as the Australian Industry Group and the Clean Energy Council – had been consulted about the government’s long-term emissions reduction strategy. Jo Evans, a deputy secretary in the industry, science, energy and resources department, says stakeholders were consulted as part of the technology roadmap that was released in September 2020and the roadmap is at the core of the strategy. McAllister takes that as meaning no industry group has been consulted about the emissions strategy that will be taken to the Glasgow climate summit next week: This is everything we have feared about a government that is entirely addicted to secrecy. You are going to Cop with a plan that no one has seen. The chances of this passing before the election are pretty slim. As AAP reports: Children aged under 16 would need their parents’ consent to use social media platforms under a proposed online crackdown. Attorney-General Michaelia Cash on Monday released an exposure draft of new legislation to create a binding privacy code for social media services, data brokers and other large online operators. All platforms would be forced to receive parental consent for users under the age of 16. Social media companies would be required to take all reasonable steps to verify users’ age and put children’s best interests first when handling personal information. There would be tougher penalties and more enforcement powers handed to the privacy regulator. Online platforms subject to the code would need to comply with strict new privacy requirements, including new rules about children and other vulnerable groups. The code will be developed with the Australian Information Commissioner and industry. Organisations would face tougher requirements to be transparent about how personal information is handled. Senator Cash said the bill would ensure Australians’ privacy would be treated more carefully and transparently by online platforms. “We know that Australians are wary about what personal information they give over to large tech companies,” she said. “Our draft legislation means that these companies will be punished heavily if they don’t meet that standard.” Labor is yet to outline its climate policy but that hasn’t stopped Anthony Albanese from trying to keep all the focus on what the Coalition is or is not doing: The climate wars haven’t even ended within the National party. Matt Canavan has been out there opposing this target. Barnaby Joyce, apparently, was the last speaker in the room and said he was opposed to it. Now, when Scott Morrison jets off to Europe, Barnaby Joyce will be the acting prime minister of this country, someone who doesn’t support this target as Australia’s position. So, it’s very clear that the Coalition government remain divided. They remain in a state of conflict. Their negotiations aren’t about good policy. It’s all about politics, as everything that this government does. Senate estimates have begun for the energy portfolio and, if you were hoping it might shed some light on the deal for net zero, I am here to disappoint you. Senators have been quizzing the government this morning about the agreement between the Nationals and the Liberal party for a “process” to work towards a net zero by 2050 target. The department has told the hearing it’s not in a position to answer questions because the information is cabinet in confidence. Officials told Labor senator Jenny McAllister they can’t answer questions about whether they’ve been asked to provide advice about the National party’s list of demands in exchange for an agreement on a net zero target, whether the department had been asked to provide advice on a government-funded coal-fired power station, or any advice on costs. Senator Zed Seselja also told the hearing the energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor had made a public interest immunity claim and would not be tabling the government’s net zero emissions modelling in the parliament. Both McAllister and the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked Seselja if he knew what was in the deal the Coalition had struck. Seselja said he couldn’t comment on cabinet processes. Hanson-Young: Are you aware of what the deal consists of? I’m not asking you for the detail, I’m asking you if you even know what’s in it, mate. You don’t know what’s in it, do you? Here is some of the current deputy prime minister being as clear as coal dust about what it is the National party has actually agreed to. Net zero emissions by 2050, according to Barnaby Joyce, is apparently “a goal”. Not a target. Or even a nationally determined contribution, which is what Scott Morrison told the Liberal party room it would be. (A NDC is a commitment that says “here is what the nation will do” offered up to the international community. It doesn’t need legislation but it carries more weight than just a statement. It’s basically a handshake deal.) Here was Joyce (speaking very closely to the microphone) on ABC radio RN this morning: I said to you quite clearly, un ambiguously, I am 100% onboard with the goal to achieve net zero by 2050 because that was a decision of the National party room. I’ve also clearly stated that it was always the case as told to you, told to everyone that the process would be that no individual would make the decision and the party room would make the decision. The party room has moved decision. I abide by the party room, I am 100% onboard with the goal of net zero reaching by 2050. I can’t make it clearer than that. Except it’s not meant to be a “goal”. It’s meant to be a commitment. Meanwhile on the other side of the Coalition: No one is allowed to see the modelling the Morrison government is using in its net zero target: NSW and Victoria have reported their Covid numbers for this morning: The first round of estimates hearings is about to get under way. Today’s schedule includes finance and public administration, legal and constitutional affairs, environment and comms and rural and regional affairs. And then we get to the myth. Matt Canavan: I don’t think this is the right approach for this country. It’s a fantasy to think we can remove all carbon emissions* and normally when you pursue a fantasy it doesn’t end well because you forget about other things that are really important and I think right now what is important is securing the defence of this country and making sure we continue to have jobs post-Covid. *Net zero does not mean no emissions. At all. It means emissions are meant to be offset, not that there are no emissions. And your regular reminder Matt Canavan is an economist by trade and his only time in mines has been as a politician/for photoshoots (anyone working in a coalmine who gets that much coal dust on them needs to immediately contact OH&amp;S and report it, given the health risks we know come from breathing in the dust). Canavan: This guy is not for turning. I think this remains a bad deal for this country. Somebody in this place has got to stand up for the workers of Australia* and I’ll keep doing that because I think net zero is going to end in tears. It is going to end in higher power prices, fewer jobs for Australians and make us weaker at a time where China is being pretty aggressive in our region. I’ll keep up the fight. I had a loss yesterday. I couldn’t have fought any harder. *Yet to hear Canavan speak on the estimated 40,000 job losses in the university sector over the last couple of years, or the jobs which have been lost in the arts because of the lack of government support during the pandemic. Queensland LNP senator and former minister Matt Canavan continued his opposition to net zero emissions this morning on the Nine Network: I don’t agree with the decision. I let the room know yesterday that I will – as I say, I’ll continue to fight for special the blue-collar workers of this country. I don’t think they have much of a voice down here. The Labor party long since deserted them. I think it’s unfortunate our party is jumping onboard with this green fantasy. I know the people that support the Liberal and National parties aren’t big supporters of big government and don’t forget net zero is another word for big government telling you what to eat, what to drive, what electricity you can use. I believe people should make their own decisions and not bureaucrats from Canberra. This is the level of “debate” from people who have “big” futures in the National party. The latest Newspoll is out and AAP has taken a look at it: The latest Newspoll, published in the Australian on Monday, found Labor is leading the coalition 54 per cent to 46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. This compares to the last poll three weeks ago when Labor was leading 53 per cent to 47 per cent. Asked about the federal government’s priorities, 47 per cent of voters polled nominated meeting targets to cut emissions while 40 per cent pointed to keeping energy prices down. When the same question on priorities was asked in February this year, the outcome was 43 per cent to 42 per cent, respectively. The poll, conducted between October 20-23, also found 35 per cent of voters believed a Labor government would be better at leading the response to climate change compared to 28 per cent for a coalition government. On the primary voting measure, support for the Coalition was at 35 per cent compared to 38 per cent for Labor. This was the worst result for the government since December 9, 2018, according to the poll conducted by YouGov. But it also found Prime Minister Scott Morrison was considered the better leader at 48 per cent, compared to 34 per cent for Labor’s Anthony Albanese. Lt General John Frewen also had an update on the third dose of the vaccine timetable this morning (he was speaking to the ABC): Booster doses for the immunocompromised have started and that’s just to bring the people up to the same level of protection that rest of us achieve through just two doses. But we’re waiting on Atagis’s advice now around boosters. We expect that the advice is imminent and we think what’s going to happen is that a booster shot will be made available from six months, from your second dose. So we’ll work the priority groups in the very first instance, aged care, disability, frontline health workers and those sorts of areas. But we think what will happen is that as people become eligible from six months, they’ll just be able to go and grab a booster shot. For an insight into the Nationals party room meeting yesterday, you can read Murph (a reminder, this small group of people are not only selling the message, they are also influential in setting policy as all three now sit in the cabinet): By the end of of a two-hour party room conversation, a majority of colleagues were in favour of the net zero transition, provided Morrison followed through on the various high-level policy undertakings. There wasn’t a formal vote in the room, but a tally was kept. Joyce acknowledged the majority position in favour when he spoke at the end of the debate. According to multiple sources, at that point the deputy prime minister also revealed his own position. Joyce told his colleagues he was not in favour of net zero. This is, of course, pretty extraordinary. What this means is the Nationals leader – Australia’s deputy prime minister – is now fronting a Nationals party room decision that he personally doesn’t agree with. It’s not just Joyce. Two other Nationals ministers – Bridget McKenzie and Keith Pitt – were also serious net zero sceptics, if not outright opponents. (Some say McKenzie was recorded as a no vote on Sunday, although recounts of her remarks to colleagues are hard to follow.) And, given that the agriculture industry is already making its own changes, I don’t know what this means: Oh good. Just a reminder that he will be acting prime minister for the week Scott Morrison is in Glasgow. Meanwhile, what’s going on with the Australian Open? Well, unvaccinated players may be able to attend, as long as they go through two weeks of hotel quarantine. Which seems to contradict this from the government last week: Asked on ABC radio on Wednesday morning whether he had a message for Djokovic, Alex Hawke reiterated that anyone entering the country must be double vaccinated. “The government in establishing its borders has said that you will need to be double vaccinated to visit Australia, that’s a universal application, not just for tennis players,” Hawke said. Asked if he could see any workaround for the Australian Open, Hawke said “not at this time”. “Our health advice is that when we open the borders everyone that comes to Australia will need to be double vaccinated.” So there is still quite a bit to play out there. But David Littleproud wants you to know that the Nationals will be honest with you at the next election: We’ll be honest with the Australian people and look them square in the eyes and tell the truth. That’s what they want out of government, not just someone who signs up to it blindly but has no plan to get there. And if that’s what the public want from the Labor party who are able to do this without any scrutiny, you’ll see a detailed plan in the next 24-48 hours from us. Whereas the other mob are pinning their hope on a few electric cars. Q: Do you support electric cars? Littleproud: Definitely. Q: So what’s wrong with supporting electric cars given that petrol-powered cars are being phase out in the next 15 years? Littleproud: I have no issue. So long as people have vehicles. The reality is that the market will decide that. You’re seeing cars move towards hybrids and many other changes in technology. So I’m agnostic to that. The reality is that I need them to work, but in my parts of the world where I have an electorate three times the size of Victoria, I just need to be able to plug them in somewhere. But the reality is that in some areas, it will be acceptable for those areas to have. So I’m not against that. But if that’s all the Labor party has, the detail of their plan will surely cost you a lot more than a few electric vehicles is the point I’m making. So what about the actual issue Cop26 will be looking at – the 2030 targets? Any shift on that? David Littleproud: That is important and we also met Kyoto. But we don’t shift the goalposts during a game of football. You keep them where they are. And the fact that we’re going to overshoot that says a lot about Australia and says a lot about what we’ve done in the last decade to achieve that. We should be proud of that. Our chins should be up and our chests out as a nation, instead of the self-loathing. We’ve done a lot of heavy lifting and what the reality is that we will overshoot it and what we’re now going to say is that as the cabinet agrees, we’ll get to a position of setting a goal to reach 2050 net zero, so the world can look at us and say that we’re fair dinkum because we’re going to squarely look them in the eyes and say this is how we get there and who pays. Except we really haven’t, as Adam Morton has been reporting for years: So do Barnaby Joyce and Keith Pitt support the deal? You can’t know. I they speak out against it, they will have to resign from the cabinet. But you’re not allowed to know their actual position. David Littleproud: I won’t tell you because what happens in our party room stays in the sanctity of that party room. That’s what we respect as National party members and I don’t intend to commentate on anyone’s position, nor my own. We all made that in the sanctity of the room and got to the position that we as a party room should support. But what sort of future can Matt Canavan have in the party, given his very, very loud objections to any sort of emissions reduction target? David Littleproud: In the National party, a big one. The culture of the National party is celebrating people who are prepared to stand for their convictions and the courage of that. Matt obviously has a differing view to the rest of the party room. And we respect that. That’s not something that we denigrate in the National party. You want that in Canberra. You want the diversity of ideas and to be prosecuted. As a National party party room, we got to a different position than Matt Canavan and he made that clear yesterday. But why can’t people know now what is in the deal which has ensured the Nationals “in-principle” support for climate policy? David Littleproud: That’s part of the cabinet process and you’re just going to have to wait another 24 hours because obviously it has to be ratified by cabinet as a cabinet document. And I could go to jail if I start talking about it and I’m sure that you done want to see that! But we worked through this as quickly as we can and when we see the roadmap and what the National party has asked for. We’ve done this in a very mature sense. We worked through this calmly and rationally as a party. And as a Coalition, and the prime minister and the treasurer have been working closely with the deputy prime minister and myself and our party room, along with Angus Taylor, to make sure that we’ve got the comfort of securing those jobs in regional Australia now and creating new jobs. And if you’re a coalminer today in the Hunter or in central Queensland, you will have a job well beyond 2030, well beyond 20 and well beyond 2050 particularly if carbon capture storage takes off*. (*Spoiler: it won’t) Nationals deputy leader David Littleproud has been the main spokesperson of the new “mature” and “reasonable” Nats. So what is in the deal? You can’t know yet. He told the ABC: Well, obviously the prime minister has been very respectful to the National party from the start saying that regional Australia wouldn’t be impacted and there would be mitigants put in place and, so long as they appear in that, the National party is onboard. And we have no reason to believe that it will be anything other than that, because it’s been a respectful process, one that we started last Sunday in seeing the detail of the technology roadmap, and now we work through that in a mature and sensible way to get to the resolution, and tonight that will be ratified and obviously, the prime minister will make those announcements, I would suspect, tomorrow morning. Well. That was quite the weekend. The Nationals are now trying to rebrand as “calm and rational” over their climate views, with the junior Coalition partner agreeing to in-principle support for a net zero emissions target by 2050. Well, most of the Nationals. Matt Canavan wants everyone to know its a bad deal. But what is the deal? No one knows. Keith Pitt is back in the cabinet, after he was booted as part of Barnaby Joyce’s return, so the Nats got another cabinet spot (and vote). Other than that – it is all secret. But it’s calm and rational. Apparently. Sarah Martin and Katharine Murphy gave up their Sunday to try to make sense of the position: The Nationals MP George Christensen, who has repeatedly threatened to shift to the crossbench, told colleagues he would now reconsider his position in the government in protest at the party’s position. Christensen attended the meeting remotely, wearing a “support coal” T-shirt. Others who spoke out strongly against the target included Matt Canavan and Wide Bay MP Llew O’Brien. The party’s Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, also spoke against supporting the deal, and suggested Joyce could yet secure more for the party through the cabinet process. The fact remains though that Australia’s government has been turning itself inside out just to get to this point but most of the rest of the world has moved to 2030 and action this decade – something Australia is not budging on. So don’t expect this issue to go away. In fact, expect the election campaign to be bitterly fought on this point – with more scare tactics about “cost” and “plans”. Just remember that “meet and beat” is not the whole truth. On that, the environment team have spent months putting this new podcast series together – it gives you all the history and knowledge you could need to understand what has happened – and what’s ahead. We’ll bring you all of the day’s events as they unfold. Cabinet is meeting today and we have question time – as well as the first day of estimates hearings. Mike Bowers is already hard at work and we’ll get to as many committees as we can. Just follow Penny Wong’s eyebrows. Meanwhile, congratulations to NSW students, parents and carers and school staff, with remote learning now a thing of the past. I don’t think any of us who have not been directly impacted can understand what school has been like for much of the past two years and I hope today is filled with as many happy reunions as possible. And Victoria is looking at being reunited on Friday, with the 80% vaccination target about to be met, which means Melbourne and the regions will no longer be kept apart. Given how many loved ones have been separated that is just wonderful news. I understand there are still concerns – everyone can take it as slow as they like, and if you are not ready to rush out, you don’t have to. Just take it at your own pace. Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp will keep you updated on all of the politics today, with the rest of the Guardian stepping in to let you know important things happening outside of Canberra. It being a sitting week, you have Amy Remeikis on the blog until the end of the day. It is going to be a busy week – Scott Morrison is due to leave for Glasgow on Thursday, so there is a bit to get through before then.

What are the key policies – and what’s missing? Ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 Not only will consumers be unable to buy petrol and diesel cars, the strategy also says that by 2035 all cars must be fully zero emissions capable. There’s new cash for the transition to electric vehicles – further funding of £620m for zero emission vehicle grants and electric charging infrastructure. That is likely to focus on residential streets – charging points that can be used by the average consumer. But there is little in the plan – beyond market forces – that directly helps people afford new electric cars. By 2035 the UK will be powered entirely by clean electricity This energy transition will involve at least one new large nuclear plant by 2024 and a new £120m fund will also develop technology for possible future reaction. Wylfa, in north Wales, is named as one such site. But renewables will be a key factor, with the aim of 40GW of offshore wind power by 2030 and the creation of more onshore wind and solar energy supplies. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Ofgem are consulting on and introducing changes designed to boost investment in wind, but there are fears that it will come too late to meet the target without other interventions. Investment in hydrogen production The strategy aims to deliver 5GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, while halving emissions from oil and gas. It emphasises the need to “manage the transition in a way that protects jobs and investment, uses existing infrastructure, maintains security of supply, and minimises environmental impacts”. 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 One of the more eye-catching policies was an ambition for the UK to become “a world-leader in zero emission flight” and saying the UK aimed to kickstart the commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuel “so people can fly, and connect without guilt”. By 2030, however, the percentages are still small. The ambition is to ensure 10% of fuel used by airlines is sustainable, as well as £180m in funding for the development of sustainable aviation fuel plants. Cash to upgrade home heating systems from gas boilers to heat pumps There will be £5,000 grants to help 90,000 households install home heat pumps, and other low-carbon heating systems, over the next three years. Heat pumps cost much more than replacement gas boilers. The government hopes the grants should bring the costs to similar levels until prices rapidly decrease, a gamble that the market will take care of the millions more homes in Britain that are powered by gas boilers. Downing Street has declined to say whether the government will ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said “there will be a point” when the voluntary approach would no longer be sufficient. But Johnson wrote in the Sun newspaper that he was determined to protect consumer choice saying “the Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi”. Triple the rate of woodland creation in England The strategy includes many commitments to improving nature and commits to at least 30,000 hectares a year of new woodland. Farmers will be incentivised to implement a range of low-carbon farming practices, including guidance on the tax treatment of trees and woodlands, to provide greater clarity to landowners on how new and existing trees on their land affect tax liabilities. What’s missing? Ambitious plans for insulation There are 19m homes below EPC band C that need upgrading, in order to be energy efficient but there is little help for more than a tiny fraction of those homes. Gaps in commitments on fossil fuel The government has committed to phasing out coal power completely by 2024 to cut carbon emissions, but it is still used when it is better value than gas and was used only recently during the pricing chaos. There is no commitment to end new licences for oil and gas exploration, and to phase out production. Alternatives to car and air travel The government still invests £27bn in new roads and airport expansions have been given the go-ahead. The transport aspect of the strategy is very car-focused, though there is a commitment to increase the share of journeys taken by public transport, investing in cycling and walking and electrifying more railway lines. Meat and dairy farming A controversial topic that the government has shied away from completely is whether to make any recommendations around meat and dairy consumption. Last year, UK’s health experts called for a climate tax to be imposed on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025. Future of fuel duty New forms of taxation are only hinted at in the strategy but the Treasury warns of a significant loss of revenue to the public purse as income from fuel duty drops when people switch to electric. Road pricing is seen as a fairer possible system to raise revenue than fuel duty and motoring taxes and the Treasury’s accompanying document says it will “consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Home Office criticised over handling of Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","fields":{"headline":"Home Office criticised over handling of Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","bodyText":"A scientist conducting groundbreaking research into renewable energy is facing deportation with his family to Sri Lanka, where he experienced torture, after receiving contradictory information about his case from the Home Office. Dr Nadarajah Muhunthan, 47, his wife Sharmila, 42, and their three children, aged 13, nine and five, came to the UK in 2018 after Muhunthan, who is working on thin-film photovoltaic devices used to generate solar energy, was given a prestigious Commonwealth Rutherford fellowship. The award allowed him to come to the UK for two years to research and develop the technology. His wife obtained a job caring for elderly people in a nursing home. The family are Tamils, a group that has experienced persecution in Sri Lanka. In November 2019, Muhunthan returned to his home country for a short visit to see his sick mother. While there he was arrested and persecuted by the Sri Lankan government. He managed to escape and returned to the UK, where he claimed asylum on the basis of what he had experienced on his visit to Sri Lanka. After his scholarship expired in February 2020, neither he nor his wife were permitted to continue working. A Home Office case worker sent an email on 20 September this year, saying the family’s asylum claim was “under active consideration”, and another email on 11 October saying the asylum claim had been refused on 23 August – 28 days before the family were told their case was still under consideration. The family had been renting accommodation in Bristol and all the children were settled at school there. The couple’s eldest daughter, Gihaniya, received outstanding school reports with a 100% attendance rate and was particularly praised for her achievements in science. She hopes to study to be a doctor when she is older. The Home Office moved the family from their rented accommodation in Bristol to a London hotel last month, uprooting all three children from school. The two younger children now have school places but Gihaniya does not and is confined to the hotel. “It is so boring here. It is like a prison,” she told the Guardian. “I just want to go to school. Sometimes I put on my school uniform and just go and stand in the street.” When Muhunthan’s scholarship visa first expired, the manager of the nursing home begged the Home Office to allow Sharmila to continue working. “We are in dire need of trained healthcare staff and we urge you to consider Mrs Sharmila Muhunthan’s right to work for us as a matter of urgency,” her manager wrote. The request was refused. A year after lodging his asylum claim, Muhunthan was given permission by the Home Office to work because his area of expertise was listed as a shortage occupation. However, although he applied for university research jobs, the fact that he did not have UK residency deterred prospective employers. Both John Penrose, the family’s Conservative MP in Weston-super-Mare, where they previously lived, and their lawyer, who has issued a legal challenge against the Home Office about its handling of the case, criticised the department’s treatment of the family. In a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, on 1 October, Penrose wrote: “This looks like a wholly avoidable situation which has been caused by UK visas and immigration working too slowly.” The family’s lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC solicitors, said: “There is growing concern over the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, with the UN high commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, noting that ‘surveillance, intimidation and judicial harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and families of the disappeared has not only continued, but has broadened to a wider spectrum of students, academics, medical professionals and religious leaders critical of government policies’.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “All asylum and human rights claims will be carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with our international obligations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-15T10:28:41Z","webTitle":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","fields":{"headline":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","bodyText":"A team of students from the Netherlands are due to complete an 1,800-mile (3,000km) road trip across western Europe in a solar-powered camper van that they designed and built themselves. The Stella Vita is designed for two passengers and has a kitchen, sitting area, bed, shower and toilet. Using solar energy alone, the vehicle can cover up to 450 miles on a sunny day, reaching a top speed of 75mph, as well as powering all the inside amenities, a TV and a laptop. The vehicle has solar panels on the roof that can be expanded into a sun cover when parked. The van can also be charged through electric charging ports. “The technology is there, we just have to change the way we think,” said 20-year-old Tijn ter Horst, one of the Eindhoven University of Technology students onboard. “If 22 students can design and build a vehicle like this in one year, then I’m sure companies could as well.” The road trip, which started in Eindhoven on 19 September and was due to conclude in Tarifa, south-west Spain, on Friday, was part of the students’ self-set challenge to demonstrate the potential of solar energy. This is not the first solar-powered vehicle produced by the university, which first joined Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a biennial Australian solar vehicle competition, in 2013. “This year there was no competition so the students set their own goals and challenges” said Dr Carlo van der Weijer, who has been the team’s coordinator. While previous Eindhoven teams won consecutive competitions with their five-seater designs, Van der Weijer believes there may be a bigger commercial appetite for the mobile home. Ecologically minded camping enthusiasts might be tempted by an electric van that is not reliant on charging points, which remain scarce in many places, he said. According to the students, the Stella Vita has been a hit on Spanish roads, attracting attention from other drivers, and Van der Weijer said the vehicle was also an option in less sun-exposed locations. “On a cloudy day the vehicle can still produce 60-70% of the energy,” he said. “And even if there is no sun at all, you still have an efficient, normal electric car that you can charge from a charging port.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2021/oct/13/k-pop-k-boom-k-cinema-k-art-south-korea-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-13T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"K-boom!

How the unstoppable stars of K-pop went gunning for the art world","bodyText":"Ohnim is having a blue period, just like Picasso. Over Zoom from a gallery in Seoul, the Korean rapper Song Min-ho, better known as Mino to K-pop fans but Ohnim in the art world, shows me a painting he finished the previous evening in collaboration with artist Choi Na-ri. It depicts a blue crouched figure, like a depressed version of Rodin’s Thinker. It may be still wet but will soon be shipped to London’s Saatchi Gallery for an art fair that showcases work by three of Korea’s biggest K-pop stars. The meeting of K-pop and K-art is making the art world lick its lips. Businessman David Ciclitira, who set up the StART Art Fair at the Saatchi, says: “K-pop stars have immense reach through their social media. Guys like Mino, Henry Lau and Kang Seung-yoon, whose work will be in the show, have six to seven million followers each on Instagram. In Seoul, fans queue round the block just to see a work of art by any of them. Then they fight each other to buy. I don’t suppose it’ll be quite like that at the Saatchi Gallery, but you never know.” Ohnim and Kang Seung-yoon, both members of K-pop band Winner, and Canadian-born Henry Lau, former member of Super Junior-M, are effectively multimedia brands, combining singing, acting, making art, fashion, reality TV … and plugging products. Ohnim, for instance, endorses a German lip balm and did his first art show in collaboration with a Korean eyewear brand. He also modelled for Louis Vuitton. Stars such as Ohnim are part of what’s known as hallyu, or the “Korean wave” in culture, embracing K-pop, K-cinema (Oscar-winning Parasite), K-TV (Netflix’s Squid Game), K-tech (Samsung) and even K-philosophy. Next year, Frieze will launch a Seoul fair, while London’s Victoria and Albert Museum will showcase the popular culture of South Korea in an exhibition. And then there is the K-art diaspora, with artists such as Bath Spa University academic Young In Hong, and Korean-born American conceptual artist Anicka Yi, whose commission at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall opened this week. Successive South Korean governments have tried to ride the Korean wave, pursuing a strategy of exporting pop culture worldwide following the Asian financial crash in the late 1990s. “Hallyu has been a deliberate tool of soft power,” argues journalist Christine Ro. “Many countries invest in cultural councils and exchanges partly to strengthen diplomatic aims. But the South Korean government’s push for cultural power has had remarkably quick success.” There is even a crossover between K-pop and K-politics. BTS, the boyband whose collaboration with Coldplay is currently No 1 in the US, were made Special Presidential Envoys for Future Generations and Culture by South Korea’s president Moon Jae-In last month. They performed a prerecorded set at the UN, and made a speech praising the younger generation’s resilience during the pandemic and urging sustainable development. As I chat to Ohnim, I notice in the corner of his painting his signature motif of a happy-looking girl. “The picture is inspired by the coronavirus pandemic,” he says. “People are depressed, and that’s what the blue figure represents. But the background and the little girl say something different. They say: ‘It’s OK. There will be happiness.’ I try to be a good influencer, you see.” This is a surprisingly upbeat message for the 28-year-old, whose public battles with his mental health have endeared him to his South Korean fanbase. Three years ago, at the height of his fame with Winner, Ohnim disclosed he had been diagnosed with panic disorder. “Many things piled on and it happened,” he said at the time. “I always need to show a good appearance to the public and always shine, but there are a lot of things I need to deal with.” Making art has helped him. He told his Instagram followers: “In this day and age I feel that language itself cannot function in its right form. I wanted to create another type of communication, where the remnants of our feelings that are buried and hidden away can be conveyed through simple and distorted shapes. The inability to have real interpersonal relationships and human touch in the world we currently live in has made me realise that I am unable to escape feelings of emptiness and hollowness.” Art, he says, is proving better than three-minute K-pop songs at allowing him to explore not just his own mental health issues but to reflect on a world gone hideously wrong. In 2018, Ohnim collaborated on an eerie immersive installation called Burning Planet. Visitors to the space in Seoul’s Seongsu-dong district walked down a long dark tunnel to a room where an old man explained that he was a gatekeeper to the Burning Planet, a world located at the edge of our solar system. Guests then proceeded through a door into a speakeasy where a giant robotic ostrich explained that on the Burning Planet, all organic life is extinct except for humans and ostriches. And then, curiously, guests were invited to eat a dessert made from ostrich eggs, before entering another space depicting human life on this planet. Feeble light installations symbolised scarce solar energy, while performers performed a dull ballet of repetitive movements. Like the Planet of the Apes, the Burning Planet was really an allegory of our own. “So many of us are burned out in a world that we’re destroying,” he explained. As Onim sips his drink, from 5,500 miles away, I study the tattoos that ring his throat. They are little circles of weather icons – cloudy, sunny and so on. “I colour one in red to show what mood I’m in.” But none are ringed today? He shrugs, possibly because he doesn’t know which mood he is in. Onim’s art expresses something the philosopher Byung-Chul Han takes as symptomatic of contemporary South Korea. In his new book, Capitalism and the Death Drive, Han notes that his homeland has the highest suicide rate in the world. In part, he argues, this is because of the IMF bailout that followed the Asian financial crisis. Like Greece, South Korea was, he claims, forcibly subjected to “radical reprogramming” – what Naomi Klein called the “shock doctrine”. “In South Korea, there is no longer any real resistance to these measures,” Han writes. “Instead, one finds high levels of conformism and consensus – together with depression and burnout. Instead of seeking to change society, people use violence against themselves. The outward aggression that might have provided the basis for revolution has instead given way to auto-aggression.” Evidence for this diagnosis was clear in last year’s Korean Eye show at the Saatchi Gallery. One piece consisted of an A4 sheet of paper attached to a wall at its lower corners, one side bearing the image of a face drawn with a marker. Artist Kwantaeck Park arranged a fan to make the sheet rise up and down as if the face was bowing endlessly. Eunha Kim made a sculpture called Bon Appetit that looked like a hamburger but was made from discarded clothes. Lee Seung Koo installed a sculpture called Compromise Between Me and Me that looked like a dystopian Jeff Koons inflatable, with a huge gun firing gas-filled balloons shaped like hearts and oversized blood corpuscles across the gallery. The show’s curator, Dimitri Ozerkov, of St Petersburg’s State Hermitage Museum, wrote in his catalogue essay that Han was right in his diagnosis: auto-aggression bleeds into contemporary Korean culture and burnout; personality disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity are behind the nation’s creative fecundity. “This new societal condition may be characterised in terms of narcissism taken to the point of religious fervour.” K-art, then, is in a vexed position, both presenting Korea to the world, and at the same acting as a grenade that, as Ozekov puts it, “could blow the well-managed collective identity sky-high.” Korean art was terra incognita for westerners (the late Nam June Paik notwithstanding) until David Ciclitira, the chairman of Parallel Media and co-founder of Sky TV, began collecting with his wife Serenella around 15 years ago. Impressed with what they saw in Seoul’s galleries, they set up a programme called Global Eye aimed at developing the county’s arts infrastructure, and arranged shows to promote the arts of Asian countries from Vietnam to Indonesia. In 2012, Ciclitira set up Live Company, an events business that toured K-pop concerts to Asia and, eventually, Europe. Since then, his business interests have combined K-pop and K-art. On the wall behind him as we talk is the most striking Zoom backdrop I’ve encountered during the pandemic, namely a 3.2m x 2m embroidery called Procession by Young In Hong. “It was the first large embroidery piece I did,” she tells me from her Bristol studio. She made Procession in 2010, a decade before her adoptive city bore witness to the toppling of slave trader Edward Colston’s statue. But Procession is a work no less political. From the English west country, Young In Hong keeps a Korean eye on her homeland, meditating on its history and struggles. Visitors to London’s Royal Academy may remember, in 2017, a group of Koreans lying in the courtyard. This was Young In Hong’s performance piece 5100: Pentagon, memorialising students who were fired on, killed, raped and beaten by government troops in 1980’s Gwangju protests against martial law. “The performance commemorates a specific event but is also a means of acting out a certain resistance toward prevailing social norms,” she says. “I’m quite a sensitive person to what’s going on around me. Probably that’s one of the reasons I came here, to get a sense of perspective on my homeland.” Young In Hong’s latest project is a 15-metre long text piece installed last month at the disused Jejin station in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. “I picked this sentence from a book in which a woman is explaining to a lawyer why she wants to get a divorce. It reads: “Our rhythms have been out of sync in the past.” Young In Hong repurposes the text to comment on other things out of sync: North and South Korea, train timetables, men and women, humans and their mental health. Emblazoned in huge type over the entrance to the disused station, it is hardly an example of soft power or a lucrative investment opportunity for collectors, but it is certainly part of the K-art wave breaking both at home and abroad.

Not if he’s planning a climate con job","bodyText":"Should Scott Morrison go to the climate conference in Glasgow? It depends. In my view, he should only go to the Cop26 conference if he plans on making a decent contribution to increasing global climate action. And whether he would do that remains highly questionable. One of the biggest shocks I’ve had recently was hearing US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi congratulating Scott Morrison on his “climate leadership”. I nearly fell off my chair. The master of spin had somehow gone to Washington and conned one of America’s most important political figures, receiving accolades he didn’t deserve. He ran his government’s usual “meet and beat” line about the current Australian 2030 target, a claim that is fallacious and wrong, and not supported by its own projections. He presented it as a fact to Pelosi and to gullible foreign correspondents. The same could easily happen in Glasgow. In reality, Australia is one of the world’s laggards on climate change. Analysis after analysis has compared Australia’s performance on climate with other countries and all come up with the same view. The Climate Action Tracker’s latest analysis downgraded Australia’s overall rating to “highly insufficient” and shows the country isn’t on track to meet its 2030 target, which is itself insufficient. If all others followed this level of ambition we would warm the planet by 3C. The same analysis was repeated by a recent Climate Analytics/WRI G20 report, and others have made similar criticisms, including the UN secretary general’s office. Scott Morrison himself has publicly questioned whether it is worth his while going to Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow. He has been rightfully criticised for this uncertainty, given the fundamental importance of the Glasgow meeting for climate action globally, and the conjunction between the Glasgow meeting and the G20 leaders’ meeting in Italy the weekend before. Many of our partners have attached strategic importance to this meeting, notably the United States, the UK, the European Union, India, our Pacific island neighbours and many others. While it would be unusual for Morrison to miss out on being in the big G20 leaders’ photo call, he might want to avoid the G20 altogether, given that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be there – and who doesn’t want to be a fly on the wall for THAT conversation? If he’s planning to go to continue the spin seen in Washington DC and make empty announcements, he should stay at home. There are a set of conditions I think any Australian leader should meet before attending the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow next month. First, a suitably enhanced 2030 target (or “nationally determined contribution”) well north of a 50% reduction in emissions (below 2010 levels). A fully 1.5C compatible domestic pathway for Australia would be at least 65% reduction by 2030. Morrison should not sidestep and dodge this by talking about 2035. Second, a firm commitment to substantially increase financial contributions to climate action globally. Australia is one of the laggards in this area – the Climate Action Tracker gave it a “critically insufficient” rating on this issue. Australia needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and increase the level of its international climate finance. Third, take off the table, unambiguously, without conditions and once and for all, Australia’s long-held position on using “carryover” credits for meeting its Paris agreement obligations. Because to meet your 2030 target using carbon credits substantially derived from historically high deforestation levels 40 years ago would be the ultimate con job. And while he has announced he might not do this, there is wiggle room in the government’s target submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change. Fourth, Australia needs to support the highest possible level of environmental and accounting integrity in the Paris agreement rulebook, which is still not finalised and in which Australia had appalling positions in Madrid in 2019. Fifth, Australia needs to join with many other countries that are moving to phase out coal from the power sector early. The UK Powering Past Coal Alliance now has 41 state members, and the UN secretary general has called on countries to phase out thermal coal by 2030, consistent with the science. Coal phaseout will also be on the G20 agenda. Finally, Australia should join with many other countries in committing unambiguously to reach net zero emissions nationally by 2050 at the latest. This may sound like a lot, but it’s actually exactly what many of our peers have done. This position would put Australia at parity with the UK, the EU, the US and others. That’s all. It would not particularly establish Australia as a leader but one that has simply just caught up with what its counterparts are doing as the world responds to the growing climate crisis. Unless Morrison does these things, then whatever he does in Glasgow would simply be more empty announcements, which he is becoming famous for. Because, on the ground in Australia the federal government has virtually no policies on anything that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions; if anything it’s the opposite. The Morrison government’s gas-led recovery is pouring tens of millions into enabling more gas resource development when we don’t need it – a move that will only make meeting Paris compatible targets harder. He is focusing on subsidising carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that has a well-established track record for not working, increasing rather than decreasing costs, and deploying this in the next decade to expand the production of oil. His government continues to support coal and developing new coalmines. With the Adani coalmine heading towards its first shipment of coal by the end of the year, possibly around the Glasgow timeframe, how great will that look? Morrison’s government continues to promote policies that would keep coal in the power system and that would create blockages to solar energy, dubbed “coalkeeper” and “solar stopper”, respectively. Fortunately, the states are jacking up against this, but that has not stopped him. He has no policies to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles, and his government appears antagonistic to this technology. Australia is alone in the developed world for not having motor vehicle CO2 efficiency standards, and our fleet efficiency is going backwards. Morrison does not support green hydrogen, instead he is focusing on so-called “clean hydrogen” – hydrogen made with fossil gas, deploying carbon capture and storage which goes under the marketing name of “blue hydrogen”. Blue of course is a marketing colour that is designed to have a soft appeal to consumers, but there is nothing soft or nice about blue hydrogen. And it will not reduce emissions. So should Scott Morrison go to Glasgow? Sure, but only if he does his homework. • Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the managing director of Climate Analytics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-04T16:30:26Z","webTitle":"Running homes and cars on electricity alone would save households $5,443 a year, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Running homes and cars on electricity alone would save households $5,443 a year, report finds","bodyText":"What would you do with an extra $5,443 a year? Converting all home appliances and cars to run on electricity could eliminate a third of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028, according to a new report. The report, Castles and Cars, by the new energy thinktank Rewiring Australia, found the average Australian household uses 102kWh of energy a day at a cost of $5,248 a year. Much of this cost comes from relying on petrol and gas to power cars, stoves, showers and heaters. The report said internal combustion engines in cars were only 30% efficient in converting petrol or diesel to power, while water heaters relying on natural gas used three times as much energy as those using a heat pump – the same technology that runs refrigerators and air conditions. In electricity generation, many coal plants reach an efficiency of only 30% while natural gas plants reach 45% efficiency. Replacing fossil fuel appliances and vehicles with electric models by 2030, and powering them with increasingly efficient cheap solar energy, could save households $5,443 a year and cut household emissions to zero, the report states. It said Australia was uniquely positioned to electrify households due to its population density, capacity for renewable energy generation and existing state and territory policies. Saul Griffith, an Australian who has advised the Biden administration on energy policy and the report’s author, said taking the best existing policies from each state and combining them with federal leadership would allow Australia to put together a comprehensive framework and “show the world how it’s done”. “Australia is a lot closer to doing this than the general country thinks,” Griffith said. “If we go first, we’ll be selling those technologies to California. If we don’t go first they’ll be selling them to us.” He said the first step would be a pilot program to retrofit every building in a suburb. It would become a template that could be refined before being rolled out elsewhere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, developed in partnership with the Australia Institute, will be launched on Tuesday by Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. Matt Kean, the New South Wales energy and environment minister, who is expected to soon become treasurer, was due to join the launch before Gladys Berejiklian resigned as NSW premier on Friday. Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the report was a good news story. “It reduces the solutions to climate change to a simple narrative: get to 100% clean energy, electrify everything and then turn your carbon sources into carbon sinks,” he said. Suggestions in the report included offering rebates and finance to help low-income households switch to electricity and ensure access to solar power and battery storage as a “national priority”. It would involve programs similar to the Victorian government’s solar homes program – which aims to electrify appliances in low-income households – being expanded nationally. D’Ambrosio said the Victorian government was developing a “gas substitution roadmap” that would “chart a long-term plan to decarbonise gas usage”. “Electrification offers incredible opportunities to help us reach Victoria’s target of halving emissions by 2030,” she said. Nicky Ison, energy transition manager with WWF Australia, was not involved with the report but said it was “incredibly compelling”. “One of the problems we have when we talk about climate change and the energy transition is a lot of the focus 15-years-ago was about personal sacrifice,” Ison said. “We’ve now moved from a climate narrative based on austerity to one based on abundance and opportunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-21T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","fields":{"headline":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","bodyText":"Renewable energy and low-carbon heating could do much more to alleviate the gas supply problems of the future – and could have done much to reduce the impact of this winter’s soaring gas prices, if the government had done more to shift the UK’s energy market sooner, industry experts have said. The gas supply crunch has prompted a flurry of government meetings with industry, and reassurances in parliament on Monday from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, that “there is no question of the lights going out” and that the UK is “highly resilient”. But the supply issue demonstrates that fossil fuels are inherently subject to wild price fluctuations, which happen at least once a decade, according to Roger Fouquet, of the London School of Economics. “Price volatility is an inevitable part of the fossil fuel energy system,” he said. “Renewables do not suffer from these market-related problems.” Switching to renewables reduces the impact of fossil fuel price fluctuation, but the UK is still “particularly exposed to international gas prices”, said Rob Gross of UCL. “Gas power stations set prices [in the UK], particularly when demand is high and renewables output is low. Countries with a lower share of gas in their power mix experience less volatile prices and we should expect that here too.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents wind energy companies, said the government should learn the lesson for future years. “The first priority for government and the sector is, of course, protecting consumers in response to this price surge. The only way to do that in the long term is to have an energy system powered by cheap renewables, with flexible storage, hydrogen and other low-carbon technologies to meet demand at lowest cost.” He pointed out that it was already cheaper, even before the gas price began soaring, to generate electricity by building a new windfarm than running an existing gas power plant. The growth of renewables has cut the proportion of power the UK gets from fossil fuels from 60% to under 40% in the last few years. McGrail said: “The industry is working with government to accelerate investment in renewables, which is key to ending our reliance on gas for heating our homes and in heavy industries. Alongside massive investment in renewables, we need to shift the dial on electrification and green hydrogen production in the UK to meet net zero at lowest cost.” Solar power has also plummeted in cost in recent years, despite a lack of support from the government, and is forecast to be the cheapest form of power within a few years, surpassing even onshore windfarms. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade body Solar Energy UK, said solar power could continue to provide electricity through the winter months. Solar currently provides about 4.5% of the UK’s electricity, but he said it was “eminently achievable” to triple that by 2030, at no cost to consumers, if the government would clear the way by removing regulatory difficulties. Heat pumps for homes could also reduce the UK’s reliance on gas, added Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, as they run on electricity, though electricity in the UK is partly generated by gas. “But even if all of the electricity used by heat pumps was generated by gas the much higher efficiency of heat pumps would still result in a reduction of gas use.” However, as Fouquet notes, “wind and solar do suffer from intermittency problems. So, while accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources is welcome for environmental reasons, it is important to develop an energy system that is flexible to these intermittencies.” That can involve investing in large-scale battery storage technologies, which the UK has signally failed to do, or in backup power. Nuclear reactors, though controversial, can supply a steady stream of power to the grid that can counterbalance the intermittency of some renewable energy, but plans by successive governments for more than two decades to build a new fleet of reactors that would replace the UK’s current ageing nuclear plants have been mired in difficulties. The trade union Prospect called on the government to beef up its commitment to nuclear power. Sue Ferns, senior deputy secretary general of the union, said: “This is a wake-up call for the government, which must intervene immediately to ensure short-term security of supply. The current crisis is a product of an over-reliance on imports and weather-dependent renewables leaving us dangerously exposed to fluctuations in global natural-gas markets. The UK must prioritise domestic sources of firm power, particularly nuclear, to ensure a secure, resilient and low-carbon future.” Another vital measure is to reduce the amount of energy that is wasted. British homes are among the draughtiest and least efficient in Europe, but little has been done to improve that. The government introduced an insulation scheme, the green homes grant, last year as part of its much-vaunted push to “build back greener” from the pandemic. Within six months, however, it had all but collapsed owing to poor administration and in March this year it was scrapped by the Treasury, with nothing to replace it. After the current crisis has passed, it will be tempting for ministers to return to normal. But experts contacted by the Guardian warned that this should be a wakeup call to the government to introduce the suite of measures needed to protect the UK’s gas supply and shift the economy to a low-carbon footing. Gross concluded: “Ultimately, it will depend on the level of storage, interconnection and demand management to make best use of renewable resources and break the link between gas and power prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-20T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"‘The potential for solar is huge’: future looks bright for Lightsource BP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","fields":{"headline":"‘The potential for solar is huge’: future looks bright for Lightsource BP","bodyText":"Nick Boyle, the founder and chief executive of solar power giant Lightsource BP, is striding through its central London headquarters speaking as quickly as he walks. It takes a lot of energy for one man to make a sprawling office emptied by Covid-19 feel alive, but the Irishman has more than enough for the job. It is less than a year since the oil corporation BP, the venture’s joint-owner, thrust it into the spotlight by unveiling plans to grow its renewable energy generation 20-fold within this decade. Now Boyle is poised to set out how Lightsource will help power one of the biggest corporate transformations ever attempted. “We knew that the interest in solar and renewables was going to rise. But not even in my wildest dreams would I have assumed that it was going to rise at the pace that it has,” Boyle says. The former financial services executive founded the company, then known as Lightsource Renewable Energy, at the end of 2010 with five employees and a solar farm in Truro, Cornwall, capable of generating enough electricity to power 430 homes. Within seven years Boyle had grown the company to a team of 300, with solar farms in Ireland, Netherlands, India and the US – catching the eye of major players hoping to buy into the solar boom. It was at the end of 2017 that the oil giant’s acquisition of 43% of the company, now rebranded as Lightsource BP, was agreed. Two years later that stake was increased to create the 50:50 joint venture in place today. “The word ‘symbiosis’ seems to be used to describe the relationship we have with BP, and I think that’s a very fair description’,” Boyle says. It was a deal that helped make Lightsource one of the fastest growing solar companies in the world, and provided BP with the clean-energy testbed it needed to propose one of the greatest transformation plans in corporate history. The venture has tripled its global reach to 15 countries, and doubled its workforce from 300 in 2017 to around 600 staff across its global portfolio today. Lightsource BP’s initial goal was to use the oil giant’s financial muscle to grow a 1.6 gigawatt pipeline of solar projects to a portfolio of 10GW of solar investments by 2023. “We didn’t sit back and plan to deliver 10GW; we realised at some point the question would be asked: ‘Have you got the capability to do more?’” Boyle says. Since then BP has brought in a new CEO, Bernard Looney, and discovered a renewed appetite for renewable energy. The new target is now for Lightsource BP to more than double its planned solar rollout, to 25GW by 2025. “One of things that we’ve done really well in the first years in partnership with BP is that we’ve set aggressive targets and we’ve delivered on every one them … They were able to believe us when we said: ‘Guys, 10GW isn’t really pushing the envelope.’ That was the start of the conversation about how we redefine what ‘good’ looks like,” Boyle says. Solar energy is expected to play a crucial role in helping BP meet its 2030 renewable energy target because solar farms can be rolled out far quicker than its plans to build offshore wind farms by the second half of the decade. As well as Lightsource’s facilities, BP also plans to finance its own solar farms which the solar venture will develop and run as a “gun for hire”. “We already have momentum,” Boyle says. “The fact that we are able to deliver with confidence allows BP to believe that their early 2025 [interim target] is actually doable predominantly through solar, and that’s important to them.” This confidence is also important to BP’s shareholders, many of whom remain sceptical that the financial returns from renewable energy can compete with the cash generated from barrels of crude. “This is always an amusing one for me,” Boyle says. “People who compare the returns on solar with oil and gas miss the fact that they’re comparing an apple to a fish.” Boyle was drawn to the solar industry from a background in retail financial services, “selling a little bit to a lot of people”, because he recognised solar power’s long-term predictable returns as the “Holy Grail of small volume investments”. “We know that the sun will come up and the sun will go down so we’re essentially creating an annuity of very predictable generation multiplied by a fixed price that has already been agreed with some of the largest companies in the world.” Lightsource BP earlier this month struck a deal to build the largest solar farm in the US state of Louisiana to supply clean energy to McDonald’s and eBay. It has also agreed a deal to supply electricity to Amazon from an existing solar farm in Ohio, and to supply power to BP service stations from solar farms in New South Wales, Australia. “That’s a very different bet to digging a hole and wondering whether you’ll hit gas or oil, and how much, and what it’ll cost to get it out, and what the market price will be when you get it out,” he says. By the same analogy investing in solar would be “like digging a hole and knowing how much oil is there, how much it will cost and how much you’ll be paid for it before you start”, Boyle says. The solar industry is not without its challenges. Earlier this year reports emerged that some of China’s biggest solar companies may have ties to Uyghur forced-labour camps in Xinjiang via polysilicon production. Ongoing US sanctions against China’s solar supply chain threaten to raise costs, and slow the pace of the industry globally. Lightsource BP was one of the companies that sourced their panels and components from the companies linked to Xinjiang, albeit prior to 2016 when the state-sanctioned abuse of Uyghur communities began to gain international attention. Boyle says the company is ready to meet these challenges “head on”. Lightsource has not used Chinese-made solar panels “for years now” due to the US sanctions, and is working with industry groups across its geographical portfolio to help improve the “traceability” of the solar supply chain. “At the end of the day there shouldn’t be a trade-off between the advantages of renewables and the disadvantages of individuals being put through hardship,” he says. There’s no slowing down solar, he says. In the future, demand for solar electricity will be fuelled by two things: the boom in low-cost batteries that mean solar can be used at any time, and the desire to produce green hydrogen – made from renewable electricity and water – which will mean solar will effectively be used anywhere from sea to train to plane. “Hydrogen could be shipped around the world as an energy source which essentially came from the sun but is captured as a gas, and burned the same way as historic hydrocarbons,” Boyle says. “The future in hydrogen alone makes the 25GW target look small. The potential for solar is absolutely huge.” The potential for Lightsource BP appears to be just as bright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/sep/13/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-fridtjof-nansen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-13T10:07:18Z","webTitle":"Rain fell on Greenland's ice sheet for the first time ever known.

Alarms should ring","bodyText":"Many people believed he couldn’t do it. Ski across the Greenland ice sheet, a vast, unmapped, high-elevation plateau of ice and snow? Madness. But Fridtjof Nansen, a young Norwegian, proved them wrong. In 1888, he and his small party went light and fast, unlike two large expeditions a few years before. And unlike the others, Nansen traveled from east to west, giving himself no option of retreat to a safe base. It would be forward or die trying. He did it in seven weeks, man-hauling his supplies and ascending to 8,900ft (2,700 meters) elevation, where summertime temperatures dropped to -49F (-45C). That was then. This is now: Last month, for the first time in recorded history, rain fell on the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet. It hardly made the news. But rain in a place historically defined by bitter cold portends a future that will alter coastlines around the world, and drown entire cities. The Greenland ice sheet contains four times more ice than all of Earth’s other glaciers and ice fields combined, outside Antarctica. The largest island in the world, Greenland is more than 36,000 times the size of Manhattan, and ice covers most of it, in many places thousands of feet thick. As carbon dioxide and methane accumulate in our atmosphere, causing our planet to heat (the six warmest years on record have been the last six), the ice sheet disintegrates. Greenland lost more ice in the past decade than it did in the previous century. Massive summertime meltwater rivers now flow over the ice sheet where, in Nansen’s time, no signs of surface water could be found. If the people of Miami, Shanghai, Tokyo, Mumbai, Lagos, Bangkok and New York are not concerned, they should be. The great Greenland ice melt is a climate crisis sword of Damocles for all coastal, low-lying, densely populated areas. No other single factor will probably contribute more to sea level rise over the next few decades. A consortium of climate scientists writing two years ago in Nature, a prestigious scientific journal, concluded that if Greenland continues to melt, in one bad-case scenario after another, tens of millions of people could be in danger of yearly flooding and displacement by 2030 – less than nine years from now. And by the end of this century, when Antarctica, which contains vastly more ice than Greenland, also enters a phase of catastrophic melting, the number of annual flood-prone people could reach nearly half a billion. It’s more than farewell, Miami. It’s goodbye, Florida. The assumption that land will always last is no longer valid. “Land is about the only thing that cannot fly away,” the English novelist Anthony Trollope once observed. True. But it can go bone dry – or drown. After Nansen’s Greenland expedition, he oversaw the construction of a small wooden ship named Fram (“Forward”), designed to enter the Arctic pack ice in an attempt to reach the north pole. Later, he mentored the explorers Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. His final act, however, was his most inspiring. As high commissioner for refugees for the League of Nations, he devised a passport to repatriate thousands left homeless after the Great War, and was awarded the 1922 Nobel peace prize. Nansen did what humankind must now do. He transcended himself. He respected science, and cared deeply for others. In the face of great challenges today, we can – and must – do the same. A good example is Jason Box, who Jeff Goodell, in his 2017 book The Water Will Come, describes as “a maverick scientist and Greenland ice junkie who got a lot of attention in 2012 when he publicly predicted just weeks before the summer melt season that Greenland would experience a record-breaking year for ice melt”. Raised and educated in Colorado, Box suspected that soot from wildfires in the American west and Canada, and from coal-fired power plants in the industrial north, would enter the atmosphere and travel far. When it settled in Greenland, the soot would darken the ice sheet and make it absorb, not reflect, solar energy. The result: the ice sheet would melt like gangbusters. Which is exactly what has happened. In 2014, Box was stunned to find the ice sheet so dark. He has since said that humanity’s burning of fossil fuels has probably set in motion nearly 70ft of sea level rise. A bold prediction, and not out of character for Box, who has spent more than a year on the ice. “I like ice because it’s nature’s thermometer,” he told Goodell. “It’s not political. As the world heats up, ice melts, it’s simple. It’s the kind of science that everyone can understand.” While science, endeavoring to avoid alarmism, can be overly cautious, science isn’t the problem. Disinformation and a lack of political will are the problems. To save the Greenland ice sheet – and Florida – will require a Nansen-esque transformation on steroids, something inspired by, but much larger than, President Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. To begin, we need to elect representatives who respect science, and accept the magnitude of what we’re up against. If they do not, they must be defeated. It’s time to put our planet first. A little more than a thousand years ago, back when the world seemed large and wondrous and unknown, the Vikings settled Greenland. For every one person alive on earth back then, there are 25 today, most of us trapped in a fossil fuel economy that has given us great prosperity but now must be replaced. By what? By trains powered by wind, trucks powered by the sun, highways made of solar panels. Fantasy? No, they already exist. And are just the beginning. We are all on Greenland’s ice sheet with Nansen now. It’s forward or fail. No turning back.

Asked on the ABC’s Radio National whether NSW could meet a UN call for wealthy countries to phase out coal by 2030, Matt Kean said it could, pointing to the state plan to build 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage that was passed by parliament with multi-party support last year. He said the federally backed Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project would also help. “We absolutely can meet the target,” he said. “We have the biggest renewable energy plan that has been legislated in the nation’s history right here in NSW and that means as our coal-fired power plants reach the end of their lives over the next decade they will be replaced with renewables.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW gets nearly 70% of its electricity from burning black coal. The state has five coal-fired plants, only two of which – Liddell and Vales Point – are officially scheduled to close this decade. Kean’s comment suggests he believes the other three – including the Mount Piper plant, which is not scheduled to close until 2043 – will stop operating much earlier than planned. It is consistent with analyses that have found coal plants across the country may shut early as they were increasingly being priced out of the market by cheap solar energy. Not for the first time, Kean’s position appears at odds with the federal energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has backed an Energy Security Board recommendation to introduce a “capacity market” to ensure there is enough “dispatchable” energy – power that can be called on when needed – available to support variable renewable energy sources. Taylor has said the capacity market would be “technology neutral”, but could help keep existing generators – coal – “from shutting down too early”. Kean said last month he was “carefully examining” the ESB advice to ensure its proposals worked alongside the state’s plans to substantially increase renewable generation and new sources of dispatchable generation, such as pumped hydro and batteries, and would not increase costs for consumers. Kean also told the ABC he and the board of the Environment Protection Authority had accepted a judgment by the state’s land and environment court last month that the agency had a duty to develop objectives, policies and guidelines to protect the environment from climate change. It was the first time a court found an Australian government agency was failing in its duty to address global heating and must take action to address greenhouse gas emissions. It followed a legal challenge by the group Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action. Kean said he wanted to use “all the levers within government” to do what the court found was necessary. “We’ll be doing everything necessary to give that full effect,” he said. Kean was asked about reports this week that the Australian government had pressed the UK to remove specific climate targets from a trade deal. He said pressure was mounting on Australia “from our trusted friends and allies” to do more on the climate crisis. “It is starting to impact on our ability to trade into international markets and grow our economy,” he said. “For too long, Australian politicians have been complaining about the cost of taking action on climate change, but now we’re seeing the very real prospect of very significant costs from not taking action on climate change because those countries that are taking strong action – like the UK, like [member countries of] the EU, like the United States – they all do not want their efforts on decarbonisation to be in vain.” The UN’s assistant secretary general for climate action and special adviser to the secretary general, Selwin Hart, warned in a speech on Monday that the climate crisis would “wreak havoc” across the Australian economy if coal was not rapidly phased out. Kean said Australia was experiencing climate change through worsening bushfires and more severe droughts, but there were more “enormous opportunities” in job creation if governments acted to address the issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
