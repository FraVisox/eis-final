Standing at the apex of Edinburgh's pink triangle, around 30 underdressed partygoers queue for up to 15 minutes to get into one of the city's most popular gay nightclubs. But when dawn broke on Sunday the Catholic faithful assembled across the road at St Mary's cathedral, to hear the reveller's lifestyle condemned from the pulpit in a statement read out by Scotland's eight Catholic bishops. The battle over the decision to repeal section 28, which forbids local councils \"to promote homosexuality\" in schools, has been more intense in Scotland than anywhere else in Great Britain. For the past fortnight the issue has scarcely been off the front pages of the Scottish press, which has devoted entire letters pages to the issue, quoting every thing from Nelson Mandela to Leviticus. On Sunday, millionaire businessman Brian Souter, who has donated Â£500,000 to a campaign to keep the section, threatened \"poll tax style\" demonstrations against the Scottish parliament if it pushes ahead with its plans for repeal. The basic faultlines of the debate are identical to those in England - a mixture of ignorance and bigotry masquerading as populist conservatism, pitched against a small minority backed by the political class. But the row in Scotland goes beyond section 28. Despite all the column inches, nobody seriously believes that the Labour-Liberal coalition which runs the Scottish parliament is likely to go back on its word. What we are seeing is Scotland's key players jockeying for position as they square up to establish their credentials as the nation's political culture finds new expression in a devolved parliament. Nowhere is this truer than with the Catholic church - last week its leader, Cardinal Thomas Winning, described homosexuality as a \"perversion\" - which is desperate to make its mark on the new political landscape. Catholics are a minority in Scotland but retain a powerful voice with the labour movement. Whatever their denomination, Scots take their religion far more seriously than the English. Even though, as in England, church attendance is declining, Scots remain almost twice as likely to attend church as the English, according to Christian research. And the church's influence is not confined to Sundays. On weekdays, religion segregates many schools, and on Saturdays it is likely to determine which football team you support - Celtic are known as the Pope's XI. Scotland's liberal establishment thought it was was well on the way to establishing a progressive consensus to the left of Tony Blair, akin to the Scandinavian model. But in the absence of credible Conservative opposition it is now finding itself in head-on collision with a church which is claiming an influence similar to the Polish clergy, as the principle vehicle for social reaction. The campaign to keep the clause had a huge impact on the debate in Westminster. Before the furore in Scotland the issue had only surfaced as an example of William Hague's \"rightwing extremism\" after his opposition to repeal sent Shaun Woodward into the hands of Labour. Now it has re-emerged as a mainstream issue which is causing tension within Blair's cabinet. Last week, after the prime minister hinted that he might allow a free vote on the issue, the front page of the Scotsman proclaimed that the \"tail was now wagging the dog\". Blair eventually backtracked but the precedent had already been established - middle England was following middle Scotland's lead. It is the most potent example yet of how devolution is set to transform political dialogue both between the nations of the United Kingdom and within them. Politics may be the art of the possible. But with the emergence of new parliaments and assemblies, drawing on their own distinctive political traditions, come the green shoots of new possiblities that are no longer so easy to dismiss. If Labour can find a way to ensure that Scottish students only pay their tuition fees after graduation, then why can they not do it in the rest of the UK? If they can ban fox hunting there, why not here? And London and Wales are going their own way as well. The row in Scotland over section 28 shows that these new devolved entites do not necessarily contribute to a more progressive national consensus - but they do provide forums for political and economic strategies not only to be discussed but enacted. They represent not only a fractured nation state but the disintegration of a national dogma. They show that there are only so many times you can keep saying \"There is no alternative,\" before it starts sounding like petulance rather than pragmatism - especially when there clearly is an answer a few hundred miles up the A1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/feb/02/tvandradio.television1","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-02T01:33:22Z","webTitle":"Big is beautiful","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/feb/02/tvandradio.television1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/feb/02/tvandradio.television1","fields":{"headline":"Big is beautiful","bodyText":"While Sky's top execs were busy sharpening their movie know-how at the Sundance Film Festival last week, back home their relations with the UK's indie film scene had taken a knock. The makers of Sky Pictures' bio-pic of 60s footballing hero George Best won a High Court injunction, preventing Sky from broadcasting the film. At least, until cinema-goers get a chance to see it first. After months of wrangling, producer Mary McGuckian and her actor husband John Lynch (who plays Best) have got three months to sign with a distributor and get it into the multiplexes - after that, Sky is free to show it on Sky Premier as planned. To the outside world, Best had looked like a mainstay in the first slate of UK films Sky was teeing up for \"release\" on Premier. Using the model of US pay-channel HBO (which carries no advertising and the slogan \"it's not TV, it's HBO\"), Sky wanted to create a prestige channel where discerning subscribers could get the very best of new British. Other films off the blocks with Best included the Brit-Pack Tube Tales, with strands directed by Ewan McGregor and Bob Hoskins, black comedy Milk, starring Dawn French and James Fleet, and the upcoming Saving Grace with Brenda Blethyn. All were described as \"feature films\" - nicely side-stepping the made-for-TV label - and they were being made by film (rather than TV) writers, directors and producers who could then sell them theatrically overseas. Never one to turn down money, the British film industry welcomed the cash-injection; as Best producer McGuckian says, \"it looked like a positive proposition\". Behind the scenes, though, her film was already starting to rock the Pictures-Premier boat. Whereas Sky had full control of most of its films commissioned for Premier (on TV and at the cinema), a smaller stake in Best meant it only had a say in what happened on UK TV. Eager to stay at helm of the film's destiny, the film makers had passed up their fees so they could hang on to cinema rights. They wanted their film to go to the big screen first, while Sky was committed to its subscribers. But there's little patience to be found when a film tries to work the awkward line between cinema and TV. If it airs on TV and then later tries for a cinema release it's forever tainted by the \"TV film\" tag, and if there's a film on TV that film-goers don't recognise as having made it to the cinemas, it doesn't have the feature film kudos and is dismissed as \"made-for-TV\" or \"straight-to-video\". Despite these unwritten rules, with McGuckian still pushing to get Best in the cinemas and Sky not wanting to break its Sky Premier first policy, the idea of a simultaneous release was hatched. Sky Premier would get to broadcast the film once during the opening weekend at the cinemas, in exchange for backing the cinema release. McGuckian even had a distributor interested. But with tradition against it, the idea wasn't destined to last long. Exhibitors are always going to be at best frosty to a film that's on TV (even if it is only once) at the same time that it's showing in their cinemas. After all, it's the current release pattern (cinema, video, TV) that fuels the box office and keeps them in jobs. Sky's ambition to make Premier Britain's answer to HBO quickly moved beyond original films anyway. Big-budget drama series like The Tenth Kingdom, from the writer of TV's Gulliver's Travels, and The Stretch, reuniting ex-EastEnders duo Anita Dobson and Leslie Grantham, were being lined up, while David Baddiel was given the go-ahead on a new sitcom. And these were to fill a hole in Premier's content which opened up with news that sister-company and distributor 20th Century Fox wanted to put \"selected\" Sky Pictures into UK cinemas - before the Sky Premier premiere. Putting some producers out of their misery with the chance of a cinema outing, but looking like a volte-face on Sky's part, the change of plan was shrugged off with \"as we evolve, our strategy evolves\". (Not fast enough, however, to let Best into the new theatrical loop and off a TV airing...) The big question now, though, is whether Sky can sustain a premier premiere channel while it hands over the first-run of its movies to the cinema and, at the same time, looks like losing its entertainment and drama to Sky One - which is upping the ante as it prepares for battle with Channel 4's entertainment channel E4. Channel 4 is looking fierce, having snatched first-run Friends and ER from Sky One, so it's predicted that the likes of The Stretch and Baddiel's show will move across to bolster the channel. Talk of Sky Premier's commissions being swiped is naturally being played down by Sky, with promises of re-doubling commitment to home-grown shows on Sky One. Either way, with multi-channel viewers increasingly impatient at the constant rebranding and repositioning of niche stations, it had better make up its mind soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/feb/02/efinance.internet","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-02T17:01:51Z","webTitle":"Shock exchange","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/feb/02/efinance.internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/feb/02/efinance.internet","fields":{"headline":"Shock exchange","bodyText":"Stock markets: once it was top hats, blue buttons and Black Mondays; Eton meets the East End. Now it is denims, \"day\" traders and dotcoms. Technology is changing how dealing is conducted. A once cosy world faces a revolution. Traditional players are having to fight nimbler rivals. Even relative newcomers in the derivatives markets - not so long ago at the cutting edge of financial market development - are having to bow to change. On London's International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traders have hung up their garishly striped jackets and quit the manic, noisy pits of the old trading floor in the City of London for quieter quarters in places such as Islington. The changes are affecting the big financial institutions which trade billions of pounds worth of shares a year and small investors alike. One casualty could be British government revenue in the shape of stamp duty. At 0.5% it is higher in the United Kingdom than in other European financial centres. In the days of defined national markets the relative higher cost of doing business in London was not a crucial factor. But it could become one in the new technology driven environment. Hence this week's initiative from the Stock Exchange to get rid of the tax, with the argument that the government would benefit from higher yields from capital gains tax. Traditionally stock exchanges allowed companies to offer investors their shares. They listed the standards companies had to meet to be granted a quotation. They supervised, making sure everyone played by the rules when shares were traded. Market professionals were intermediaries and in London one group, market makers, put up their own capital to facilitate trading. Technology has changed all that. Trading floors, physical embodiment of the market, have been replaced by networks of computers; investors sit in offices using banks of screens both as a source of information and a mechanism for dealing. Walking into a dealing room now is like entering Dixons and seeing all the television screens showing Teletext. That did not matter as long as the established stock exchanges still controlled the new electronic trading networks. But alternatives aplenty are springing up, rivals such as London's Tradepoint and Easdaq, a Brussels-based exchange aiming to replicate the success of Nasdaq in the United States, listing such companies as Microsoft and Dell. Groups of big investors, investment banks and fund managers are finding new ways to trade. They are backing alternative trading \"platforms\" where at set times every day an investor who want to unload a block of shares in one company can explore, electronically and anonymously, whether there is another institution prepared to buy. A combination of globalisation, technology and the advent of the euro have made institutions hungry to trade across borders and jurisdictions. City-based investors, including American and Japanese houses for which the Square Mile is their European base, want to trade in the shares of (say) German or French companies as easily as they can in British ones. The established European exchanges spotted the danger and for the past 18 months have been planning an eight-member alliance. Progress has been slow. Old rivalries die hard. Ownership of the exchanges has proved a problem, too. The London Stock Exchange is demutualising - switching from being owned by its members to a corporate structure. Frankfurt is pondering changes to allow foreign members a greater say in what is happening. The French bourse has already demutualised and is now planning to list itself. The threat of invasion by Nasdaq (which plans to launch its own European trading scheme later this year) is another spur. Frankfurt has sought, successfully, to be competitive in attracting hi-tech companies to its Neuer Markt. Paris has just listed its first pure dot com company. London has its techMark. For small investors technology has arrived in the form of the internet. Even those who would never be described as seriously rich are being wooed. Share dealing via the internet is booming. The number of internet share deals hit 371,000 in the last quarter of 1999 - more than double the previous quarter's figure. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers calculates there are now more than 100,000 on-line accounts; it expects the internet to account for almost one in five of all execution-only trades by the end of March. The American phenomenon of the \"day trader\" is arriving here. While most small investors are content to either squirrel away a modest portfolio as a form of saving and others seek to dip in and out of the market from time to time, day traders look to make money through dealing heavily and rapidly every day. In the UK Deal4free.com provides a service which allows those with the money and the nerve to trade share price movements, rather than the shares themselves. As use of the internet grows more effort will be made to promote services to attract yet more retail investors. The number of UK brokers offering online dealing trebled in the past year. Big investors have already discovered competition gives the customer more clout. Small investors may get the same message. â¢ Mark Milner is the Guardian's deputy financial editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/feb/03/features11.g21","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-03T02:01:29Z","webTitle":"A bridge too far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/feb/03/features11.g21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/feb/03/features11.g21","fields":{"headline":"A bridge too far","bodyText":"There was a slight problem with the diplomatic vehicle. The white Mercedes - a vintage model a few decades old - wasn't moving. It was propped up precariously on a pile of bricks but was still replete with tyres; the rust made it clear the only place the Merc was going was to pot. Not to be put off by mere trifles such as a wrecked car - which in times of crisis also doubles as the diplomatic residence - we arrange to meet the statesman-cum-legal-warrior in his village. Dunvegan is to be found at the not-so-pretty north-west corner of Skye: it's the village that coach tours pass through on the way to the castle, though the less upmarket ones occasionally stop off at the shabby hotel. For the moment, it is also the home of Robbie the Pict, founder of the state of Pictland of Alba, and, as far as the Scottish executive and anyone with even a passing connection to the Skye bridge is concerned, the biggest pain in the arse to descend from the Highlands since accordion music. Robbie the Pict presents many problems - not least being how you address him: Mr Pict, Mr The Pict or just plain Robbie? But it's the one-time roadie' s obsession with the minutiae of British constitutional law and the lump of concrete and steel which joins Skye to the mainland that offers the greatest pique to all those concerned with such matters. Shortly before Christmas, Robbie lost a long-running appeal about the legitimacy of toll collection on the Skye bridge. As always, he represented himself in court. Robbie may be self-taught, but he is experienced in all things legal. So far, on the matter of the bridge alone, he has represented himself in 56 court cases. In theory, there are another 53 cases to come. There's also the small matter of organising the defence of around 400 other people. And plans to mount yet more legal challenges. It is hard to put an exact figure on it, but the tall Highlander with the ginger hair and tweed cap must have cost the various tiers of British government several hundred thousand pounds in legal fees. And even more in annoyance. Along with the continuous court challenges on every possible detail of the bridge, Robbie refuses to pay tax, he has prosecuted the English crown for reset (handling stolen property) and he drives around - when the Merc is not propped up on bricks, that is - in a car with diplomatic number plates and a tax disc registered to Pictland of Alba. There are legal justifications for all these actions, but, when they're found insufficient by courts - and it happens frequently - he happily goes to prison. Then he thinks of some other ground to fight from. \"Being a pain in the arse is not a factor that I am mindful of at all,\" he says, straight faced. \"You can sit and say, 'I would rather drink beer', or you can take responsibility, do what you can do, and it only takes one guy in a court.\" Since the early 80s, Robbie has frequently been that guy. To the rest of us, his initial motivation may seem a little bizarre, but, to the monotonously serious Robbie, it fanned the flames of ancient anger. The one-man legal crusade began with the passing of the British nationality act 1981. Not, all things considered, the most contentious piece of Tory legislation (even internet search engines can only find one mention of it, and that's information on how to buy it). But the act changed the national status of Scots from subjects of the kingdom of Scotland to citizens of the Westminster parliament. This made Robbie rather angry. He began mounting his invariably well-researched, if occasionally unlikely, legal challenges. To help him on his way, a solicitor friend on Skye gave Robbie an acre of land to act as base camp for his constitutional crusade. He declared it Pictland of Alba, the Pictish free state. That was just the start. \"I stopped responding to any tax demands and road-tax demands. I registered my vehicle with Pictland of Alba, Rigg, Skye,\" he says. \"I had my own road-tax disc and I put diplomatic plates on the car, for a bit of fun.\" There were plenty, though, who were not exactly amused by Robbie's peculiar wheeze. On the face of it, it appears to be just a blatant attempt to wind up the authorities. But Robbie claims it is an example of the situationism apparently practised by Dutch peasants (it seemed best not to demand further explanation). Shortly after registering his car to Pictland of Alba, he began parking it on double-yellow lines across Edinburgh. Nothing happened; no ticket appeared. Undeterred, he continued parking the car illegally but, after six weeks, still there was nothing. For those who know Edinburgh, this is immediately apparent as nothing short of a miracle: it was obvious that either ethereal forces were involved, or Pictland had been given diplomatic recognition. It was not until Robbie made a trip to Perth a few days later that things started to go a bit wrong, or, for Robbie at least, have the desired intention. While driving through the town, he was stopped by a local policeman. The bobby was mildly amused by Robbie's tales of Pictland, but he phoned through to check the diplomatic number plates. They were the same as those used by the Nigerian embassy. Robbie was arrested for, among other things, impersonating a Nigerian diplomat. \"I went to Perth sheriff court and then to the high court. I was fined but I didn't pay so I went to prison for 40 days,\" he says with discomfiting nonchalance. \"Jail is just an occupational hazard if you decide to take on imperialism.\" His crusades have supplied him with numerous criminal convictions, but, in 1994, Robbie tried to return the favour to the home office. He began a prosecution of the English crown for reset over the stone of destiny. But, 24 hours before the case was due to be heard on July 13, 1997, the stone was on its way back to Scotland. Maybe it was coincidence. Robbie's next big legal preoccupation began in 1995 - and continues to this day: the Skye bridge. When, in October of that year, Skye was joined to mainland Britain for the first time in thousands of years, the locals did not take kindly to the costs. Tolls to cross the bridge - built under the hugely controversial private finance initiative and currently owned by the Bank of America - were fairly hefty. (Now they are levied at a much-reduced level of Â£4.70 each way.) So the islanders, led by Robbie, began a campaign of non-payment. This, though, was not the usual island revolt. The campaign group, Skat, didn't want a political solution; only a legal one would do. Around 400 people were charged with a criminal offence for refusing to pay the toll. The campaign group managed to get 270 off not guilty. The sheriff court in Dingwall has been overrun with cases ever since. Alongside this have been other legal challenges from Robbie: from the legitimacy of collection methods to upsetting the Act of Union. And he has also reported the bridge's operators to the VAT man (although, ironically, the EU is now planning to add VAT to tolls). So far, it's been to no avail. But he is undeterred. \"I am attempting to expose what I think is one of the biggest examples of across-the-board criminal and government corruption,\" he says. In between this, he has stood for the Scottish parliament. He had to sell his caravan to make the Â£500 deposit, so he lived in the diplomatic car for a while. But that was an aside. It's the bridge that annoys and obsesses him. \"This will go on through generations. My kids will carry on,\" he says, before going off to prepare more legal work. Even Perry Mason wasn't this committed - or bizarre."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"books/2000/feb/04/seamusheaney","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-04T14:39:09Z","webTitle":"Beowulf translated by Seamus Heaney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/04/seamusheaney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/feb/04/seamusheaney","fields":{"headline":"Beowulf translated by Seamus Heaney","bodyText":"Hrothgar, son of Halfdene, was favoured in war, and ordered men to build a great mead hall. It was named Heorot, but a grim demon, Grendel was his name, a descendent of Cain, a God-cursed brute, struck the hall again and again, grabbed men and butchered their corpses. One day from across the sea, Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, came from the land of the Geats, owing allegiance to Lord Hygelac, to help fight this grim demon. Unferth, son of Ecglaf, being contrary said: \"Are you the Beowulf who took on Breca in a swimming match on the open sea, risking the water just to prove you could win?\" Beowulf, Ecgtheow's son, replied, \"Friend, you're letting the beer do the talking. The truth is this, I'm a strong swimmer, and although it wore me out I landed safe. I cannot recall any fight you entered, Unferth, son of Ecglaf, that bears comparison, not that I'm boasting.\" God-cursed Grendel came, but Beowulf was granted the power of winning, and Grendel gave a God-cursed scream. No one regretted his fatal departure. Grendel's mother, monstrous hell-bride, came for revenge. Alas, Aeschere, Yremenlaf's elder brother and Hrothgar's soul-mate, was killed. Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, promised to avenge the death. The hero went to the lairs of water-monsters, observed that swamp-thing from hell, a lifeless corpse. Beowulf cut the corpse's head off. Hrothgar, elated, praised the Geat: \"Oh flower of warriors, do not give way to pride. Choose eternal rewards.\" And so, the grey-haired Dane, the high-born king, kissed Beowulf, gave him gifts, and Beowulf, glorious in his gold regalia, journeyed home. Fifty years passed, as time does. The wide kingdom, reverted to Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow. He ruled well, until the treasure of a dragon, was disturbed. The dragon, was angry, was destructive. Beowulf spoke, boasted for the last time: \"I risked my life often when I was young. Now I am old.\" Time had not taught the son of Ecgtheow. Beowulf fought and fate denied him glory in battle. The glittering sword, infallible before that day, failed him. Wiglaf, son of Weohstan, went to his aid. The king dealt the dragon a deadly blow, but poison suppurated inside him, killed him. In his final breath, he gave to Wiglaf, the last of the Waegmundings, his helmet. With no heir, the son of Ecgtheow, by the son of Weohstan, was cremated, as ordered. And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, helps Hrothgar, son of Halfdene, against Grendel, a God-cursed brute. Beowulf gets old, gets killed.

Put very simply, English domination of the British Isles began in early medieval times, when the Norman and later the Plantagenet dynasties claimed suzerainty over Scotland, Wales and Ireland. That claim was given substance by the conquest of Wales, the slower subjugation of the Irish, and centuries of warfare against Scotland, ending with the dynastic union of 1603. Wales was fully incorporated into the English realm in the early 16th century, in the reign of Henry VIII. The last effective remnants of Irish native resistance to English rule were crushed by the end of that century, though Ireland retained its own nominally independent parliament. The united kingdom of Scotland and England became a full Union with the dissolution of the Edinburgh parliament in 1707. In 1800 the Irish parliament voted itself into oblivion, and Westminster lorded it over the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 the long process of political integration went into reverse, with the partial separation of Ireland, carved into two parts. The 26 counties of the south started with devolution, which developed into complete independence and republican status. The six counties of the north had the same initial standing as the south: a separate parliament and government under the crown, but remained part of the Union. That continued until 1972 when the system collapsed under the pressure of nationalist boycott and republican violence. Direct rule was imposed by the Heath government, which appointed Willie Whitelaw as the first secretary of state. Whitelaw and his successors, both Tory and Labour, upheld the local laws accreted under the old Stormont administration, but were accountable only to Westminster. There was an ill-starred attempt to reintroduce devolved, power-sharing government in 1973/74, but it evaporated in the face of diehard unionist resistance. The Good Friday agreement is designed to restore self government to Northern Ireland, with the additional ingredient of new institutional links between Belfast, Dublin, and Westminster. It coincides, but has little in common, with the separate devolution processes in Scotland and Wales. Now, just two months after Westminster relinquished its local powers to the new power-sharing government headed by Unionist leader David Trimble, it is preparing to take them back again. The re-imposition of direct rule means that secretary of state Peter Mandelson and his junior ministers will resume charge of the day-to-day administration of the province, in addition to their overall responsibility for security matters. Unlike in 1972, when the 50-year-old Stormont regime was swept away for good, the government now hopes to retain the Trimble administration, albeit in suspended animation, until it can resolve the dispute over paramilitary disarmament. If that day dawns, Northern Ireland will once again control its own affairs, and the 900-year-old political evolution of the islands will continue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/05/monarchy.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-05T01:53:56Z","webTitle":"It's almost like living in a republic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/05/monarchy.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/05/monarchy.comment","fields":{"headline":"It's almost like living in a republic","bodyText":"In an interview before her wedding, Sophie Rhys-Jones promised that she would not attempt to become the new Diana. Her word has been kept for her by the press. This week she became the new Fergie: mugged by pundits for wearing an animal-fur hat while leaving a private plane to walk towards a Rolls-Royce waiting to take her to a freebie residence. The Daily Mail - which had led this criticism - yesterday devoted its front page to more or less accusing the Earl of Wessex of causing a building firm to go into receivership by haggling over a Â£600,000 bill for work at his country home. The same day's papers revealed that princesses Eugenie and Beatrice are to be sent to school in Switzerland, where their mother may join them. Even 10 years ago, this decision would have brought appalled editorials. Now there seems to be a general sense that Switzerland's gain is ours too. These reports all tell the same underlying story: that, whatever the constitutional facts, we are living in a republic of the mind. Sending the offspring to chalet school is what exiled and deposed monarchies do. The sniping at the Wessexes is doubly intriguing in that it comes from the Daily Mail and that it concentrates on the money and privilege of the Windsors and their clan. The Mail has been the most monarchist of British publications. Yet the recent coverage of the couple would have fitted a republican publication. And the specific charge against them - that they are arrogant and privileged and fail to live like ordinary people - is a fascinating back-flip. What, after all, would be the point of monarchy, except to have more money, less humility and a more rarefied existence than other people? What's interesting about this week's pieces is that they had the effect of reading about a film star who you'd thought for some time was dead. In a way which seems astonishing even in comparison with 20 years ago, it is possible to go about your business for weeks or even months now in Britain without noticing there's a throne or a family on it. The only articles which bring them into the papers are carping ones. The Queen's golden jubilee in the year 2002 may be used to try to increase their visibility, but the royals could find themselves celebrating age and continuity in a culture increasingly devoted to youth and change. There have been four factors in this eclipse. The first is that Tony Blair has co-opted many of the ceremonial roles once entrusted to the throne and particularly in the areas of openings, mournings and symbolic utterances. His unusual youth has even allowed him to be the first prime minister to challenge the royals in breeding babies for the media and nation to adore. The loss of Diana - the show's one star - has also been significant, though not in the way predicted. It seemed briefly that the celebration of her might provide a platform for hostility to the monarchy. In fact, the reaction has been more like apathy. Finding the stage looking bare, many of the audience have simply torn up their tickets and left. Devolution has also played a part, as its architects in Scotland and Wales always knew it would but Tony Blair felt obliged to deny. A shrinking kingdom diminishes the monarch. It could logically have no other effect. And finally there is the problem - which Diana's death exacerbates - of the age and relative dullness of the central characters. The great and governing agony of the Prince of Wales's life is at a lesser level the difficulty for all monarchists. They are almost certainly in a long period - which may last for up to another 20 years - of waiting for something to happen. This is a problem which afflicts all systems which depend on posthumous succession in an age of sophisticated medical care. None of this means that an actual republic is close. At a time when political skill is defined as caution, the question is not going to be asked. Even if it were, there are at least two living British generations who grew up with enough flag-waving and commemorative crockery to vote a loud No in any poll. Indeed, the moment in the mid-90s - with the divorces and the concession on tax and the refusal to use public funds to rebuild Windsor Castle - when there seemed to be a momentum towards republicanism has now passed. There are no front pages now as terrifying as that time, and will not be until one of the young princes is caught doing something anti-social or illegal. The point is that Britain feels less and less like a monarchy. Such shifts are subjective and hard to define but, just as Scotland did seem to have a new atmosphere in the weeks after the opening of its new parliament, so England feels subtly different: in its newspapers and television stations and the conversations in its streets. The feeling is similar to the spell in an American presidency when he can no longer run for re-election but his successor is being lengthily selected. A lame-duck presidency, they say. The American electorate suffers that inconvenience for at most two years. British voters may put up with this one for a hundred or so, but the atmosphere of valedictory ceremonial is now the same: a lame-duck monarchy.

Another clue: if you own a house in this place, it's worth nearly twice the national average for homes in Britain. The answer, if you haven't already guessed, is London. If it were a country, the capital would rank above Sweden in terms of economic power; within a couple of years it will have overtaken Switzerland. London has always differed from the rest of Britain - but political, economic and social trends are conspiring to drive the wedge deeper. Londoners and other Britons look at each other with growing suspicion across the concrete border between the two worlds, the M25. A beer commercial starring two pointy-headed aliens drinking through their snouts featured a rural barman asking politely: 'Up from London, are we?' New Labour's strongly metropolitan tilt, with deals cooked up in trendy Islington restaurants, adds to a sense that the Government rules for the Big Smoke - prompting a swift rural tour by the PM, insufficient to prevent Agriculture Minister Nick Brown's messy encounter with a chocolate eclair hurled by a green activist. One of William Hague's few political successes has been to make capital out of the grievances of rural, middle-class England including the crisis in farming, the threat to ban fox hunting, and the intrusion of new homes on to the green belt. The 'Townie Tony' tag has stuck. Labour is resigned to the prospect of losing hundreds of council seats to the Tories in May, particularly in the 89 rural councils where voting will be taking place. The seats now up for grabs were last contested in 1996, when Labour was enjoying the incredible run of electoral success which preceded the general election. In that year, Labour won nearly 1,700 seats, and the Tories fewer than 500, so they now have more than three times as many to lose. But the latest spat goes beyond the usual rural versus urban jostling, and the tired 'north-south' divide. Phil Redmond, creator of Brookside, says it is 'a battle between the London clique and the rest of us'. The bifurcation of Britain is under way. Tony Travers, from the London School of Economics - not, notice, the British School of Economics - says that the process of devolution and the election of a London mayor and assembly is adding fuel to the fire. 'Having a mayor and assembly will help to create an even stronger sense of civic culture in London,' he says. 'There is no question that the process of devolution and directly-elected mayors will further fragment our political culture.' Political reform is formalising differences, giving a voice to long-buried sentiments and creating a breed of politicians who are obliged to echo local, partisan sentiments. Last week's embarrassing resignation by junior Defence Minister Peter Kilfoyle had nothing to do with complaints from the countryside. He was motivated by the relentless economic decline of his native Liverpool and a desire to see a Liverpool mayor with real power - a job that no one would be shocked to see him go for. And in the next few days the Welsh First Secretary Alun Michael is set to be the fall guy for a growing feeling in Wales that the valleys have been forgotten by a Labour Government obsessed with pursuing the votes of Middle England. Welsh-speaking Michael has never managed to cast off the image of being 'London's man'. The genie is out of the bottle. One of the greatest ironies of the constitutional reform process is that the attempt to disperse power has created platforms from which different parts of the country can blast away at each other. The prejudices have always been there, of course. A.N. Wilson thinks of 'London as a City State with a number of boring and rather expensive appendages (known as England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland) to which we have to be polite and which we are obliged, rather unwillingly, to subsidise, to ease the chips on their provincial shoulders'. But the prejudices are becoming politics: Trevor Phillips, when he was a candidate to become London's first directly-elected mayor, kick-started a debate about the level of subsidisation between London and the rest of the country, demanding that Scotland 'give back' Â£1-2 billion a year. The wars of distribution are likely to intensify once London has a mayor in place - and as the economic divide deepens. Economic output is Â£13,000 per head in London, compared to a national average of Â£11,000. The gap between GDP per head in London and the rest of the country has increased sixfold in the past 15 years. The pay gap, already 30 per cent, is set to widen to 35 per cent by 2003 according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. House prices continue to soar in the capital. And with London's service-based, international economy booming, the level of subsidy from London to poorer regions is more than Â£20 billion a year - or Â£8,000 for every metropolitan household. So while Britain complains about the political dominance of the capital, the capital moans about being used, in the London Evening Standard's phrase, as a 'giant cash machine'. But the real differences between the two nations, London and Britain, are not measured by Gross Domestic Product or fiscal transfers. The differences are visible to anyone who walks around Soho, Brixton or Brent. Travers says the ethnic diversity of the capital is the most important difference from the rest of Blighty. Half of the UK's black and Asian citizens live in London. 'Look at it this way,' he says. 'There are more black and Asian people in Brent, in just one of London's 33 boroughs, than in the whole of Scotland.' London absorbs between half to two-thirds of immigrants to the UK every year - refugees from Kosovo, nurses from South Africa, bartenders from Australia, bankers from America. It is now the world's melting pot. 'London is becoming a Manhattan-upon-Thames,' says Travers. 'Sustained economic growth, a flexible labour market and a reputation for tolerance are all making London a magnet.' Young Europeans are flooding in to be 'baristas' in the mushrooming coffee bars in the capital. A London bus typically echoes to the sounds of three of four languages. And even when immigrants are 'dispersed' - think of the Vietnamese population - follow-up studies show a drift back to the capital. Travers says that the revival of urban 'chic' is part of the attraction, too. 'Fifteen years ago the talk was all of people retreating to the countryside, and working down the phone lines. Now the population of London is rising, and the loft apartment culture is on the rise. Reinforced by the media, of course - which is strongly focused on urban issues. Series such as This Life , and US sitcoms, add to the glamour of city living. 'Programmes about the countryside tend to be about vets or rural detectives,' says Travers. 'All the exotic, high-powered, trend-setting images are urban ones, while rural images reinforce the image of thatched cottages, of an Agatha Christie Britain.' London's image has also been transformed by the lesbian and gay movement. Soho has gone from being a sink for drunks and prostitutes to a cafe society full of beautiful young things on the cruise. The debate over Section 28 was one of those moments when London looks at England in mystification, and vice versa. A couple of years ago the London Tourist Board advertised on the US West Coast using a picture of Big Ben and a strapline reading: 'If you think South Beach is the only place for tea, think again', a reference to gay 'tea dances'. The old clichÃ© that there are no gays in Scotland has some truth to it - most of them run to London to escape the homophobia north of the border. 'For people from outside, Old Compton Street (in Soho) or Brixton might be a bit a thrill,' says Travers. Come and see London: day-trips to tolerance. London is also young: four in 10 Londoners are aged between 20 and 44, against 36 per cent in the rest of the country; and central London has the highest proportion of all. London is liberal: 37 per cent of capital-dwellers believe that people should not be prosecuted for possessing small amounts of heroin, compared with 21 per cent in the country as a whole. Of course the London/non-London divide is far from clear-cut. Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow also brand themselves as trendy urban centres. Birmingham is ethnically mixed. And London is far from a uniformly wealthy, hip place: 94 per cent of the poorest council estates in England are in London; 75,000 families live in overcrowded conditions. And London supports - and welcomes - 50,000 destitute asylum seekers each year. But the debates about the place of London in Britain will only intensify. Pessimists point to France, where the metropolitan bias is still stronger, and the 'desertification' of the French countryside and rural economy. Maybe Westminster should up sticks itself, and meet as Travers suggests, in village halls around the country - revolve rather than devolve. 'What a difference that might make to policy!' he says. Two countries in one land? â¢ If London were a nation, it would rank above Sweden, Finland and Hungary in terms of economic output, with a Gross Domestic Product Â£2,500 higher per person that the UK as a whole â¢ Financial and business services account for 38 per cent of London's economic activity, compared to 25 per cent nationally.

Two years later, the Government has gone back to Disney, seeking not inspiration, but salvation. They have given the job of running the Dome to a Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, a 34-year-old French Disneyland executive and former one-time professional hockey player. Gerbeau, who likes to be called 'P.Y.', is almost totally unknown in Britain. Yet his new bosses boast he is a whizz-kidd, bubbling with ideas and enthusiasm, who helped save Disneyland, Paris, after its disastrous launch. They are hoping that having worked magic on the Magic Kingdom, he can now save the Dome from doom. The Government had good reason to look to Disneyland, Paris, for help. The similarities with the Dome are striking - and the lessons potentially invaluable. In 1991, Gerbeau left a job in management consultancy to join Euro Disney, as it was then called, a year before it was opened in a blizzard of hype. Like the Dome, Euro Disney failed to live up to its promise. The target was 11 million visitors, but after just one year, the number started dropping alarmingly, and fell to just 8.8 million. In 1993, the park lost Â£654 million, and speculation mounted that it would close. Gerbeau was part of the team of senior managers who saved it through a major relaunch. It needed to revamp its image, and top of the list was a name change. Like the Dome, the park was seen to lack focus, and not to capture visitors' imagination. A scary new ride, Space Mountain, was opened and succeeded in turning around morale. The park was widely criticised for being too expensive, so prices were slashed. Alcohol was introduced. There were too many 'hosts', and many were sacked. Within a year of its relaunch, the park was making an operational profit. Despite his young age, Gerbeau was rewarded for his enthusiasm and ideas with a succession of rapid promotions. In 1997, he was made vice-president of park operations. His experience will be invaluable in turning around the Dome. But it may not be enough. He will be able to cut prices, and staff, and even launch a new marketing drive. But with only months to play with, not years, his options are limited. He won't have time to introduce major new attractions. British children may be dismayed, but there will be no Space Mountain in Greenwich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/feb/06/seamusheaney","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-06T23:37:21Z","webTitle":"Audio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/06/seamusheaney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/feb/06/seamusheaney","fields":{"headline":"Audio","bodyText":"Beowulf Translated and read by Seamus Heaney Faber Penguin Audiobooks, Â£8.99 Running Time 2 hrs, 15 mins Buy it at BOL Long ago in Hrothgar's Danish kingdom lived a gruesome, demonic monster named Grendel who roamed the countryside inflicting terror on the citizens. Rising from his marshy home every evening, he would enter the king's hall and devour 15 warriors, taking another 15 home with him to gorge upon for a late-night snack. For 12 years the slaughter continued, until word of this heinous creature's deeds reached Beowulf, a great warrior from the land of the Geats. Beowulf killed the monster with his bare hands and then set upon its ghastly mother, freeing the Danish people from this reign of terror. Upon returning to his own kingdom, Beowulf ruled for 50 years until he was slain by a dragon, while remaining victorious in his bravery.

This award-winning poet, who last month won the Whitbread Prize for this work, has skilfully reinterpreted this Nordic myth of greed and victory, conveying parallels with the terrorism that exists in today's society.

After Kilfoyle, there is the choice of a Labour candidate for the London mayoral race. In between - tomorrow sees a critical vote in the Welsh assembly - the party may be forced to make another choice: either it keeps its anal-retentive style of control, ideological silence and intolerance of dissent or it embraces a pluralism that positively welcomes Scottish and Welsh deviation, variety in town halls and renewal of debate inside the party about its values and direction in a new century. The Welsh assembly has to answer a solid fiscal question - whether the spending straitjacket into which it was born can be altered so the United Kingdom can offer matching funds that will capture grants from the European Union for Wales. The need is unarguable. Outside the glitz of downtown Cardiff and the Samsung plants, much of south Wales is stubbornly undeveloping. But the censure motion which Labour faces (Plaid Cymru will win if the Liberal Democrats and Tories join it) is also about political style. Alun Michael, like Donald Dewar in Edinburgh, has been painfully slow to see how, in devolution, successful leaders must dance prettily: he must be seen enjoy the confidence of prime minister and chancellor while regularly putting symbolic distance between him and them. Slavish adherence to the line - Mr Michael too often gets compared to Stalin - is counterproductive. The Cardiff crisis was incipient in the results of the assembly elections, where Labour's poorish showing was partly caused by its short-sighted insistence on Mr Michael. Now Plaid, the wind in the west after its by-election victory, can render the assembly ineffective. That would be a disaster. As an experiment in practical democracy, Cardiff has been more than worthwhile. In the number of women in frontline positions, in its daily workings as a mini-legislature, it puts Westminster to shame. The next move must come from Downing Street. Gordon Brown is nothing if not a foxy chancellor: no \"additionality\" rule or territorial spending formula need get in the way of finding a way to spring the money from Brussels. For his part, Tony Blair has to countenance Alun Michael's replacement as Labour leader.

It is slightly frightening to work out just how little supports most of our livelihoods. In the past, people made their living by extracting ore, mining coal, making steel, manufacturing cars, bringing cattle to market. They mined, they made, they forged. Work was hard physical labour. As Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, put it in In Praise of Idleness: \"Work is moving things around at or near to the earth's surface.\" The output of this labour could be weighed on scales, shipped in railway cars, measured with rules, stockpiled. These days most people in most advanced economies produce nothing that can be weighed: communications, software, advertising, financial services. They trade, write, design, talk, spin and create; rarely do they make anything. The assets they work with are as ephemeral as their output. Of course many of us work in large buildings, offices and factories and we work with machinery and equipment, computers and robots. Yet the real assets of the modern economy come out of our heads not out of the ground: ideas, knowledge, skills, talent and creativity. Indeed, the richer and more powerful the person, the more likely it is that they make their money by manipulating ephemera and intangibles rather than from labour in any recognisable sense. There is no better example of this than one of the most successful thin-air businesses ever created, the British Royal Family, and one of the world's leading practitioners of thin-air economics, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The British Royal Family has no output other than symbolism, a vague sense of well-being it occasionally induces in its citizenry and a lot of gossip. Of course, the Royal Family is very rich. It owns a lot of prime real estate. But that is not the source of its power or standing. People do not come to see Buckingham Palace because it is a beautiful or striking building. They come because the Queen lives there. The Royal Family's value is as a national symbol: it's a brand. Its power and influence stem entirely from the ephemeral world of gestures and symbols. Its most precious assets are not physical but intangible: public popularity, loyalty, affection and the dwindling stock of human capital that are its members. Princess Diana proved particularly adept at thriving in this thin-air business. While the Royal Family remained rooted in the past, imprisoned by the assets and protocol which were once its strength, Princess Diana exploited one of the first laws of thin-air economics: those with the best image and ideas are more agile, quicker to adapt and better able to communicate directly with people than those weighed down by tradition, trapped by protocol or encumbered by physical assets which have outlived their usefulness. The Royal Family was trapped by its past, like a lazy, complacent incumbent in an industry it had long dominated: the very lucrative monarchy franchise for the United Kingdom. Diana was the upstart challenger, an entrepreneur who used new technology to outmanoeuvre the established but tired incumbent. For the Royal Family, read IBM; for Diana, read Microsoft and the new challengers in the computer industry which have emerged in the last decade. For the Royal Family read Barclays and NatWest; for Diana, read First Direct and the telephone and electronic banks which are the new competitors. Diana's celebrity was a product of modern economics. She was a celebrity on a global scale because we live in an era of global media, which allows a kind of global gossip. Celebrities have risen in tandem with the communications technology that makes them possible: it started with telegraph and wireless, now it is satellites and the Internet. When Charles and Diana got married in 1981 there were 11.7 television sets per 100 people in the world; now there are 23 per 100 people and broadcasting has been transformed by a digital revolution which is spawning hundreds of channels. It took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million users in the US. It took 16 years before the same number of Americans used personal computers. The Internet reached 50 million Americans within four years of being available to ordinary consumers. Global communications allow instant distribution of news and images at little cost to tens of millions of people. Pictures travel better than words. Words have to be translated; Diana's face was universal. Lennon and Churchill came up with memorable phrases; Diana came up with memorable looks. Gestures and symbols are the currency of global communications. Diana became a celebrity in the era in which Coke, McDonald's, Nike and Calvin Klein all became truly global brands, with symbols that could be recognized instantly from rural Turkey to Tokyo. So did Diana's smile. Images cross geographic and social borders far more easily than words. Diana was a largely silent star in a cacophonous age. Her life was meant to be seen, not heard. When she opened her mouth she destroyed her classless appeal and we remembered that she was just another Sloane. Princess Diana was a creature of the modern communications revolution. The current Royal Family, like so many of our other outmoded institutions, is rooted to its Victorian origins. But visual images alone do not sell; brands need personality. We seem increasingly attached to celebrities, through whom we live vicariously. Although Diana was rich, jetted about for endless holidays and lived behind high railings, she managed to conjure a reputation for being popular and accessible. She broke through protocol and convention to talk in public about bulimia and adultery. Celebrities of old were meant to be flawless heroes who were held up as moral exemplars: intrepid explorers, ingenious discoverers, inspired performers, visionary leaders. Diana, on the contrary, was compelling because she was flawed and seemed to acknowledge it. We knew more about Diana than most of us know about our neighbours. Diana was an intimate celebrity. Intimate celebrities - the famous people that ordinary punters feel close to and can trust - are among the most valuable commodities in the modern economy. They sell global products. Consumer-goods companies increasingly use celebrities to promote their brands: they want that mixture of excellence, ubiquity and intimacy that celebrities offer. Nike is the prime example of a company which built its brand around its association with idolised sporting celebrities: Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. There is a good economic reason for this. It's a response to competition. As markets become more crowded and competitive, it becomes ever more important for products to stand out by being distinctive. One way to achieve that is to associate the product with a celebrity the consumers admire, by investing his or her character in the product. Consumer-goods manufacturers have a vested interest in celebrities who can front their products to help them stand out from the crowd. It should be no surprise that after Diana's death the biggest controversies were about her after-life as a brand, in particular who should control the rights to use her name and image to promote products and make money. Our emotional response to Diana's death was fleeting. The anniversary of her death drew a muted response. Her commercial value will be more enduring. Fame is the basis for some of our most important industries: entertainment, music and sport. As Diana's career in the Royal Family was unfolding, so was this structural shift in the character of the British economy. Britain earns more from exports of rock music than it does from steel. She started her royal career as a blast from the past: a gawky adolescent, seemingly bred for a life of duty, wellies, gun dogs, children and forbearance. She metamorphosed into the embodiment of global chic, style and independence. She went from old Britain of landed aristocratic wealth to a new Britain in which wealth comes from the media, fashion, styling, branding. Diana was just one product of this celebrity economy. Diana's reach exemplified another aspect of modern economics: the power of directness. Diana went direct to the people by using the media. She bypassed formal channels. The Royal Family found that the protocol designed to entrench its power left it marooned, out of touch, unable to learn about the world around it. Diana, by contrast, seemed spontaneous, youthful, unstuffy. As Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, put it in his funeral oration, she was very British yet she had a global following (a combination British Airways still yearns for). The Royal Family was a national industry, trapped by its dependence upon a safe local market. The Windsors were cut off, locked in the past, introverted, trapped by their own past success: not a bad description of many established companies, for example the high-street clearing banks. In financial services, as much as the royalty business, the rewards will go to those who go direct to the consumer.

As a nocturnal Celt I am not at my best before 10am. So when I answered the insistent knock, I had to count the legs and divide by two in order to register the reality of Freedom of Expression in Blair's Britain. A team of six detectives from the ministry of defence clustered together on the path before my tiny Herefordshire cottage. In the gloom they might have been a collective, pantomime dragon. Undeterred by the fact that I am a civilian and that their jurisdiction covers Defence property and people, they arrested me and searched the house (including the soiled linen) for almost eight hours. When they left, my computer, files and floppies went with them, never to return. I was ushered into their unmarked car and we went in search of the local nick. I, their prisoner, had to direct them there so that they could begin a five-hour session of interrogation and imprisonment. The cause of all this fuss is still, in some significant details, unclear but I gathered that it all had to do with my most recent book, The Irish War, an account of The Troubles. They have got me into trouble more than once. During the illegal military curfew imposed upon the Falls Road, Belfast, in 1970, I was arrested at gunpoint (theirs, not mine) and accused of behaviour likely to break the peace. As it happened, I was the only person in sight who was not armed and dangerous . . . but that is another story. This time, to judge from the questions put to me, the trouble was that I had mentioned the generic names of some software programmes and had somehow breached section 5 of the official secrets act 1989. There was one small problem with this scenario. Nothing I had written had damaged military security (as the law sensibly requires for a crime of this sort to be proved). Nor had I put lives at risk. Even more curious, those pursuing me already had a shrewd idea that they were barking up the wrong tree. My own inquiries since have confirmed that the MoD knew that I had caused embarrassment to one or two sensitive souls but no damage to military operations. Thirteen months later, a newly appointed attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, intervened to halt the prosecution of me. I had lost most of a year's work - a serious matter for a professional, self-employed writer - and much else. The MoD felt confident enough to write to my publisher, HarperCollins, strongly advising the firm not to publish the paperback version of a book that remained on sale as a hardback, untouched by official action. HarperCollins, colluding with this act of censorship, obligingly suppressed the book. My work as military consultant to a television drama team was blighted by the MoD's warning that I was, effectively, blacklisted from setting foot on military property. The drama, entitled Bomber and screened as a two-parter earlier this month, was shot at an army camp. The knife was twisted further by a claim that the \"damage\" I had caused was financial - around Â£170,000, the alleged cost of changing software names - and that I should be forced to make it good. And then, coincidentally, came a series of poison-pen letters and telephone calls to my allies around the country, made by an anonymous \"friend of Tony Geraghty\", and calculated to blacken my reputation. What might have started as a legal process now looked more like a private vendetta. To begin to comprehend this bizarre series of events, it is necessary to look at what television drama calls \"the back story\". Over the years, as an experienced military writer, I have learned to trust my sources and discuss with them, on equal terms, the way I am shaping their experiences. It is a sophisticated version of the journalistic lobby system. I have learned not to trust the officially appointed channels for such transactions. The MoD has more than one. Civilian writers are expected to volunteer their unpublished work for \"clearance\" by the secretary of the defence, press and broadcasting advisory committee. This body includes token journalists to give it a patina of democratic cover. In practice, manuscripts submitted to it by gullible, if patriotic, authors are leaked to a variety of departments, ranging from MI5 to the SAS. These in turn run a textual analysis on the material and begin a mole hunt for the author's sources. How do I know that such leaks occur? Because I was the intended beneficiary of one: a proof copy of the uncensored version of Mark Urban's book about Ireland, Big Boys' Rules. The other, more powerful censorship team is run from the secretariat, home and special forces of MoD. It is this department which feels sufficiently confident to instruct publishers what they will and will not publish, without troubling with such trifles as injunctions or other legal processes. Through the back stairs of the ministry, the avuncular secretary of the D-notice committee, as my inquiries have discovered, works in practice for the secretariat, a body which does not include journalists among its ranks. In August 1998, two months before The Irish War was due to appear, the secretary - a retired rear-admiral - contacted HarperCollins, seeking sight of part of the book devoted to the activities of the SAS. I refused access. Not only did I distrust the system: I had tried, at the outset of my research, to involve the army at a senior level, on lobby terms, in my attempt to reconstruct the essential truths of Britain's last colonial war. This time, following an unannounced restriction on co-operation of that sort, I was left to go my own way. That was no problem. But I assuredly resented the implication that when the work was done, I would accept the hidden hand of the censor to edit the manuscript. I said as much to HarperCollins. The admiral was not a happy sailor. He took advice and decided to let the matter go rather than seek an injunction and accept the odium of public censorship. Had he followed that legal route, it would have blown the hypocritical cover that the D-notice system is voluntary. Still, he wrote to say that once the book was published he would look at it again and notify HarperCollins of anything he thought necessary. The book appeared. He took no action. But his controller in secretariat, home and special forces, did move. The result was the raid on my home; two interrogation sessions, an appearance in the dock at Bow Street and prosecution for an offence which, on conviction, could have put me in prison for two years. At the end of it all, the crown prosecution service concluded that there was insufficient evidence against me. Or, to put it another way, the prosecution did not have a viable case. The MoD will not have entirely wasted its time. The next time an author is invited to \"volunteer\" his work for censorship, he will think twice before refusing. Refusal, as my case demonstrates, may be followed by a year's harassment, threat of financial ruin and imprisonment. That is how it is in the Kingdom of the Blair, where the one-eyed man, if he is wise, will pretend to be as blind as the rest. There is no unalloyed pleasure in this life, even in Whitehall. The negative outcome of the aborted action against me will tempt some bold writers to use classified documents without inhibition in future, so long as they avoid damage. The signs are that this is beginning to happen. Within days of my release from official harassment, BBC Radio 4 uniquely announced that it was quoting from \"classified\" military material to reveal shortcomings in the British invasion of Kosovo. Clearly, knowledge of such failures would help the next potential enemy. But no one seemed anxious to raid the BBC or arrest its excellent correspondent, Andrew Gilligan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2000/feb/08/schools.simonhattenstone","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-08T01:09:57Z","webTitle":"Why no one wants to talk about it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/feb/08/schools.simonhattenstone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/feb/08/schools.simonhattenstone","fields":{"headline":"Why no one wants to talk about it","bodyText":"Schools are turning us down by the minute. One council press officer contacts every likely comprehensive in the borough. She phones back a couple of hours later. \"Sorry, no luck. It's just too sensitive an issue.\" A headteacher says he'd love to see his school in the newspaper, \"but this subject is too dangerous... every which way we lose.\" Another whispers that the Daily Mail is on the rampage, as if she expects the phone to be bugged. If anybody wants evidence of the damage caused by section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, this paranoia is it. All we have asked is whether the Guardian could come in to discuss sex education with a group of pupils. One by one, the headteachers tell us that, off the record, they consider sex education terribly important, but if they are seen to encourage an overly liberal or broad approach to the subject, they could create havoc. They can see the headlines already, a return to the reactionary hyperbole of yesteryear - loony lefty school promotes poofters; sack the pornography pushers. It's surprising that Tony Blair didn't foresee a problem in scrapping section 28 - introduced by Margaret Thatcher in 1988 to stop local authorities \"promoting homosexuality\" as a way of life, and misinterpreted by many people as meaning that telling children homosexuality was an alternative to heterosexuality was now out of bounds. He seems to have been unaware that homophobia is the last legitimate prejudice. Hence the fierce and diverse opposition from the likes of Cardinal Thomas Winning, who called homosexuality a \"perversion\" and likened the gay lobby's campaign to bombardment by Nazi war planes; Brian Souter, the owner of Stagecoach, who has donated Â£500,000 to the save section 28 campaign; and Peter Kilfoyle, who is alleged to have cited the proposed scrapping of section 28 as a reason for leaving the front bench. For once, Blair seems to have misjudged the mood of Middle England. At last a school agrees to see us. Step forward the heroic Hodge Hill in Birmingham, a 1,300-strong, multicultural, inner-city comprehensive. Trevor Edinborough, the gently spoken headteacher, seems a little twitchy. He takes us into a cell-like room to explain the terms. By all means talk about sex education, he says, but please don't mention the section. \"We could upset a lot of parents.\" I can't help thinking of Fawlty Towers. I tell him I'm more interested in finding out what sex education actually involves these days, and how important pupils feel it is. He looks relieved. \"For us this is a central part of the curriculum and it will grow. It's very much at the heart of the work we do with young children.\" Sex education is optional in primary and junior schools and compulsory in secondaries. But it is a long way from being a structured part of the national curriculum. Schools have to do something, anything, and it is up to their board of governors to decide what exactly. Trevor Edinborough says he would like to see the government provide a proper framework for schools to build their courses round. John Bennett, the health education, citizenship and community education director for Birmingham local education authority, believes this will only happen once section 28 is scrapped. Bennett says that in some areas of sex education, progress has been made. \"When we did it at secondary school, it was straight biology. Now you do a lot of the basic biology in primary school.\" He tells me about a television series he made in which 5- to 7-year-olds were introduced to the correct names for body parts used in reproduction, the 7- to 9-year-olds watched a live birth, and the 9- to 11-year-olds were discussing the intricacies of relationships. He's right. It is a far cry from my school days in the mid-seventies. We were given a biology teacher who drew a couple of organs on the blackboard and then retired with post-traumatic stress. The hardest kid in the year fainted when we were shown a film of childbirth. We were 14 at the time. A few months later, he got a classmate pregnant. When the girls were away from school for a few days, we didn't ask questions. Jane Bonner is Hodge Hill's personal health and social education teacher. In the old days we would have called her a sex education teacher, but she patiently explains that her specialism involves rather more than sex. She introduces me to a group of 10 14- to 15-year-old pupils working together on a project based on the novel Junk, in which two 14-year-olds run away together, end up in a squat and are forced to confront drugs, violence, sex and the whole shebang. Although the group is mixed, they have segregated themselves into boys at one end of the table, girls at the other. One by one, they explain why sex education is important. Derek Evans says: \"It's about how to be in a relationship. The pressures of growing up - you know, like periods for girls and puberty and peer pressure.\" Susan Lenihan is typical of the girls - she talks in a quiet, considered way. \"It's about much more than sex. It prepares you for life, the problems with relationships, and what you can get out of them.\" The group are relaxed with the word \"relationship\". A word we would have dismissed as poofy at school in the seventies. Intermingled with \"relationship\" are \"contraceptive\", \"unwanted pregnancy\", \"responsibilities\". Noel Smithen is ladsy and funny with a touch of the Ali Gs. He talks a lot, makes his mates giggle, and veers between the sensible and ridiculous. \"There never used to be so many teenage pregnancies, because people didn't know much about it, because people weren't taught about it.\" The group tend to say \"it\" rather than \"sex\". \"No, that's not true,\" the rest of the group chorus. \"Just because we know about it, doesn't make us more likely to do it.\" But Noel is on a roll. \"After a lesson listening to sex this and sex that, and you go home and you're with your girlfriend you probably want to try it out don't you?\" The group erupts into laughter. Derek Evans seems a more representative voice. \"If you didn't have the knowledge, then you'd be out of school doing what you can, getting girls under 16 pregnant and you'd have the police involved, you'd never be able to grow up properly because you'd have a child, you'd never be able to go out and enjoy yourself. Some parents wouldn't accept it and they'd put you out on the street.\" The group nod at the devastating scenario. Afterwards, John Bennett tells me there are many important myths to dispel. He says it's certainly not true, as Noel suggests, that there are more teenage pregnancies these days, but the figures are not as encouraging as they could be. \"In the 1970s, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands had about the same rate of teenage pregnancies - around 70 per thousand. We've reduced our rate to about 53 per thousand, while the Dutch have reduced theirs to about eight or nine per thousand.\" How did they manage it? He talks about a multi-agency approach involving the Catholic and Dutch Reform churches, the government, the education authorities, and how sex education was made more explicit and access to services was improved. Most telling is the fact that while the average age of first intercourse continues to decline by a year a decade in Britain (currently between 16 and 17), the Netherlands has steadied itself round the 18 mark. I ask the pupils whether they would prefer to be taught as a single-sex group. All but one say yes. \"Some girls don't feel comfortable with boys around them, and boys can be immature,\" says Iyesha Williams. The teacher, Jane Bonner, interrupts to say they will be doing some single-sex work in the future where it will be easier to look at more controversial topics in depth. She talks about the areas they cover in the Child Development GCSE - abortion, IVF etc. \"In social education we don't have the time, or rather we don't make the time, to look at one subject in detail.\" Ashley Francis is one of the few boys taking the GCSE. \"In Child Development we learn about every aspect, whereas in Social Education some aspects are left out because of the feelings of other people.\" Ashley is a sensitive, clued-up boy. He says one of the good things about sex education is \"You don't just talk about your feelings about relationships, but how other people feel as well - what your girlfriend may be scared about as well as what you may be scared about.\" The group is open, mature and easy with each other. So open that David Bromley admits: \"I didn't know much about all this before we started.\" We move on to homosexuality, and the debate becomes more heated. None of the children feels they shouldn't be taught about homosexuality, but Noel sums up the feeling when he says: \"I don't think it should be discussed that much because it's a minority.\" They argue that attitudes have changed over the years - because of programmes like Jerry Springer, we are more tolerant of difference. A recent survey by the lesbian and gay pressure group Stonewall revealed that 64% of women thought section 28 should be repealed, while only 43% of men did. And it is when the school group discuss homosexuality that there is the most noticeable difference in gender attitudes. The girls are far more tolerant, though even most of them think homosexuality is \"unnatural\". Iyesha says: \"It's important to talk about gay sex to tell people about the dangers.\" None of the group appears to be aware that in Britain last year more people contracted Aids through straight sex than gay sex. The longer we talk about the gay issue, the more the prejudices emerge. The same prejudices we hear in the adult world, on telly, in the newspapers. Derek has strong views. He delivers them perfectly reasonably, without a hint of the ferocity that so often accompanies bigotry. \"I think it's sick, to be honest. Man and woman were brought together by God for man and woman, not just for two men or two women. There was something on the news about two gay men adopting a child, and then you get people at school saying 'who's your mum?', and the kid says 'it's Bill'.\" Everyone agrees that it is unfair for gay men to adopt, that the child would be ridiculed at school. It's hard to disagree with them - no one knows better about bullying at school than schoolkids. Trevor Edinborough didn't want us to talk about section 28, the political issue. But he knew as well as I did that if we were talking about sexuality, we would also end up talking about homosexuality, the human issue. Not promoting, not proselytsing, but talking. As most teachers do at some point most weeks. If anything, the pupils' conversation shows what a a sham the whole section 28 debate really is. Promote homosexuality? Pervert a bunch of schoolkids? Who are they kidding? The best any realistic teacher could hope is to damp down the prejudices of the majority. Meanwhile, there's no stopping Derek. \"I don't know how anybody could do it, actually. I don't know how anybody could be attracted to the same sex. I think they should all be shot or something.\" The girls tut. \"It's up to other people to do what they do,\" says Susan. I ask again whether they think we are more open about homosexuality these days. Yes, definitely, they answer. Does that mean it would be easier to admit you are gay in school than years ago? No, says Noel with surprising softness. \"You can discuss it now, but if you come out and say you're this or that, you might as well just leave the school.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/feb/09/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-09T02:00:14Z","webTitle":"The price of crying rape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/feb/09/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/feb/09/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"The price of crying rape","bodyText":"If we are burgled, we go to the police. If we are mugged, we go to the police. If we are threatened, we go to the police, and if we are de-frauded, crashed into, lost. But if we are raped - ah, then, no: we do not automatically go to the police. A great majority of rapes go unreported (as many as nine in 10). It is usually a hidden crime - behind closed doors, in bedrooms or cars or down dark alleys, with the victim as the only witness - and for many women it remains a secret violation: undetected, unpunished, unknown. It is obvious why. We've read the statistics, and know that only 10% of reported cases ever make it to court, and only 24% of those are successful. We've read enough of the discomfiting stories in newspapers, where women are required to disclose intimate details of their past sexual history, for there is still a crude equation in which past promiscuity equals permanent willingness; only the innocent, the unworldly, the virginal and demure are favoured as suitable \"rapees\" (the accused, on the other hand, do not have to reveal their sexual history). For many women it can feel that they, not their attackers, are on trial. We know by now that \"no\" sometimes doesn't mean no, and that in any case some women utter \"no\" after the event, in retrospective shame and revulsion. That stranger-rape is terrifying, but that the newly-named genre, date rape, can slide all the way down the spectrum of brutal crime, into the murky and obscure world of private relationships. We know that \"consent\" is a slippery word, endlessly interpreted, and that his consent can be her refusal. That while yesterday's feminism condemned rape as the ugliest crime of a misogynist world, today's post-feminist world condemns instead the culture of \"victimhood\", where women allow themselves to be helpless, frail and diminished. That sex is a dark and tangled affair full of violence and misunderstanding and double meanings, and that the court is a harsh, brightly-lit, monolithic space where the private becomes glaringly public, and traumas are brutally replayed. And we know that especially with date rape there is very often little or no proof - it is frequently his word against hers, his character against hers. In a recent survey in America, 3% of men said they forced a woman to have sex with them against their will, while 40% of women said they had been thus forced. It's as if we no longer even know what rape means, and a dizzying gulf opens up between the genders. Men think they are having sex and women think they are being violated. Men think they're asking for it and women think that they are saying no. Into this treacherous arena comes the strange story of Lynn Walker, the pharmacist who accused a colleague of raping her, and who on Monday was ordered to pay him a staggering Â£400,000 in damages. She now faces financial ruin. Her limited assets (mainly a Â£70,000 house) are frozen and she is only allowed Â£150 a week of her Boots salary to live on. She has been branded a liar, and because the judge ordered her anonymity to be lifted, her face - a pleasant, anxious, bruised-looking face - is plastered across every newspaper. In 1996, Walker had accused Martin Garfoot - a senior pharmacist who worked with her at a branch of Boots in North Shields - of behaving inappropriately towards her. Later, at a more formal meeting with managers, she said he had put his hand up her skirt and called her a \"frigid cow\". In January 1997, after he had been suspended while Boots investigated her claims, she upped the stakes once more, claiming that he had \"almost\" raped her. Boots decided the allegations were not proven, and moved Garfoot (46, married, with two teenage children) to another branch. But Walker kept on with the allegations, and so he sued for libel and slander. In court her accusations escalated: he embarked on a campaign of physical and sexual harassment, he forced his penis into her mouth, his fist up her vagina; he attempted anal sex, he raped her; he made threats which led her to fear for her life. It was not difficult to understand why the jury, made up of eight women and four men, decided that Walker's allegations were false. They heard how she had made no mention of any incident to either her doctor or the police. They also saw CCTV videos showing Walker standing next to Garfoot a week, and a fortnight after the alleged attack, smiling at him and apparently at ease. Would she have gone on staff bowling nights with him, called at his home, signed a get well card, accepted lifts from him, given him a present if her accusations were true? The jurors plainly thought not. But why did they feel the need to ignore the judge's recommendations and order damages that would financially wreck Walker? What on earth was going on, that a woman should make up such a ghastly story about her life, and that a jury made up mainly of women should be so punitive? In court, the jury were told that Lynn Walker was a church-going teetotaller, whose ex-husband had had affairs with other women and had on occasions hit her. She was under pressure at work, and she was depressed. The stereotypical picture that inevitably emerges from these few facts is of a lonely woman, sucked into the nightmarish fantasies that she so graphically recounted in court. We have become familiar with the figure of the victim-fantasist - like Binjamin Wilkomirski, who imagined himself a Holocaust survivor and wrote his fake-memoir Fragments in a rhapsody of imagined and heroic suffering. Or like the young and disturbed women who people Kate Roiphe's influential The Morning After, crying rape to get attention, struggling to get to the centre of their lives in a mutant version of feminism. So, some women, because they are vengeful, maybe, or full of lonely fantasies, lie about being raped. They tell tales; make themselves the star of their own drama; the hero-victim who finds meaning and identity in suffering. But most women turn in the opposite direction, and don't talk about being raped at all. For them the law is a blind alley. They know what all women know: that the intolerable grey area of rape doesn't easily fit into the black-and-white world of law, and that justice can be very rough indeed. How can the rights of the complainant and the defendant be balanced? Over the past decade, legislation has been passed that supposedly makes it easier for women to report rape. It is illegal for a husband to rape his wife (it used to be impossible: to be a wife was to be always-consenting). Police officers are trained to deal sensitively with women who claim to have been raped. Date rapists have been successfully prosecuted. Counsel can no longer automatically cross-examine the rape victim in detail about her past sexual history. And yet at the same time, the number of successful prosecutions has dramatically declined, and attitudes towards rape have become disconcertingly lenient and full of contradictions. There's a split among women themselves: some think that a distinction should be made between rape and \"non-consensual sex'\"(there was I, thinking that rape was non-consensual sex). Some think the law should be altered even more in women's favour and others argue that that is to treat women as feeble and child-like. Some think that all sex is a kind of rape. Post-feminists have become positively light-hearted about it. Fay Weldon announced that she had been raped once but it was no big deal, and she mainly felt rather sorry for the little man who pounced on her in the back of a cab. Germaine Greer was contemptuous about the emotional trauma of rape. Camille Paglia implies that most heterosexual sex is gloriously a kind of no-means-yes rape, a violent and delirious Lawrentian struggle between man and woman, and only priggish, unawakened women do not realise that sex is a war. Kate Roiphe accuses her debilitated colleagues on campus of seeing sexual harassment wherever they turn because they are fearful of their own sexuality. When Jill Craigie disclosed that, decades previously, she had been raped by Arthur Koestler, Frederic Raphael asked her what she had expected of him. When Michael Tyson arrived in Britain he was given a hero's welcome (and after all, goes the refrain, what did that girl think was going to happen when she went back with him to his room?). In these readings, there are rapes that are not rapes; crimes against women which are not really crimes at all. Women really shouldn't be making such a fuss. For many years the legal process in rape cases was itself a form of institutionalised misogyny. Heard the one about the judge who invented the mitigating concept of \"contributory negligence\" because the victim had been hitchhiking back from a party in a short skirt? Remember the judge in the notorious \"Vicarage rape case\" who gave shorter sentences for the rape than for the burglary, because he thought the victim hadn't seemed very traumatised in court when she gave evidence? Remember the rapist who conducted his own defence and interrogated his victim in pornographic detail about her experience for two days in the witness box? Remember the Japanese tourist who spent more than a week giving evidence because each member of the gang who raped her had a separate lawyer? Some of these evils have been dealt with and some haven't, and some can't because of the nature of the offence. Because the peculiar horror and messiness of rape trials is the violation of two kinds of intimacy: what people do with their bodies and, equally crucially, what is going on in their heads while they are doing it. And because sex - the good, the bad and the ugly kind - occur in a territory all its own. Maybe the best image of sexual desire is Shakespeare's portrayal of the young lovers in A Midsummer Night's Dream. They go - as we have gone, haven't we, at some time or another? - into a dark wood, where they go mad, take strange potions, lose their way and their reason, and in the morning, return to the city, bruised and confused by what they have given themselves up to. Rough Justice: has Lynn Walker been treated fairly? Julie Bindell, spokesperson for Justice for Women I think the judge needs shooting. This is a disgrace. This man has got half a million pounds, compared to women who get Â£7,000 max if they are raped. A knock to your reputation is not quite the same as a knock to your safety and sanity, which is the result of a sexual assault for many women. I'm not saying that people should be able to falsely accuse people, but the gesture of this judge and this jury is malicious. It will ruin this woman's life, as well as that of many women who come after her. Dylan Jones, editor, GQ magazine Although her motives have not been made explicitly clear, I do think that naming this woman sets an appalling precedent. As a women's group said today, it will deter women from coming forward. It's an isolated incident, but the ramifications will be severe, particularly because of many of the positive gains that have been made. GQ often has slightly arch features about the sex war, but this is not something that can be contextualised in this way. I think what's happened to her is appalling, and I can't imagine anyone thinking differently. Angela Phillips, author, The Trouble with Boys The whole point of the protection afforded to rape victims is to provide anonymity so that they might report something to the police. It's hard to see how that might apply in this case because she didn't report it to the police. If this is just a libel trial, why should she be given protection that nobody else would get in similar circumstances? If we think that, as a result of this, men will use libel law as a weapon against women accusing them, then that's very serious, but I think that's the only issue here. Adam Jukes, psychoanalyst, author and coordinator of the Men's Centre I can imagine that a great many men are gloating, feeling some sense of vindication. It's increasingly common to hear even very abusive men complain about the growing imbalance of power between them and women. There's a backlash claiming that women are just too powerful. I think what this judge did was profoundly misogynistic. What possible public interest can be served by naming this woman? If it's true that she lied, she clearly needs treatment not shaming. Isn't the money enough of a blow? I think it's appalling. How many women are awarded damages when they get raped? Sue Lees, professor of women's studies at the university of north London I don't necessarily think that the result of this libel case will lead to fewer women reporting rape to the police: this woman didn't report it. As for her anonymity in this case, it's not the same as someone being protected in a criminal trial. One of the reasons women are protected when they report rapes to the police is because we know that the level of intimidation is enormous. So her protection is partly so that she won't be intimidated into not giving evidence. It is obviously very different to reveal a woman's identity in a civil libel case, particularly after the case is over. Ian Kelly, operations director, the United Kingdom Men's Movement We are delighted. We believe that if a man is acquitted at a rape trial, and a woman is found to be lying, she should get the tariff that the man would have got had he been convicted. The man should also be able to sue for damages. We're in 100% support of the decision to name her. In our view the woman has been properly punished for lying in a court of law. I hope it is a warning to any woman who thinks she's going to pick on some poor guy who she might have had consensual sex with the night before."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-09T02:00:19Z","webTitle":"Bonnie Cashin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4","fields":{"headline":"Bonnie Cashin","bodyText":"Gene Tierney's wardrobe in the 1944 Hollywood film noir, Laura, is like no other of the period. She wore, not costumes for an actress's part, but real clothes that could have been owned by a real woman: separates, a witty raincoat and hat. They, more than the script or playing, suggest Laura chooses what she wears: not to advertise nubility or family wealth but to please herself. They were the work of Bonnie Cashin, who has died aged 85. She was born in Oakland, California, designed for the Roxy Theatre in New York at 21, and then created sportswear for Adler &amp; Adler from 1937 to 1943. She was already established when the US apparel market changed during the second world war: women with well-paying wartime jobs bought as many clothes as dearth of materials permitted, spending their income on quality casual wear. Cashin, like her contemporary Clare McCardell, got a big break. Her ideas had developed along very American lines: mass-production of ready- to-wear clothing in standardised sizes had been invented in the US to uniform the civil war, and was the basis of the 20th-century business in sports and hardwork wear. Many Americans wore it all day, every day; it did not have the low-class connotations of European peasant smocks or servants' uniforms. European tailoring and dressmaking were at their best when fitted individually, and were intended for display, not physical effort. But from the duster coats of prairie riders (later drivers) to shirtwaists, the female version of a male shirt, there was a tradition of sartorial freedom in America - schoolmarms, lady \"typewriters\" and telephonists had already shortened working skirts to their ankles by 1900. People wore democracy. When Cashin showed boots with tweed suits in her 1943 collection, she was looking to America's past and future simultaneously. She claimed to \"articulate with the body\" rather than encase it; she loosely fitted and wrapped garments; she layered light separates for warmth. She adopted and adapted anything which intrigued her: ponchos instead of coats; snaps, eyelets, toggles and industrial zippers as fasteners; canvas, jersey and, especially, leather as fabrics. Leather had been used as heavy-duty weatherproof wear in war, motoring and aviation: Cashin used light glove weights, dyed in colours bright as the Thai silks she loved and sewed as if they were fabric. She was as adventurous with design as materials, again inspired by industrial details - the hooded jacket, the \"pocketbook\" pocket with a snap closing, the jump suit (outrageous in silk-lined leather in the early 60s), the shoulderbag imitating army ammunition carriers, and the leather tote bag modelled after a paper shopping holdall - now a standard. She was also inspired by ethnic costume, less by its elaborate decoration than by its simple cut. Her film career at 20th Century Fox (including The Keys Of The Kingdom, 1944, in which she suggested the Chinese location with quilted robes) ended in 1949. The studios adored Dior's new look of 1947 because his excess of skirts, corsetted torsos and high heels were ideal for selling the bodies of movie stars. But Cashin was uncomfortable with the discomfort of that mode, sure that the American woman would never give up slacks, sweaters and unstructured coats. She returned to Adler, then opened her own house, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952, also creating outerwear for Philip Sills and gloves, bags and raincoats for specialised manufacturers. She sold through boutiques in London and Paris department stores, a commonplace idea now but not in the 50s and 60s. Cashin was famous in the world of Vogue but still a minority public taste in those decades, when democracy in fashion seemed to mean the right of women to dress as if they were a leisured class even when they were not, and to buy many, frequent changes of style. She founded a new knitwear company in 1971, again concentrating on techniques previously used for folk or workwear, but although the recipient of almost every design honour in the US and Britain, she retreated from the business just as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan turned her ideas into empires. She lived to see her vision vindicated, the world clad in Cashin concepts, fastened with the metal clasps and snaps she pioneered; the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum showed her work in 1997, describing it as \" for intrepid and independent women\". Among her charitable enterprises were revitalising the Indian handloom industry in the 50s, and funding the distinguished visitors' lectures at the Californian Institute of Technology to allow artists to talk to scientists. That she also thought was democracy.

Can't have been too many of those: Please, no national stereotypes. The International Court of Justice is still investigating our dodgy Pass Notes on Belgium. Why is he back in the news? Some argument over an atrocity? No, despite being a mercenary, Garibaldi's record is pretty well spotless. He fought for republican causes in the 1830s, battled with the forces of oppression in Brazil and Uruguay in the 1840s, and, backed by just a thousand of his legendary Redshirts, overthrew the Bourbon dynasty in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1860-61, thus uniting Italy under King Victor Emmanuel II.

That new year's resolution to take more exercise seemed like such a good idea. For a few weeks you managed to keep going, and you saw the turkey fat begin to melt from your waistline. Then your ankles swelled, your ligaments tore, your shoulder gave out, your tennis elbow returned, your knee popped or - as happened to me -your shins splintered. Well that's what it felt like. Walking upstairs became agony, walking down again was worse. I have developed a bandy gait in order to try and keep the weight off my calves. Too much well-intentioned tennis, football and jogging, and now someone seems to be sticking needles through my legs. Friends told me to go to a sports injury clinic or physiotherapist, but either option will surely cost more money than I want to spend (my body is a temple without an offering plate). Maybe an online check-up, for the price of a local phone call, would be a sensible first option? I started at Medisport. It couldn't be simpler: you click where it hurts. Each area of the site's body map leads you to description of symptoms and details the possible cause of injury. Then you get advice on managing and treating the problem. They recommend the RICE method - rest, ice, compression and elevation - for managing a low grade injury in its early stages (not that mine is low grade, of course). There are illustrated details of exercises, biological information about what's going on with your body, and advice for helping it heal: vitamin C, surprisingly, is one tonic. At www.fitnessfind.com there is a huge array of topics, easily accessible from the opening page: no map, but almost every part of the body seems to be covered, as well as different kinds of sport. It has also collated links to a vast array of articles and information available at other sources. Titbits include how to avoid overtraining, arthritis hazards, excessive sweating, and 101 ways to stay fit when you're injured. At Thrive online there is a searchable database of injuries and treatments, as well as direct access listings for the more common problems, like decompression illness and twisted testicle. It is, of course, the season for recovering from winter sports injuries. If the slopes have knocked you about, try www.zyworld.com/aviemed These are the web pages of a six-strong medical team based at the foot of the Cairngorms. As well as the obvious ski injury advice, it also has some interesting statistics on the newer dangers of snowboarding. Snowboarders, it seems are almost twice as likely to injure themselves as skiers, and twice as likely to fracture their bones. The typical profile of an injured boarder is (unsurprisingly) a young, inexperienced male. He will no doubt be gratified to learn that he boasts a pattern of typical injuries very different to those incurred by skiers. Some US ski sites offer something extra: tips on suing your fellow skiers when they have knocked you from your feet. James Chalat has a law practice in Colorado that specialise in skier on skier collision cases www.skisafety.com. One client won $2.4m from another fumbling skier. Be warned: skiing in the US might hurt your wallet even more than your body. Of course, you may have opted to start the year with a safe, impact-free sport, such as swimming, and then been shocked by the onset of \"swimmers ear\". Help is at hand at www.sinuscare.com, where you can learn how to combat the fungi and bacteria that can cause infections in the ear canal. There is advice on making your own eardrops with rubbing alcohol as the base. It also tells you about larger biological hazards: of the many types of insects that can get into the ears - gnats, moths, and cockroaches are apparently the most common. Gnats need special attention: they get tangled in the wax and cannot fly out. One thing I failed to find was a directory of UK sports injury clinics willing to take away my money and my pain. The National Sports Medicine Institute of the United Kingdom has a site, but with little useful information. It does at least give a telephone number, which would help those needing to find local care. My particular torment, it seems, is caused by shin splints. On the web I have found sound advice: rest (can do, no problem), and a series of exercises to help prevent a recurrence when I start training again. I plan to start the exercises as soon as I've per fected my resting technique. After all, I should heed the advice given at www.drugbase.co.za \"Common sense, and the self-discipline of knowing when to stop, or when not to start, a session of physical activity are two essential factors in avoiding any kind of injury.\" I'm sure they're right. I should find the self-discipline to be able to listen to what my body is saying.

In a special Commons statement, Mr Straw announced he was taking the extraordinary step of personally deciding on any applications, in a bid to head off right-wing criticism that Britain was seen as a \"soft touch\" on asylum seekers. \"Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as reasonably practicable,\" he told the Commons. \"As a matter of public policy, I believe that the clearest and unequivocal signals must be sent out so as to discourage hijacking, whatever its motive,\" Mr Straw said. \"While I must and will act in accordance with the law, I am determined that nobody should consider that there can be any benefit to be obtained by hijacking.\" Of those on the plane, 60 had so far told immigration officers they wished to apply for asylum along with 14 dependants. The remainder had yet to make their wishes known. Mr Straw pledged to \"respond resolutely to any attempts like this to use terrorist methods, whether the aim is to advance a political cause or to benefit the individuals concerned\". He explained that the hijacked plane had been allowed to land at Stansted in accordance with Britain's \"international obligations\". There had been \"serious concerns about the safety of those on board, given the threats that had been made earlier to kill passengers, uncertainty over fuel levels and reports of technical problems\". Mr Straw said no political demands were made at any time following the plane's arrival at Stansted, although statements were made to negotiators about the political situation in Afghanistan. No undertakings \"of any kind concerning asylum\" had been given by government representatives during the negotiations and \"the surrender from the plane was unconditional\". Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe told MPs a deterrent to future hijacks would be to ensure Britain's asylum procedures were not \"noticeably softer\" than those in surrounding countries. \"Why the United Kingdom?\" Miss Widdecombe asked. \"Why did it decide that it would land here and try to take advantage of our asylum procedures? Is it that those procedures are known to be rather more congenial than some which appertain in other countries which are nevertheless still signatories to the 1951 convention [on refugees] and to the ECHR (European court of human rights)?\" She welcomed the home secretary's decision to decide the asylum applications personally but stressed that speed was of the essence. Mr Straw agreed speed was important in processing asylum seekers' claims and said special arrangements had been put in place with that aim. Liberal Democrat spokesman Simon Hughes said rules should be set down if the home secretary was going to start \"calling in\" immigration and asylum applications on a regular basis, as he recently did with boxer Mike Tyson. \"Can we have rules that govern that just as one does for calling in planning applications, rather than you simply being able to pick and mix with nobody knowing whether they are going to get special fast treatment from you or the normal treatment from somebody else?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/feb/11/uk.politicalnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-11T13:02:15Z","webTitle":"Commons approves bill to lower gay age of consent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/feb/11/uk.politicalnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/feb/11/uk.politicalnews1","fields":{"headline":"Commons approves bill to lower gay age of consent","bodyText":"Britain's lower house of parliament approved a bill on Thursday reducing the age of consent for gay sex by two years to 16, throwing down a challenge to the upper house which rejected the legislation last year. Members of parliament in the House of Commons backed the reform by 263 to 102 in a free vote which allowed them to decide according to their own conscience rather than along party lines. It was the second time in just over a year that MPs had overwhelmingly backed the change. Last year their first attempt was frustrated when members of the upper chamber, the House of Lords, voted the bill down. Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government says the law must be changed to comply with European rights obligations, and threatened to railroad the legislation through parliament if the peers try to block it once again. Already this month the House of Lords, even keener to pick a fight with Blair since he removed more than 90 percent of its hereditary peers last year, has voted down a law which would repeal a ban on school teachers promoting homosexuality. \"The issue raised in this bill is one of equality, of seeking to create a society which is free from prejudice, where our relationships with others... are based upon respect not fear,\" said Home Secretary Jack Straw, introducing the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill. Opposition Conservative Party spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe, who opposed the bill, said it was fuelled by a mistaken sense of political correctness. \"I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young,\" Widdecombe, a matronly and proudly traditionalist figure on the Conservative benches, told parliament. She said the government's intention to lift the ban on school teachers promoting homosexuality meant lowering the age of consent for gay sex was even more misguided. \"A 16-year-old will not only be able to engage in homosexual acts, but local authorities will be able to spend public money to promote such acts,\" Widdecombe said. The bill would also bring in new measures to protect young people of both sexes under 18 from abuse of trust by teachers and care workers. The measures were included after a series of scandals involving paedophiles in schools and children's homes. Straw said the steps would protect young people in detention, in homes or under medical care, or in full time education. \"This bill is long overdue for the statute book... We need to move now to ensure equality and justice and better protection for our children and young people throughout the United Kingdom,\" Straw said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/feb/12/religion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-12T02:58:51Z","webTitle":"God's disunited kingdoms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/12/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/feb/12/religion","fields":{"headline":"God's disunited kingdoms","bodyText":"The Guardian has some readers who consider themselves religious and some who don't. Given this, there is a hint of cheerleading in the very notion of having a religious affairs editor - a post I am leaving after eight months. The job is a bit like being, say, not health correspondent, but homeopathy correspondent. Conventional medicine people assume you are rooting for the other team; users and practitioners of homeopathy assume you are, to some extent, on their side. It is a weakness of English that there isn't an everyday word like \"health\" or \"environment\" which embraces the things to which religion once laid exclusive claim, but which society now draws from wider sources: ethics, philosophy, the meaning of life. The Germans have a word for it, Weltanschauung, meaning a particular philosophy of life, but not even their newspapers have a Weltanschauung correspondent. Belief and organised religion are, of course, not the same thing. As the Jewish- by-descent, church of England-christened, Scottish Episcopal Sunday-school- going son of an Anglican mother and a nominally kirk father, who late in life converted to Catholicism, with one sister a Buddhist nun and the other a follower of Sri Chimnoy, I suppose I'm typical of the religiously uprooted mass who have forgotten what it is like to belong to a faith community. Writing about such latter-day martyrs as Lavinia Byrne, I have found my personal sympathy for a liberal voice mingled with doubt. Heretics don't run the risk of being burned at the stake any more, yet Catholic and Anglican rebels sometimes act as if they do, mimicking, for obscure reasons, the obsession with \"unity\" and arcane horror of schisms demonstrated by, for instance, the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Some decades ago, Rabbi Louis Jacobs, convinced that the Torah should not be taken as the literal word of God, scandalised British Orthodox Judaism by breaking away to set up his own network of synagogues. His Masorti movement is now doing very well. Dissident British Christians in the established churches are reluctant to take the same sort of step. The split between, say, Catholics and Protestants is seen as a wound which should be healed. There is an assumption that the fewer rival religions there are, the fewer religion-based conflicts. But might a myriad of tiny, subtly different faiths and denominations not be more peaceful than a handful of big, hard-edged ones? I've come across charming spokespeople for this or that hierarchical religious movement rolling their eyes at my account of someone they considered \"fringe\", \"exotic\" or \"extreme\". Yet these are the very people who, for me, embody the urgency, intensity and sacrifice of what I always imagined religious experience to be. I think of the recusant monks of the Transalpine Redemptorist order, living an ascetic life on the edge of Orkney; of the Rev Geraint ap Iorwerth, the nominally Anglican priest of Pennal, in Snowdonia, trying to revive the mystic spiritual side of Christianity by, among other things, building a stone circle in his back garden; of the surviving Quaker conscientious objectors, whose courage in living by their beliefs was rarely matched in this country last century. What these people have in common is something the leadership of the established British religions have largely lost: a disregard for what society as a whole thinks of them. Today's British religious heirarchs want too much to be liked. But the more frantic their efforts to make themselves heard by everyone, the less anyone will listen.

Gerbeau and his dome of doom","bodyText":"Six weeks into the new millennium, and the dome experience has been bleak for New Labour. Jennie Page, the chief executive, has been sacked, the scapegoat for the mistakes of two ministers, Peter Mandelson and Charles Falconer. The business world has been stunned. Many chief executives are holding their breath, hoping that the idea of firing someone for just one month's bad figures does not catch on. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the Guardian produces a far from flattering story about the qualifications of the new chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau. He's jetted in from Disneyland Paris in a desperate ministerial bid to save some bacon from this pig of a project. He has no wish to change any of the zones, but is considering cutting the entrance prices. That gives everyone who was thinking of going to the dome an excellent reason to put it off. Regenerating brownfields in a bend of the river near some of the world's most beautiful buildings at Greenwich was a good idea. The dome itself is an exciting space, full of potential. But you are not allowed to go by car. At Â£20 for each adult on top of the train and tube fares, it is a big outlay if you are coming from far away, and difficult to get to even if you are closer. If it is going to cost you more than Â£200 for a family of four and involve several hours travelling each way, it's got to be worth it. The dome was over-hyped. A government which has lived on burnished reflections of itself in polished, friendly newspaper stories was suddenly made to look unpopular and foolish. Some came to see the whole dome story as a political allegory. In advance of the opening there was a bravura performance of presentation and hype. The spirit zone was something of an afterthought and had to be filled up at the last minute. It seemed as if the organisers had to be reminded that the calendar we were celebrating was a Christian one. At the opening a whole series of politically correct messages were sent of New Britain. Christianity took second place to 60s pop and a new kind of monarchy held hands with the prime minister. It was neither socialist nor traditional. After the opening people felt let down, disappointed, not sure promises had been delivered, not sure they had enjoyed it all as much as they were told they had. The river of fire, one of the big events, was apparently invisible to those who turned out to watch it. Fortunately it had been captured by a lonely cameraman far away on the Post Office tower, so the fees could be paid. There were poignant contrasts between the way the cabinet had travelled to and from their party, and the way the rest of us were treated. Someone of ministerial rank now needs to get a grip and issue new instructions to M. Gerbeau, the Disney arrival, on what they want. If they want the dome to rival the strap-hanging, stomach-churning excitement of Alton Towers, Blackpool Leisure Beach or Thorpe Park, they need to put in an exciting ride or two. If they want it to rival the information and interest of the Science or Natural History museums, they need to rewrite the scripts and beef up the zones. If they want to use their man from the magic kingdom to good effect they should tell him to lift the standards of housekeeping and service to those of American Disney. At the moment the dome is not part of the have-a-nice-day culture: it's mired in we've-had-our-day attitudes. It needs to be cleaner, sharper, more fun. After a few minutes in Disney California or Florida even the most hard-bitten cynics can suspend their disbelief. You just want a bigger ice-cream from the Main Street store. You believe in Peter Pan as you go flying over London. The adrenaline flows as you hurtle in the runaway train. The dome doesn't suspend the disbelief of many an adult, and it can even bore many a child. It needs some magic, more things to do, more excitement. It would also help if they put in a few more eating places, for if visitor numbers do pick up half of them will starve in the resulting food queues. It's all too like New Labour at the moment. It lets down its natural supporters, and gives its traditional critics a field day. The new French chief executive has taken on more than the task of reviving a flagging leisure facility. He has also to help rescue the \"third way\", which has turned out to be all spin, no substance, heavily loss making and a bit of a yawn.

Personal history. Accra, the capital of Ghana, was where I spent most of the first 10 years of my life, and I was embarked on a journey of rediscovery with my father, Michael, who went out as a colonial administrator during the second world war and stayed for 17 years, till the Gold Coast gained independence in 1957. This was his first return in 40 years. Ghana's rapidly growing population has put an enormous strain on the country's fragile economy and an education system of which it is justly proud (UN secretary-general Kofi Annan went to school not far from Elmina). Accra, whose airport is the point of entry for most visitors, is the first surprise. So vast and sprawling - the city covers 10 times the area it did in 1960 and is almost unrecognisable. Every road seems permanently choked with traffic and the fumes of thousands of badly-tuned diesel engines. Every taxi ride, however short, takes at least 40 minutes and leaves your lungs feeling like those of a smoker with a terminal habit. What the pollution does to the hordes of young traders trying to sell bread or chewing gum through car windows scarcely bears thinking about. All in all, not an attractive place to spend more than a day or two, though the people here, as elsewhere in Ghana, are extraordinarily friendly and good-natured, and there is an endless amount of fun to be had reading the names of the shops and factories as you sit in traffic jams: Charisma Shopping Centre, French Kiss CafÃ© and God First Terrazzo Works. Religion touches almost everything in Ghana, a tribute either to the missionaries' zeal or Africans' easy acceptance of the Gospel. Accra has any number of monuments either created by or dedicated to the late Dr Kwame Nkrumah. Despite the army coup that forced Ghana's founding father into exile and death in neighbouring Guinea, President Jerry Rawlings has seen fit to build a mausoleum for him on the sea front. We choose not to visit it, preferring to admire the two bronze statues of Nkrumah in the gardens of the national museum, one missing its arms after he - and it - were toppled in 1966. The museum itself is full of fascinating artefacts, including fine examples of kente cloth, historical regalia, wooden carvings and a selection of royal stools with such gnomic inscriptions as \"He who follows the elephant encounters no dew\". Attached to the museum is a well-run self-service restaurant where, for less than Â£2.50, you can sample a wide range of Ghanaian cuisine. It's a useful introduction because, in many of the cheaper hotels and restaurants, the local grub is all that's worth eating. Most meals comprise one course with two main ingredients: a grapefruit-sized ball or two of fufu or banku , depending on whether it's made from pounded cassava, yam or fermented maize, and a fish or chicken stew to add flavour. Scoop a ball of the white starch in your hand, dip it into the peppery stew, and then pop it into your mouth. Easier said than done. Most food is cooked in the red oil of palm nuts, and all too often I was left looking like a clown whose make-up had slipped. Thank heavens for the bowl of water and washing-up liquid that came with the meal. Then I discovered red-red : fried plantains with black-eyed beans. It rapidly became a favourite, not least because even Africans eat it with a knife and fork. There are three principal routes out of Accra. To the north-west lies the Ashanti kingdom with its capital in Kumasi, to the west the Cape Coast region, with its string of old European castles and forts. But our trip down nostalgia lane takes us east along the coast through dry savannah country towards the Togo border. With our knuckle-popping young Ghanaian driver at the wheel of a 4WD Toyota Landcruiser, we head for Ada, on the mouth of the Volta river, where my father was a young district commissioner just after the war. Hotels in Ghana veer from a few expensive establishments along the coast, where everything is priced in US dollars, to mid-range and cheap hotels that have a faintly dilapidated air but where the Ghanaian cedi goes a long way. The Paradise Beach Hotel at Ada offers all the comforts of an upmarket hotel, with a large swimming pool, a great view across the Volta and an attractive setting for a get-away-from-it-all holiday in Africa. One note of caution: the incidence of bilharzia - a worm infection transmitted by snails in slow-moving water - has risen since the Volta dam was built and slowed the river flow downstream. The short drive from Ada to the river bridge at Sogakope takes us through the village of VumÃ«, where large, colourful pots line the roadside. The distinguished English potter Michael Cardew spent several years upgrading and running the local pottery during my father's stint as DC. We stop and are taken to meet the elderly village chief. Of course he remembers Cardew. \"He came during the Attlee administration,\" he recalls. From Sogakope, we take the dirt road north to Ho, whose large open-air market offers an array of local produce, including trays of tripe and giant snails for those with strong stomachs. From there, we head west to Akosombo and a night at the Volta Hotel. Situated about two hours' drive from Accra, this well-kept hotel offers an attractive weekend escape from the crowded capital. From here, it is possible to take day trips to a small island or longer, more adventurous voyages on the 250-mile-long Volta Lake. The long cross-country drive to Kumasi follows an escarpment before entering a region of tropical rainforest that I remember well from my childhood. But where are the trees? The answer becomes apparent as we crawl into Kumasi past large wood factories. Timber, along with cocoa, is one of Ghana's chief exports but, at the rate the forests are being felled, we fear there will be little left to log in 20 years' time. Kumasi is the true cultural heart of Ghana. Although the British made Accra their colonial capital, Kumasi has a king - the Asantehene - and a golden stool that symbolises a proud Ashanti empire that long predates European interest in West Africa. It took many years in the late 19th century for the British to subdue the spirited Ashanti, and it was only with the capture and exile of Prempeh I to Seychelles 100 years ago that British control over the Gold Coast was complete. Manhyia Palace, built to mark the Asantehene's return from exile in 1926, is open to the public, but no cameras are allowed inside and you must be accompanied by a guide. The two-storey palace is a veritable time capsule filled with the absurd gifts of visiting dignitaries. Cupboards drip with heavy gold ornaments that the king wears on Akan religious days, and alarmingly lifelike effigies of past kings and queen mothers greet you in several of the rooms. Our two nights at Kumasi are spent at the grand but gloomy City Hotel, built among the spacious bungalows in the old colonial quarter. The state-run hotel appears to have had no money spent on it since it was built in the early 1960s. No one remembers when it last had running hot water. But the staff are more than willing to bring up steaming buckets and cheerfully turn out at all hours to replace broken fittings. This is a cedi hotel, costing the equivalent of Â£13 a night for a double room. The road down to the coast to Elmina passes Kakum National Park. Although forest elephants and the fabled bongo are said to inhabit this corner of preserved rainforest, its main attraction is the spectacular rope walk in the forest canopy - one of only four of its kind in the world. A uniformed guide takes groups through the forest to the first of a series of walk ways suspended between huge tropical trees. It is probably as well that the ground is invisible 50ft below as we take it in turns to bounce along the narrow planks, desperately clutching at the cable handholds for reassurance. After a reasonably gruelling week on pot-holed roads, the attraction of the beach and a cool sea breeze are almost overwhelming. We spend a couple of nights at the Elmina Beach Resort, still in the process of construction, and our last night before catching the flight home at the top-of-the-range Labadi Beach Hotel, just outside Accra, where my family spent many happy Sundays by the beach. Ghana hasn't been yet spoilt by tourism, which is still in its infancy. Although conspicuous by our colour, we felt almost invisible in Accra. As visitors, we were everywhere greeted with a friendliness that would put most Brits to shame. When Ghanaians say \"You are welcome\", they say it as if they really mean it. The country may have changed out of recognition in 40 years, but, as my father and I were pleased to note, the people remain as warm as ever. 'The abandoned fort that was my office stands lapped by the sea' Michael Ensor Ghana, well endowed at the time of independence and with a stable currency, soon descended, as the result of reduced earnings from cocoa and other exports and mismanagement, into an economic trough from which it is only now starting to climb. The inflation that its currency underwent is reflected today in the fact that the highest denomination of banknote is worth around Â£1. As a result, in a country where credit cards are not widely accepted, the traveller is put to the inconvenience of having to carry a thick bundle of notes. Women used to play a major part in Ghana's retail trade, enjoying a monopoly of the market in foodstuffs and textiles. So much so that when fishermen brought their catch to the beach, it was at once taken over by their women. With the spread of girls' education, women have moved upwards to play an important part in the more complex commercial sector. After several coups, political stability seems to have returned with a president and legislature elected by a system the revision of whose mechanism was my last task in Ghana. But it is still thought prudent to maintain frequent police road checks, which are not only for the detection of traffic offences, and to restrict photography in unlikely places. The greatest improvement that I perceived came from the increasingly widespread supply of electricity from the hydro-electric plant below the Volta dam. As well as providing illumination, it powers village water supplies and cornmills, which is a boon for women. How my wife would have appreciated the end of oil lamps during our postings away from headquarters. Now air-conditioning improves the comfort of visitors. There can be few Ghanaians who still feel that the flooding of nearly 10% of the country was too high a price to pay. Ghana's road network has been greatly extended and this has enabled more outlying farmers to produce food for urban markets as well as subsistence crops. To the east of Accra, a second bridge replacing the ferry across the lower Volta together with improvements to trunk roads have halved many journey times. But secondary roads are as unreliable as I remember them, especially in the rainy season. A development that saddened me was the harm that had been done to Ghana's palm-fringed coastline by the ravages of a disease of coconut palms that leaves unsightly frond-less trunks. Added to this, marine erosion has washed away much of Keta, where the abandoned remains of the attractive 18th-century Danish fort that was my office and court stand lapped by the sea that has cut the coastal road to the east and is threatening to break through to the lagoon.

I am only sorry that it takes place in something some way short of a party atmosphere, despite all that we have to celebrate ten years on from your founding. During this time, the island of Ireland has become a safer, more harmonious and prosperous place. Ireland in the North has a transformed security situation. Ireland in the South has acquired a modern economic brand image. The potential for both is huge and I have a deep sense of personal commitment to entrenching Ireland's security and prosperity, North and South. We owe nothing less to the people we represent and serve. It was, therefore, with a heavy heart that on Friday I took a step I had hoped would not prove to be necessary and suspended temporarily the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement. I hope that the suspension will be short. I intend it to be. But it was, even so, a move that the British and Irish Governments, in constant touch with the political parties, pulled out all the stops to avert. If we had found any way of securing enough confidence for the institutions to continue we would have taken it. The bedrock of the Good Friday Agreement is cross-community support. Without a consensus across the political spectrum, its institutions cannot be sustained. It is not a matter of taking one side or the other. The only side that I am on is that of the Agreement as a whole and the interests of both traditions invested in it. Decommissioning is not a unionist or a British fixation. The statements of John Hume and Seamus Mallon confirm that, as do the calls made by President Clinton and Senator Kennedy. Nor is it an issue only in the minds of politicians. It has been called for by Protestant and Catholic, from all corners of Ireland, north and south. That it must happen is agreed by leader-writers from the Newsletter to the Irish News to the Boston Globe. And I do not just mean republican decommissioning. The onus is on every paramilitary to dispose of their illegally held arms for politics to work properly. Such was the overwhelming desire for progress that Bishop Heggarty was prepared to help personally and I commend his bold initiative. It was, and remains, a crucial part of building consensus, a signal that paramilitaries - from all sides - were committed to playing their part in building a new, peaceful Northern Ireland. On Friday, there was one very positive development. After I had signed the Order suspending the institutions, we received a report from General John de Chastelain's decommissioning commission. The Commission reported that the IRA had indicated the context in which they would initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use. In the Commission's view, this held out the real prospect of an agreement which would enable it to fulfil the substance of its mandate. I do not for a moment underestimate the significance of this. If it means what it appears to mean, it may be the first sign that the IRA are , after all, prepared to give up their arms. We need to find out what the context is in which the IRA says it will put arms beyond use. Brian Cowen and I intend to follow this up urgently, first by exploring with General de Chastelain what lies behind Friday's report. But, in the situation we faced on Friday, it was too unspecific and it came too late. It provides the basis for answering Seamus Mallon's \"whether\" question, but not his \"when\" question or \"how\". Had it come earlier, we could have sought, and possibly received, greater clarity. But, as it was, with the institutions on the point of collapse, I had no choice but to act as I did - as I said I would - under the review provisions of the Agreement. Some have said that I acted in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. On the contrary, I acted to save the Agreement as the two governments said they would in the conclusions of the Mitchell accord. The consensus necessary for the institutions to continue simply did not exist. Though convinced that this step was the right one, it was with great sadness that I took it. The institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement have proved to be the most effective, most democratic form of government that Northern Ireland has ever known. I rejoice in the fact that there are no longer strangers, no more outsiders from Northern Ireland's administration. Northern Ireland finally had a truly representative Executive, with members drawn from all the major pro-agreement parties and including two of its opponents. It underlines that there are not second class citizens in Northern Ireland any more. It had local Ministers, with local accents and deep local knowledge. With the power to make decisions that affect the daily lives of local people. And each and every one of those Ministers, regardless of political affiliation, have fulfilled our highest expectations: that they are the right people to govern Northern Ireland. Government of Northern Ireland from outside Northern Ireland is inferior to inclusive self government of Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement created a framework of north-south institutions for practical co-operation between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This means greater co-operation and better services not just for Northern Ireland but for the whole island of Ireland. And East-West arrangements that will broaden and deepen relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom and throughout the United Kingdom. Sadly these, too, are now on hold. But not indefinitely. I do not want direct rule to continue for a moment longer than necessary. That's why the talks that Brian Cowen and I are initiating with the parties today are so urgent. In the last 72 hours, some harsh words have been spoken. That is perhaps not surprising. Huge issues are at stake. And yes, at times, there are differences of emphasis between us. There is a keen sense of loss, which extends beyond Northern Ireland and beyond these islands, among all those who support the Agreement and want it to succeed. But this process has worked best when we have all worked together, while honestly recognising the difference between us. I appeal to all the parties to work with the Irish Government and ourselves, without reservation or precondition, to create the conditions needed to reactivate Northern Ireland's devolved government. To seek the necessary clarity. To move forward together. Any less wholehearted approach will not be understood or forgiven by the people of Northern Ireland. They take pride and delight in the huge progress which has been made in recent years. Ceasefires well established. A peace which is still not perfect, but is infinitely better than what went before. And I do not underestimate the courage and effort it has taken on all sides for that to be achieved. A remarkably settled consensus about the constitutional questions that have dogged the last thirty years. The emergence of new institutions in which both traditions play a full part. The pursuit of an active agenda on rights and equality. This is not an agenda of \"political correctness\". I am no fan of gesture politics. But the generosity of spirit and imagination on all sides that have got us this far must not fail us now. Taking the necessary final steps - and risks - on the way means each side understanding the mindset of the other. It means, in particular, republicans understanding better why unionists are reluctant to join in government without more definitive progress on the arms issue. Why the fact that the guns are silent, welcome as it is, is not enough. And all of us understanding better why arms have the almost totemic significance they have for those who hold them. Above all, it means the avoidance of any suggestion of surrender or climbdown on either side. There will be dissidents on both sides who do not want us to succeed. But we should not be afraid of the men and women whose gaze is firmly backwards, whose justification is some eccentric notion that nations can be built on violence and intimidation and cite a spurious analysis of history in support. Or equally, those who refuse to admit that change is either possible or desirable. Those who prefer the certainties of past conflict to the uncertainties of future reconciliation. They have not deterred us in the past and they never will. That's why I am committed, as I was before devolution, to good government in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland, irrespective of their tradition or political allegiance. That's why I propose to continue to advance the programmes of positive reform that flow from the Good Friday Agreement. Because the Good Friday Agreement envisaged not just a new constitution, but fundamental changes to the political and social fabric of Northern Ireland. The Agreement has given Northern Ireland some of the most sophisticated rights and equality arrangements in the world. But rights cannot simply be tacked on to the systems and institutions of government - we must actively seek new and imaginative ways to encourage respect for rights and equality in every area of public life. Everywhere from employment to policing and parades - all areas that must advance regardless of the state of political progress. I have faced calls to suspend the implementation of the Patten report on policing while the institutions are on hold. This is just not possible. In the words of the Chief Constable 'the vast bulk of the recommendations are simply about good and effective policing'. Policing is not a partisan issue to be traded as if it were part of some political scoresheet and it must not be used to give comfort to any political party. I have not done that to date and I am not going to start now, however much I respect the right of any politician to express their view on the subject. I know the passions that reform of the RUC arouses, particularly the prospect of a new name and changed badge. I have heard at first hand, many times, the harrowing stories of how these symbols have come to mean so much to so many people in the RUC family who experienced tragedy. But a nine to one religious imbalance cannot be allowed to continue. A police service that is not representative of the society it serves cannot hope to be fully effective. It cannot hope to draw support and strength from all parts of the community. We must not rest until all the pillars of the state command the same respect, inspire the same sense of ownership across the community in Northern Ireland. Until the state and its agencies truly are representative of and responsive to the society it serves. So much, though, has changed already in a positive direction in Northern Ireland. And you in the BIIPB have seen at close quarters the great advances that the last ten years have brought. From terrible violence, political instability and little hope of anything better. I am determined to work harder still to build confidence in the Good Friday Agreement and to create the conditions for the swift return of devolved government. And I will do all I can to encourage the incremental shifts that have brought ceasefires, then the Good Friday Agreement, then devolution. The shifts that will one day secure truly democratic government and an unbreakable peace in Northern Ireland. Those are our goals. And we need each other - indeed, unionists need nationalists who need republicans who need unionists - to achieve those goals. That recognition was the mainspring of the Good Friday Agreement. It remains so. It is what will carry us forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/15/stansted.theairlineindustry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-15T02:06:46Z","webTitle":"Freed hostages tell of 'infidel' Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/15/stansted.theairlineindustry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/15/stansted.theairlineindustry","fields":{"headline":"Freed hostages tell of 'infidel' Britain","bodyText":"Thirteen men appeared in court yesterday accused of seizing the Boeing 727 at the centre of the Stansted airport hijack drama, while 73 of the freed passengers voluntarily returned to Aghanistan, apparently calling Britain a damp and \"infidel\" nation. The accused men, all Afghan nationals aged between 18 and 36, appeared at Southend magistrates court and were charged under section one of the Aviation Security Act 1982. The charge said that \"within the jurisdiction of the central criminal court they unlawfully and by use of force or threat seized aircraft Boeing 727 YA-FAY and its passengers\". In an hour-long hearing they appeared in three separate groups, all bearded and wearing 1970s-style prison-issue track suits in navy, marine blue or green, and slippers. At least one man was said to have a wife and child on board the plane, and all are believed to be seeking political asylum. The men, including two sets of brothers, heard the proceedings through Farsi and Pashtoo interpreters, although some of the accused answered \"yes\" in English to the magistrate. None applied for bail. The stipendiary magistrate Kevin Gray remanded the 13 in custody and adjourned the committal proceedings until March 13 at 9.45am. Earlier yesterday, half of the freed Afghan hostages, trapped in the aircraft from February 6-10, landed at Afghanistan's spiritual capital Kandahar, and spoke of their ordeal and of \"infidel\" Britain. Despite stopping at the Stansted Hilton, one said: \"It is not a Muslim country, how could we stay? The weather was depressing and the food was awful.\" Mohammed Latif Nasri, a ground engineer who was on board the plane, added: \"They requested that they stay in the United Kingdom. That was their only demand.\" Another said: \"They have nothing to do with politics.\" The Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, looked embarrassed as he met the freed hostages at Kandahar airport. He has sought to play down the idea that those on the plane were trying to escape the Taliban's strict Islamic government. The defendants appearing at Southend were named as Muhammad Sediqui, 36; Abdul Showaib, 20; Mohammad Safi, 32; Ali Safi, 34; Mohammad Sediqui, 30; Khalil Ullah, 30; Muhammad Kazem, 27; Waheed Lufti, 22; Reshad Ahmodi, 18; Nazamuddin Mohammidy, 26; Mohammed Showaib, 25; Taimur Shah, 28; and Ghayur Abdul, 24. The charged men were represented in court by three barristers and six solicitors. Kenneth Carr, acting for two of the defendants but supported by all counsel, made an application in camera for the men's names to be withheld from publication under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act. After hearing arguments for about two hours, the magistrate rejected the request. The men are understood to fear that their families in Afghanistan will be persecuted by the Taliban once their names are made public. One legal source said: \"These aren't militants, they are just ordinary guys.\" Police yesterday also released without charge a further six men after questioning, and they were to join other passengers waiting for asylum applications to be processed in Moreton in the Marsh, Gloucestershire. But another man was arrested at the temporary immigration centre in the same town and returned to Essex for questioning on suspicion of being involved in the hijack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/17/marktran","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-17T12:24:35Z","webTitle":"Prescott's air traffic privatisation bid savaged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/17/marktran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/17/marktran","fields":{"headline":"Prescott's air traffic privatisation bid savaged","bodyText":"A committee of MPs today savaged government plans to sell off part of Britain's air traffic control system. The proposed public-private partnership would be the \"worst possible option\" for the future of national air traffic services (NATS), the environment, transport and regional affairs committee argued. In a blunt report, the cross-party committee warned that a private company would \"very likely\" have to raise charges or cut costs - both moves which would \"jeopardise safety\". John Prescott, the secretary of state for transport, announced in June 1998 that the government planned to sell 46% of NATS to a \"strategic\" private partner, with 5% going to staff, and the remaining 49% retained in the public sector. NATS argued that the sale would allow the investment it needed - estimated at Â£1.3bn over the next 10 years - to cope with a forecasted 43% rise in air traffic by 2010. But the sell-off plan, part of the transport bill going through parliament, has run into heavy flak. The British Airline Pilots Association and some Labour MPs, including the former transport minister Gavin Strang, have attacked the idea. The committee said that if the government wrote off NATS' debt of Â£300m, the expected Â£350m proceeds from the proposed sale would result in revenue of \"only Â£20m\" after Â£30mcosts. It is also anticipated that some of the public shares would not have voting rights which would, in effect, pass \"operational control\" of the organisation into private hands. The committee agreed that making no change to NATS was not an option because it was already operating ''close to the limit of its capacity\", but it urged the government to consider making NATS an independent trust. \"In no other country is a public-private partnership like that proposed for the UK planned,\" it noted. The committee pointed to the success of Canada's NavCanada, funded by a bonds issue and governed by 15 directors, including five from the aviation industry, two from the unions and three from the government. The committee said the trust model would free NATS to borrow on the private market, and separate the company more clearly from its regulator, the civil aviation authority. It argued: \"Since customers, staff and the government would all be involved in the provision of air traffic services, the trust model answers concerns about rising charges, lower safety standards, national security considerations, and the future development of air navigation services.\" The committee also warned that private investors would want to increase revenues from NATS by raising charges to its customers, putting airlines and airports in the United Kingdom at a competitive disadvantage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/17/freedomofinformation.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-17T16:05:33Z","webTitle":"Cannabis goes for ecstasy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/17/freedomofinformation.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/17/freedomofinformation.politics","fields":{"headline":"Cannabis goes for ecstasy","bodyText":"Britain's drug barons are exporting home grown, high grade cannabis to Holland in exchange for Dutch manufactured ecstasy tablets, American intelligence officers have warned the home office. The US drug enforcement agency has told Paul Boateng, the home office minister, that Britain is now one of the top centres for growing \"nederweed\" - a superior grade of cannabis which is 30% stronger than the standard drug on the market. It is grown in illegal laboratories using strong lights and water to aid its growth. Details are revealed in a previously secret report given to Mr Boateng last summer when he held talks in Washington with Donnie Marshall, the deputy US drug tsar. They were released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act. The equivalent British documents for the meeting will remain secret until 2030. The report - prepared by US intelligence officers who monitor Europe's illegal drug trade - says the export trade is a recent development which builds on Britain's growing reputation in the drugs world for growing superior weed. It says that customs officers are already worried that Britain is being flooded with nederweed grown in Holland - but now Britain seems to have a big enough home grown market to export it back to the Netherlands. \"Cannabis is the most abused drug in the United Kingdom. Customs and Excise reports seizing an all-time record 82.5 metric tonnes of cannabis in the United Kingdom in 1997,\" says the report. The trade was often carried out by air rather than through the ports. And Colombia - traditionally one of Britain's top suppliers of cocaine - has recently become a big supplier for traditional strength marijuana. \"In a relatively short period of time Colombia has become an important marijuna source country for the UK.\" Most of the cannabis was imported by ship rather than by air. Yesterday customs and excise made it clear that cannabis was still a top target. \"I think the figures speak for themselves,\" said a spokeswoman.

Indeed, it is widely thought to have been one of the factors responsible for the downfall of John Major's government. Three senior Conservative politicians, the cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, and the junior ministers Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith, were found guilty of serious financial improprieties, and their political careers ended as a result. In 1994, following allegations that two Conservative backbenchers, David Tredinnick and Graham Riddick, had accepted money for asking parliamentary questions, public disquiet led to the formation of a standing committee on standards in public life. Yet from a continental perspective, these scandals must appear almost inconsequential. British sleaze has on the whole been confined to those not in the political front rank. Moreover, sleaze in Britain, since the days of Lloyd George, has never involved senior government ministers, much less heads of government. There has been nothing like the massive money laundering and misuse of patronage of which Helmut Kohl, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Bettino Craxi have been accused. So why are we so comparatively free of sleaze? Britain is often seen as a political system dominated by the party. Yet in truth, party patronage pays a much smaller role here than it does on the continent. In Italy the \"southernisation\" of the civil service resulted in 350,000 people being recruited through patronage between 1973 and 1990, as compared with 250,000 recruited by a competitive examination. In Austria - an extreme example - public posts, including teaching appointments, have long been divided among the two main parties, the Social Democrats and the People's party. Indeed, popular resentment of this practice was one of the main factors responsible for JÃ¶rg Haider's rise to power. In Britain, by contrast, there is a firm line demar cating political authority, derived from success in competitive elections, from administrative authority, derived from success in competitive examinations. The civil service remains a career service, founded on the values of political neutrality and impartiality. Special advisers - who comprise about 70 of the 2,500 senior civil servants - have no executive authority; while appointments to quangos, which are by and large semi-official bodies without executive powers, are generally short-term. As a result, political parties can do little to reward their supporters; a seat in the House of Lords or an honour is perhaps the most that can be offered. Tony Blair, however, is divesting himself of patronage in the House of Lords by placing the nomination of cross-bench peers into the hands of an independent appointments committee. The proposals of the committee on standards in public life, currently the subject of legislation to introduce greater transparency in party funding, are also likely to limit the scope of patronage. Sunlight, said the US supreme court justice Louis Dembitz Brandeis, is the best disinfectant. With much to teach our counterparts on the continent, how sad it is that successive Eurosceptic governments have weakened our regional prestige.

You couldn't say no, for a start, because Hearst was big in Hollywood as well as newspapers and could break the career of anyone who crossed him. Then there were all the restrictions: you couldn't bring your own maid, you weren't allowed as much as a cup of coffee in the guest rooms, and if you wanted to sleep with your boyfriend or girlfriend, forget it: Hearst co-habited with his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, but wouldn't let other unmarried couples share a room. And so it went on. The pre-dinner drinks, according to David Niven, \"flowed like glue\". Anyone who managed to get drunk - Errol Flynn and Dorothy Parker were two lucky ones - would return to their rooms to find their bags packed and a car waiting to take them to the station. \"Life in this Hearstian empire,\" wrote the socialite Gloria Vanderbilt, \"is lived according to the disciplinary measures laid down by its dictator.\" There were a few dissidents, such as the guest who, when asked one morning if he wanted to ride, motor, shoot, golf, swim or play tennis, replied firmly: \"Not if I can help it.\" And it seems that when Hearst retired to his library to telegram instructions to his newspapers deep into the night, the more spirited guests would sneak off to the steamy, gold-tiled indoor pool for boozy parties. Hearst indulged his every whim, and the eminent San Francisco architect Julia Morgan patiently went along with it all, year after year. The swimming pool was rebuilt three times, the foundations of the main house were moved at huge expense to make room for a bowling alley that was never built. Davies and some of the women guests often did jigsaw puzzles in the Assembly Room after dinner, and on one occasion a skilled carpenter and painter were brought in to make a perfect replacement for a tiny lost piece. \"Afterwards, nine chances out of 10, it was shoved in the wastepapaper basket,\" the carpenter commented later. Nowadays, the hordes of mass tourism have taken the place of the beautiful people at Hearst Castle, but a whiff of the old man's authoritarianism lingers on. As you move across glittering terraces and through dim interiors, you're tailed by a dark man in mirrored sunglasses: just checking you're not lifting the marble statue of Galatea or tucking a prize rug under your arm. The worst touch on our visit came when we went to a movie called Building the Dream, a sycophantic account of how Hearst came to create this great monument to extravagance and vanity. The flunkey with the task of switching it on declined to do so until the audience, like a kindergarten chorus, had said good morning to him in the approved manner: not if I can help it. You learn, as you troop from room to room, that the 14th- and 15th-century Gothic ceilings came mainly from Spain, that the huge 400-year-old stone fireplace in the Assembly Room was made in Burgundy, that the four tapestries on the wall were woven from wool and silk in Flanders, that the 600-year-old choir stalls came from a Spanish monastery, that there are 155 Greek vases in the Gothic library. The jumble becomes most absurd when you reach the coffee room and the adjoining billiard hall, where there are 1,700-year-old Roman mosaics close to a 15th- century Spanish ceiling, a 16th-century tapestry of a stag hunt from northern France, and the 1930s billiard tables. The loot of the world arrived here by the shipload. Often it was never unpacked, let alone looked at. But one thing you won't find mentioned in the official guidebooks is the Orson Welles film, Citizen Kane, in which a super-rich newspaper magnate fails to achieve his political ambitions and tries to console himself by building a huge castle. There was never any doubt that the character of Kane started with Hearst, who had twice failed to become mayor of New York and win the Democratic presidential nomination. The great man instructed his columnists to attack Welles and used his influence in Hollywood to try to block the film's distribution. It was, he claimed, \"Communist inspired\". Welles issued a statement denying he was a Communist, praising the American political system and adding: \"It is not necessarily unpatriotic to disagree with Mr Hearst.\" But there were probably more differences than similarities between the fictional Charles Foster Kane and the real life William Randolph Hearst. In particular, the central device of the film - that Kane's psychological scar comes from his deprivation in early childhood of his beloved snowsled Rosebud - seems to have had very little to do with Hearst, who had never been deprived of anything. (The story that Rosebud was Hearst's pet name for Marion Davies's clitoris is widely regarded as a red herring.) Film writer David Thomson argues in his book Rosebud that Kane's complicated, self-destructive character is closer to Welles himself than Hearst: \"Some other resemblance developed behind the showy but superficial kinship of Kane and Hearst. In emotion and energy, Kane was based on Welles. No one who knew or has written about Hearst has ever reported such complex depths, such an air of the damned.\" But the message that gives the film so much of its impact - the ultimate emptiness of power, wealth and ambition, and the limitations of the American dream - seems to hover in the air around Hearst Castle. The place is a triumph of money, willpower and acquisition, but all the time a little voice whispers: what on earth is it all for? There are many beautiful things at the castle. The site is stunningly beautiful, 2,000ft above the Pacific on what Hearst liked to call La Cuesta Encantada, the Enchanted Hill. (The website refers to it as La Cuesta Encantada.) But as the tour bus takes you back down the winding road to the shoreline, through the grounds once inhabited by the 300 animals of his private zoo, it is hard to find any meaning in it all.

The first blast furnaces at Shelton were built by the Marquis of Stafford in 1841, right next to the Trent-Mersey canal and the rich local seams of coal and iron ore. The first mill was installed 10 years later. At its peak before the Second World War, the Shelton Iron, Steel and Coal Company ran eight furnaces, four collieries, mills, batteries of coking ovens and steam locomotives. And by the time the present mill was commissioned in 1966, the works employed 3,500 people. But like Corby in Northamptonshire and Ravenscraig on Clydeside, the area's fortunes have been ravaged by industry overcapacity. Shelton had already lost control of its coal mines when the steel industry was first taken into state ownership in 1951 (a move reversed two years later). Then, after the second nationalisation - which created British Steel in 1967 - the works was progressively cut back until, in 1978, the final blast furnace closed. The site was finally cleared in 1986 and became the venue for Britain's second national Garden Festival. 'It was a tragedy for the whole area and the 7,500 people inside and outside the works whose livelihood depended on it,' said Stan Walley, 82, who worked at Shelton for 31 years. After the privatisation of British Steel in 1989, the remaining rolling mill at Shelton - supplied with steel first from Scunthorpe and then from Teesside - was always thought vulnerable. But, producing 450,000 tonnes of sections for the construction industry each year, it remained one of British Steel's most productive plants. Over the past few years, Â£10 million has been spent on computerising and modernising the three-quarter-mile-long production line. Last June, as the pound's strength continued to bite, the unions agreed to 105 job cuts - a third of the remaining work force - with flexible teamworking and 12-hour shifts. In return, they gained assurances that Shelton had a future despite the downturn. Corus performance charts seen by The Observer on a visit to the plant bear out claims by the union that the mill is still one of the firm's most efficient. In December, however, just weeks after the merger, Corus dropped its bombshell: the plant would shut and the last 216 jobs would go by the end of April. 'They feel betrayed. I certainly do,' said former ISTC union official Harry Cooper, who left in the first round of redundancies. 'The union and workers did everything possible to work with the management. We knew we had to be the best to survive, otherwise they'd close the plant. Now they've broken the assurance they gave.'

They say Â£320 million would have been spent on the region anyway. The SNP have leapt on the admission as proof of its argument that the Treasury man-ipulates structural funds to suit UK spending targets. The row has erupted following the resignation of Alun Michael as the First Minister in Wales. He lost the confidence of a cross-party alliance in Cardiff who felt he wasn't fighting hard enough for a fair distribution of Euro funds with the Treasury. The SNP has argued for some time that Scotland does not receive a fair and full deal from the Treasury in terms of European structural funds. Admiring the 'unanimity' of Welsh political parties in calling for their fair share of Euro funds, SNP leader Alex Salmond has written to all party leaders in Scotland and Wales suggesting they form a united front. The main Nationalist argument is that the Scottish assigned budget, formerly known as the Scottish block, does not properly reflect the full amount of European structural funds allocated to Scotland. The Scottish Executive says that the row in Wales is because the country has had a huge injection of European matching funds. These require complementary sums from the United Kingdom Treasury to be accessed. Scotland, being richer than Wales, does not have an equivalent problem.

She became an actress in the 30s when acting was still taboo for respectable women. Her father Prabhakar Shilotri owned his own bank, but her mother, Kantabai Shilotri, had acted in silent films. Shobhana made her debut opposite Master Vinayak in Nigah-e-Nafrat (Eye of Hatred, 1935) but it was playing the female lead in Sagar Films's Do Diwane (The Two Love Crazy, 1936) and Kokila (Nightingale, 1937) that gained her early popularity. Her roles in films about mythology made her a star: as the goddess Sita (wife of Lord Rama) in Vijay Bhatt's Bharat Milap (The Meeting of Bharat, 1942) and in his Ram Rajya (The Ideal Rule of Rama, 1943), a film that unreeled the saga of Lord Rama's ideal kingdom. Her impact was so powerful that viewers showered coins and flowers when she appeared on the screen. A private screening of Ram Rajya was even arranged for Mahatma Gandhi, an admirer of Rama's philosophy. Shobhana played similar mythological roles in Mahasati Anasuya (The Venerable Anasuya, 1943), Urvashi (1946) and many more. So deep was the popular identification of Shobhana with the goddess Sita that she began to appear in comic books, calendar paintings and even on posters for the rightist Hindu Movement Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Although these parts turned her into a celebrity, they limited her as an actress and they were far removed from her life offscreen, which was noted for its careless disregard for convention. Although her husband, cinematographer Kumarsen Samarth, had initially been her mentor, she gradually grew apart from him and developed an intimate relationship with Motilal, one of the most accomplished actors of Indian cinema. \"It was a wonderful relationship... He had a flying licence hired a plane and flew over my cottage, throwing stones with letters tied to them saying 'I love you', \" recalled Shobhana in one of her last interviews. She played the lead in nearly 50 films and eventually became a producer, setting up Shobhana Pictures, and director of two films, Hamari Beti (Our Daughter, 1950) and Chhabili (Beautiful Woman, 1960), which launched her daughters, Nutan and Tanuja, as actresses. She leaves behind a family that is now centre screen of Indian cinema. Nutan has appeared in films by Zia Sarhadi and Bimal Roy; Tanuja is a talented actress in both Hindi and regional cinema; a grand-daughter, Kajol, is one of India's top stars; a grandson, Mohinish Behl, is also an actor. Shobhana is also survived by a son, Jaideep. â¢ Shobhana Samarth, actress, producer and director, born November 17 1916 ; died February 9 2000"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/22/ladbrokegrove.transport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-22T02:07:07Z","webTitle":"Rail victim's mother rages at safety failings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/22/ladbrokegrove.transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/22/ladbrokegrove.transport","fields":{"headline":"Rail victim's mother rages at safety failings","bodyText":"The mother of a woman killed in the Paddington rail crash yesterday blamed inadequate safety measures for the death of her daughter, and demanded that the accident be the last of its kind on Britain's railways. Birgit Andersen told the jury on the opening day of the inquest into the deaths of the 31 accident victims that the crash could have been prevented. Her daughter Charlotte, 32, was among those killed when a three-coach Thames Turbo service from Paddington to Slough collided with a First Great Western train from Cheltenham travelling in the opposite direction. The Thames train is believed to have passed through a red signal shortly before the collision at Ladbroke Grove, two miles outside Paddington station. Mrs Andersen said: \"On the morning of October 5 1999 she [Charlotte] was killed in a crash which I believe could have been prevented. She lost her life due to lack of safety measures. \"Her sister, her father and I were robbed that morning at 8.11am. We feel angry as well as worried and feel it is a matter of time before more lives are lost in a similar accident if safety is not improved. \"I plead that the dead of Ladbroke Grove be honoured by ensuring that this does not happen again. We will never hear her voice again and we will never see her smile again,\" she said, before handing a picture of her daughter to the jury. Mrs Andersen, who flew from her home in Virginia in the US with her husband Per and youngest daughter Tina to give evidence to the inquest, added that she had thought her daughter would be safe in Britain. \"My daughter ... lived, studied, travelled and worked in many places around the world, including Europe and America, and many which I considered under-developed,\" she said. \"I used to worry about her safety but when she began to work in the United Kingdom three years ago I felt no need to worry. Then she commuted to work by Thames train from Paddington to Slough.\" Charlotte was living in Notting Hill, west London, and working as a product manager in Slough. She is thought to have been sitting in the front carriage of the Thames train. Her body was thrown from the carriage on impact. Speaking outside the court, Charlotte's father vowed to do everything in his power to ensure that \"the responsible authorities are brought to court\". Earlier the inquest heard from the first police and fire officers to arrive at the scene. Detective Superintendent Patrick Bracken, the senior investigating officer, said that the two trains collided when the Thames train attempted to join the down main line heading away from London, crossing the path of the Great Western train. The combined impact speed was around 100mph, he said. Fireman Richard Hodson, chief of North Kensington fire station, said that the first two fire engines at the scene were prevented from getting to the crash site by an electronic security fence protecting a Eurostar depot alongside the track. He scaled the fence and ran down to the wreckage, where he found a scene of devastation. In a statement read to the inquest by the coroner, Paul Knapman, Mr Hodson said: \"I was confronted with a situation the enormity of which took my breath away.\" In total, 228 people were sent to hospital and 296 received first aid at the scene. Some 319 police officers from the Metropolitan and British Transport police attended the scene, along with 152 firefighters and 31 ambulances and 20 other vehicles and crews from the ambulance service. Dr Knapman indicated the inquest was likely to be adjourned after evidence regarding the death of all 31 victims. Lord Cullen's inquiry into the crash is due to begin hearing evidence next month, and an investigation by British Transport police is continuing. The inquest continues today. Hearing told how eight were killed Yesterday the inquest heard details of the deaths of eight of the people killed in the crash: Khawar Tauheed, 44 A microbiologist, Dr Tauheed was born in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 1986. He was married with two children and was travelling in the front carriage of the Thames train. Cause of death: Head injuries and smoke inhalation. Death was instantaneous. Anthony Beeton, 47 Married with two children, Mr Beeton was an adviser to Mo Mowlam at the Northern Ireland office. He boarded the Great Western train at Didcot, and took his normal seat in a rear carriage. On the approach to Paddington, as he did every morning, he walked to the front of the train. His body was thrown from the front coach into the power car. Cause of death: Head and pelvic injuries. Death instantaneous. John Northcott, 24 Mr Northcott, an IT consultant from Leyton, was in the front carriage of the Thames train heading to Slough. Cause of death: Multiple head injuries. \"He suffered a form of brain damage,\" said pathologist Iain West. Charlotte Andersen, 32 Ms Andersen was in the front carriage of the Thames train, and was thrown onto the tracks. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Death instantaneous. Sean Donoghue, 45 A statistician from New Cross, Mr Donoghue was also on the Thames train. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Derek Antonowitz, 25 A computer consultant born in Harare, Mr Antonowitz had been in Britain three months when he died on the Thames train. Cause of death: Injuries to head, chest and abdomen. Ola Bratlie, 26 A Norwegian telecommunications engineer living in north-west London, she was also on board the Thames train. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Death instantaneous. Delroy Manning, 39 A plasterer from Lewisham, Mr Manning was married with two children. He had been travelling to a new job he was due to start that morning in Ealing, west London.

There is the New Deal to get 18 to 24-year-olds into work, Youth Offending Teams, and new help for those leaving council care. Recently, a national Youth Support Service under the brand name Connexions was announced. It is intended to \"re-connect\" young people and education, seen as the main avenue for including them into society. Now employment minister Tessa Jowell is also looking at the transition to adulthood of young people at risk as part of the 2000 comprehensive spending review. Increasingly the Blair government sees that substantially the same group of marginalised or excluded young people - roughly 10% of the age cohort - are at risk of homelessness, offending, lack of basic skills, unemployment, dependency and early pregnancy. They are on the receiving end of too many uncoordinated interventions with too few positive outcomes. Young people in the United Kingdom get a worse start than many of their contemporaries elsewhere in Europe. As the chart shows, the UK is near the bottom of the European league in the proportion of young people leaving school with low level qualifications, the proportion of 18-year-olds still in education and the numbers of young homeless. Becoming a self-sufficient adult is harder than it was 20 years ago. Then, nearly half of school leavers went straight into jobs - now it is less than one in ten. It is alarming, too, how homelessness, unwanted pregnancy and drug and alcohol abuse affect ever younger people. The mean age at which cannabis gets used has fallen from 15 to 12; for heroin from 17 to 15. During the past five years there has been a significant rise in the number of homeless 16 and 17-year-olds, some from local authority care, but many more from families who feel their responsibility comes to an end when the child reaches 16. Studies of young men in prison show their association with homelessness, with local authority care, with exclusion from school, lack of skills, unemployment and drug use - also how many of them are or are about to become fathers. The new support scheme promises a lot. Connexions will be largely delivered by existing local authority careers and youth services, also by schools' and colleges' welfare services, by probation officers, social services and voluntary organisations. By starting to work with 13-year-olds Connexions ought to be able to bridge the trench between pre and post-16 provision. This is important, not just to be able to track problems in younger and younger age groups, but because things that happen or fail to happen at school are often strong predictors of later problems. The Safe in the Cities project identified school exclusion as a significant predictor of subsequent homelessness, though not a cause. Connexions might make young people excluded from school aware of local housing options: when they leave home it is planned, cutting the risk that they end up sleeping rough. Connexions is meant to be a single service with a single point of contact - the \"personal adviser\". But these advisers cannot just sit and wait for problems. Connexions is going to have to seek out young people, using the skills of the variety of voluntary organisations trying to help young people. For homeless young people the Social Exclusion Unit recognised that organisations such as Foyers - voluntary schemes that house and encourage young people to re-engage with employment - are already doing the Connexions job and should be given the status as well. If the government's ambitions are going to be realised attitudes will have to shift. Young people themselves are going to have to be brought into planning and maybe also delivering the service. A Carnegie Foundation study showed that young people felt services were often not open at the right hours nor offer what they wanted. Con nexions has to take their views seriously just as private companies routinely base decisions on market research. Technology has a part in all this. As well as a medium for service delivery it could be the acid that dissolves the organisational \"silos\" in which many Connexions advisers may be bottled up in their disciplines and hierarchies. Shared use of the internet and email could create a virtual organisation of personal advisers developing a shared understanding of problems outside their \"patch\" and a shared goal of promoting young adults' learning as an overlay on their separate professional goals. Of course money matters. The new national youth support service implies a massive shift of resources towards the 10% who have tended to receive little attention from those agencies charged with increasing educational participation. There should be efficiency gains from organisations working more effectively together, but the increased emphasis on working with the most problematic part of the cohort, with low caseloads, will require several times the Â£220m budget of the careers service. A total of Â£500m has been talked about: this is the minimum required. While some of this will be existing money the logic of Connexions requires significant new money as well. This is where Tessa Jowell's review ought to make the treasury use a long ruler. Payback for a better youth service could take years to show. Moreover the costs of reaching and connecting could easily grow, the more successful the scheme is. Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, has recently re-committed the government to its target of abolishing child poverty within 20 years. That depends on getting parents into work that is skilled and secure. Better service for youth now is about the skills and qualities of parents tomorrow. It is time to start investing: the performance of tomorrow's parents depend on better services for young people today. â¢ Carolyn Hayman is chief executive of the Foyers Federation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/feb/24/comment","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-24T10:13:17Z","webTitle":"The best critical judgment scene: Topsy-Turvy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/24/comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/feb/24/comment","fields":{"headline":"The best critical judgment scene: Topsy-Turvy","bodyText":"The morning after the opening night of his and Sullivan's Princess Ida, WS Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) stands in his drawing room scanning the papers.

It seemed an obvious pairing, yet few papers made the connection. Nor did they ask their political heavyweights to assess the daunting thesis - that our current political arrangements are unsustainable. Perhaps the burlesque of the London mayoral race has diverted eyes from the more important issues. Of the two, Andrew Marr's The Day Britain Died (Profile Books, Â£7.99) gained more attention (the fact that it was backed by a TV series may have helped). Marr is one of Britain's - we can, presumably, still use that term - most insightful commentators, as fellow pundit Matthew Parris made clear in the Times. \"When one learns that the author has 'travelled around the country', 'meeting people', the heart sinks,\" he wrote. \"Meeting which people? Who chose them? Why? But then the eye moves to the author's name: Andrew Marr. The heart lifts. This will be the product of a real mind, a singular literary flair, an integrity still intact. Such an author is capable of stamping a book - maybe even a television series - with an idea.\" And, he concludes, Marr has. \"Shorn of the many intriguing sideways insights the author provides, the central idea is simple, powerful, and finally persuasive: Englishness exists. England's senses of itself go back more than a thousand years, albeit in different forms, and unless England is recognised and given a new sense of its own security, then all hopes for a liberal, open, democratic and tolerant future are in danger... Yet England has been pushed into a corner where it is expected to passively await its future. That, in itself, is dangerous.\" Parris's focus on that strand of Marr's book was perhaps a little perverse: the view from north of the border looked rather different. \"What does it mean to be British, he asks. The answer: not a lot,\" wrote James Robertson in Scotland on Sunday. \"Almost nothing to most Scots, nor, in fact, to the people hardest hit by the disintegration of the 'British' label, those for whom it has been a threadbare safety net against racism. Many who immigrated between the 50s and 70s, who came as a consequence of the historical fact of empire, now find that the identity they thought was theirs to put on has been discarded by others in favour of Scottish, Welsh and even English ones. \"The term 'British', it is now clear, was created and sustained for only one reason: the empire. Without the empire, it is redundant. Marr puts this into a wider context: the Americanisation of the world; the growth of Asian and Pacific economic power; the end of Communism and the new Europe. Identity is flexible now: all of us have become Europeans and Americans to some extent in the way we live our lives.\" Several reviewers mentioned that the book had evidently been written in a rush (Marr admitted as much in the introduction). \"This book, at first, feels deadeningly over-familiar,\" wrote Andy Beckett in the Guardian. \"Andrew Marr has produced - at speed - a volume heavily reliant on quotes from his fellow pundits and polemicists. Here are half-page sections and hurried references from Jeremy Paxman's The English, Peter Hitchens's The Abolition of Britain, Simon Heffer's Nor Shall My Sword: The Reinvention of England - all recent books, all concerned with the temperature of the nation in the early fevers of devolution, and all slightly patched together, short on original fact and thought.\" But Beckett quickly warmed to the book, especially when Marr took to the road and started to quote the opinions of anxious Brits. \"The Britain that emerges is mixed-up, complicated, and 'in a state of constant flux',\" concluded Beckett. \"The supposedly cruel capital, for example, absorbs immigrants more easily than allegedly friendlier regions. The English patriots of the Home Counties know more about Normandy than the north of England. The idea of Englishness itself, Marr suggests, may never, at any time, have meant the same thing to everyone. \"His writing relishes these tensions and contradictions: English tabloid culture is neatly summarised as 'swagger and self-pity'; the 'strange, sharp flavour' of modern Britain is crisply evoked. Marr concludes that only a federal country, with separate parliaments for each of its parts, can hope to hold such a hybrid together. He fears a complete break-up, interestingly, for the squeeze it might put on minorities.\" Meanwhile, Tom Nairn's After Britain: New Labour and the Return of Scotland (Granta, Â£15.99) got shorter shrift. A ponderous review by T M Devine in the Times found the book \"eloquent and sophisticated\" but had difficulty explaining why. \"We may indeed be seeing the first stages of a general reconfiguration of relationships within the British archipelago which, inter alia, disperses power from Westminster and by so doing maintains the political links between England and Scotland,\" wrote Devine. \"If London can respond positively and sympathetically to such a dynamic, the best bet for the future is probably a framework of federalism, rather than 'Scottish independence' in the classic form delineated in Tom Nairn's stimulating book.\" I think the publicists will just be satisfied with the word stimulating. Bernard Crick, in the Independent, was less well disposed to Nairn, dismissing his notion that the Scottish people felt the gaping wound of their lost state as \"romantic nonsense\". \"Nairn, amazingly, is an old-fashioned sovereignty man,\" Crick pointed out with a nice touch of irony. \"The British state is worn out, so therefore a Scottish state is needed.\" There was a more generous review in the Observer. \"Nairn is certainly a beast seen as fleetingly in these northern islands as the Arctic char or the wild cat - a genuine native intellectual... Nairn is in vintage form, shaking and sharp. He sees the coming English parliament clearly... This is, in short, the most intelligent book on the future of our states.\" So, take that Andrew Marr - you probably thought yours was the number one end-of-Britain tome. But who was the Observer reviewer who declared Nairn the winner on points? You have no doubt guessed: Andrew Marr himself.

The European campaign has to meet or refute nationalistic prejudices among the British - chiefly, among sections of the British press. It would do well to point out that nationalistic prejudice is a major part of the cancer destroying the Balkans. Nationalism is an evil. It causes wars, its roots lie in xenophobia and racism, it is a recent phenomenon - an invention of the last few centuries - which has been of immense service to demagogues and tyrants but to no-one else. Disguised as patriotism and love of one's country, it trades on the unreason of mass psychology to make a variety of horrors seem acceptable, even honourable. For example: if someone said to you, \"I am going to send your son to kill the boy next door\" you would hotly protest. But only let him seduce you with \"Queen and Country!\" \"The Fatherland!\" \"My country right or wrong!\" and you would find yourself permitting him to send all our sons to kill not just the sons of other people, but other people indiscriminately - which is what bombs and bullets do. Demagogues know what they are about when they preach nationalism. Hitler said, \"The effectiveness of the truly national leader consists in preventing his people from dividing their attention, and keeping it fixed on a common enemy.\" And he knew who to appeal to: Goethe had long since remarked that nationalistic feelings \"are at their strongest and most violent where there is the lowest degree of culture\". Nationalists take certain unexceptionable desires and muddle them with unacceptable ones. We individually wish to run our own affairs; that is unexceptionable. Most of us value the culture which shaped our development and gave us our sense of personal and group identity; that too is unexceptionable. But the nationalist persuades us that the existence of other groups and cultures somehow puts these things at risk, and that the only way to protect them is to see ourselves as members of a distinct collective, defined by ethnicity, geography, or sameness of language or religion, and to build a wall around ourselves to keep out \"foreigners\". It is not enough that the others are other; we have to see them as a threat - at the very least to \"our way of life\", perhaps to our jobs, even to our daughters. When Europe's overseas colonies sought independence, the only rhetoric to hand was that of nationalism. It had well served the unifiers of Italy and Germany in the 19th century (which in turn prepared the way for some of their activities in the 20th century), and we see a number of the ex-colonial nations going the same way today. The idea of nationalism turns on that of a \"nation\". The word is a joke: we British are one of the most mongrel of \"nations\", a mixture of so many immigrations in the last two millennia that the idea of a British ethnicity is comical, except for the Celtic fringes, whose boast has to be either that they remained so remote and disengaged, or so conquered, for the greater part of history, that they succeeded in keeping their gene pool \"pure\" (a cynic might say \"inbred\"). Much nonsense is talked about nations as entities: Emerson spoke of the \"genius\" of a nation as something separate from its numerical citizens; Giradoux described the \"spirit of a nation\" as \"the look in its eyes\". Nations are artificial constructs, their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars. And one should not confuse culture and nationality: there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity. The blindness of people who fall for nationalistic demagoguery is surprising. Those who oppose closer relations in Europe, or who seek to detach themselves from the larger comities to which they belong, need to understand the lesson of the Balkans, or - the same thing writ larger - Europe's tragic history in the last 100 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2000/feb/26/stevenpoole","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-26T01:09:48Z","webTitle":"The List","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/26/stevenpoole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/feb/26/stevenpoole","fields":{"headline":"The List","bodyText":"The Kingdom of Infinite Number Bryan Bunch Freeman, Â£13.95 Buy it at BOL Such has been the success of pop-maths books recently, it seems you need a new gimmick; only so many warm human stories can be wrapped around another exegesis of Fermat or probability. So Bunch has the fun idea of organising his book like a wildlife guide, describing numbers \"in their natural habitat\" as though we were leaf-decked twitchers in the Platonic realm. Each has \"field marks\" and, sweetly, a \"personality\" (some numbers, like 1 and 25, are \"friendly\"). Exploring numbers 1 to 20 explains many useful geometric and arithmetical ideas, before Bunch yomps on into more exotic fauna. Rotman's Even Bigger Biggest Number (10 to the power of 10 to the power of 98) is the highest number you could count to if you built a computer as big as the universe (so don't bother), and then we spot pi, the Imaginary Unit and various flavours of infinity, whereof Bunch likeably remarks: \"When I get to the infinity represented by the ordinal numbers, I always find that I go weak in the head.\" Uh, me too. How We Believe Michael Shermer Freeman, Â£14.95 Buy it at BOL Fifty years ago, it appeared to many onlookers that religion was on the wane and science was driving out superstition. Yet today 72% of Americans believe in angels. What went wrong? Shermer's excellent book takes on spiritualists (\"Talking Twaddle with the Dead\") and creationists; he has no hysterical Dawkinsian axe to grind, but he does rather diagnose theism as a weakness of the head. He finds, for example, that the single most popular justification of theism is an appeal to beauty or \"design\" in the wonderful complexity of the universe, but gently points out that such people are actually adducing empirical reasons - relying on senses rather than on faith. The \"evidence\", of course, is far better explained by evolution. Shermer, once a born-again Christian himself, understands God's warm, fuzzy comfort, and acknowledges that religion has been a very useful social institution. But now it's time to dump it in favour of a liberating wonder at cosmology and contingency.

For Democritus, colour and taste were mere conventions: \"In truth,\" he summed up, \"atoms and the void.\" Which may be trivially true, but doesn't get us anywhere. Stroud's highly readable and drily witty investigation of this hoary philosophical problem is both wide-ranging and amiably modest; indeed, he thinks there is probably no satisfying philosophical theory of \"reality\" to be had, ever.

And the strange thing is, it's believable. Not just because the land is so rich that it effortlessly bears the most delicious produce, but because it is just as fertile in fairytales and legend. After a few hours in Georgia's capital, with its strange curly writing, its 20ft statues of its celebrated poets, its neither eastern nor western sense of place where cars roll up the hills due to magnetic forces and where people generally live to over 100, anything seems possible. The Tbilisi wonderland was waiting for me as I fell out of the cafÃ© Dukani on to Rustaveli Avenue, scene of running battles and sniper fire in the 1992-94 civil war. The buildings showed a few signs of the conflict - pock- marked or in states of disrepair - otherwise, it was hard to believe this place could be anything other than the bustling, exciting European-style town that it is. I stopped in a church and was mesmerised by outbursts of achingly-beautiful close harmonies sung by what seemed to be a spontaneous choir. Then, sidetracked by the shop windows, I ducked into a delicatessen to discover tubs of caviar for only 10 Lari (Â£3.10). Tbilisi had got its claws into me, and I made for the flea market on the bank of the Mtkvari river, ready to part with more cash. There were strange objects and bargains: old Russian movie cameras, cooking implements, marvellous little treasures. Someone I mistook for a beggar offered me the sights from a sniper's rifle for 30 Lari (Â£9.35). \"You can use it at the football to see better,\" he said. There is a memory of war here. But there is something much stronger and as ancient as the conflicts this country has felt: its culture - and its performance culture in particular. I was told that every third Georgian is an actor, if not every one, and their lust for life is evident and infectious, as is their desire to tell a story over a drink - or drinks. Their theatrical culture is impossible to ignore. There is almost every kind of theatre space imaginable, including the One Person Theatre, which has room for an audience of 20, and the puppet theatre, which seats more than 100 and has a beautiful wooden interior - it was staging the story of the Battle of Stalingrad with puppets (if you can picture it). Even though I didn't understand a single word of Georgian, I decided to take in a show at the magnificent Rustaveli theatre. This proved to be a good move: it was true spectacle and showed how vibrant Georgia's live performance world is. The theatre was filled with a cross-section of society - the young, the fashion conscious, the old, families, young couples - all as a community laughing and cheering at a Commedia Dell'Arte show. Stuffed with culture but starving hungry, I wandered through the old quarter of town to find a place to eat. Seeing I was lost, a passer-by took me to a restaurant, sat me down, had a word with the patron and said he would join me later for a drink. Food arrived at my table. Drink as well. The music being played in the corner of the bar on a duduk - an ancient Armenian instrument, a bit like an oboe - was plaintive and mesmerising. My friend returned and told me the tune being played had been dedicated to me as the bar's guest. As we drank, he told me a bit about himself in broken English. He was a jeweller and, later, he insisted on taking me to his studio over the road - a tiny workshop where he turned out cameo jewellery. I asked him what material he used to make the delicate thumbnail-sized pieces. \"Marmot\", he replied. What? \"Mar-mot,\" he re-emphasised with more volume and stress on the second syllable. Seeing I was still puzzled, he produced a huge tusk from under his work bench and showed me a picture of a woolly mammoth. He was making cameo jewellery out of woolly mammoth tusks from Siberia. I guess they are not endangered species any more, but that had to be illegal, and when I asked him where he got it from, he said he bought it over the internet from a dealer in Moscow. The next day I met my Georgian friend, Mamuka, at the baths. He told me that these hot sulphur springs gave the city its name. \"Tbili\" means warm, he said and then related the story of how the fifth-century Georgian king Vakhtang Gorgasali had been hunting in the forest and speared a pheasant. On recovering his quarry, he found the bird in a pool of hot water, cooked and ready to eat, or was it that the bird fell in the water was healed and flew away. Anyway, he was so impressed, that he moved his palace to the spot and made it the centre of his kingdom. 'P ushkin also came to these baths and so did Dumas,\" said Mamuka. \"You've got to try it.\" Pushkin's personal bathroom had a huge stone pool brimming with hot spring water. I immersed myself, relaxed and drank tea. It was the best way to prepare for Mamuka's vodka onslaught. Over a bottle of Eduard Shevardnadze peace vodka (yes, politician-branded booze), Mamuka explained to me the complexities of Geor gian toasting. First you drink to peace, he said, then the reason for gathering. To the host, to parents and ancestors, to friends, to those who are no longer with us, to the people here - individually and combined. The list seemed to go on and on, and with each toast a shot of vodka. After such toasts and then a few more, gathering friends on the way, Mamuka led us through the falling snow and narrow winding streets crammed with houses with carved wooden verandas to a cellar restaurant. Snug inside, we sat and ate and drank still more. The people at the next table, who looked as if they had left their Kalashnikovs at the door, toasted us, our families and our friends and pulled up their chairs. It was infectious and intoxicating, but I really couldn't drink any more. I couldn't eat any more, either. And the table was creaking under the weight of food to be dreamed about. Spinach chopped and crushed with walnuts sprinkled with fleshy pomegranate seeds, lobio - a dish of beans cooked in an earthenware pot - stewed pork, mushrooms seasoned with garlic, oil and dill, khachapuri - a bready pastry folded over and stuffed with melted cheese - and much more besides. The vodka tasted like wine and the Georgian wine tasted like honey. But it only took a piece of tomato and a slice of cucumber to betray why this country was called the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. With no need for fertilisers, all the food is organic and even a staple salad tasted better than anything sun-ripened in the Mediterranean. Mamuka, with full Georgian hospitality, insisted on paying the bill. No argument. But I sneaked a look at it and was shocked. It was only 15 Lari (Â£4.70) a head. 5 best cafÃ©s 1 Dukani Next to the Kashveti Church, off Rustaveli Avenue.

In anyone's terminology, and most especially in Hollywood's, we are likely to be talking good looks.Thora Birch, and one of her young co-stars in American Beauty, Mena Suvari, certainly have 'talent'. Attention has focused on the hyper-real performances of Annette Bening, Kevin Spacey and Chris Cooper, but it is the adolescent characters played by Birch and Suvari which drive the plot. In the welter of award nominations fired at American Beauty it is surprising then that neither actress has picked up a mention As they enjoy their fame by association in the run-up to the Oscars next month, neither Birch nor Suvari should find it hard to show that their 'talent' comprises more than good looks. They may have spawned a thousand dodgy fan websites, but, first, they can both act, and, second, American Beauty tackles today's sexual obsession with youth in such a head-on way, taking it to the borders of paedophilia, that their roles as naive temptresses backfire on everyone around them, including the audience. The girls are the products of a high school casting machine that's been in overdrive in recent years. With all the campus screenplays which followed the success of Clueless (Election, 10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed and more), it has been hard for cinema-goers to spot the difference between a shooting star and a flash in the pan. Should we still be waiting for Alicia Silverstone to make a comeback? What about those TV crossovers, Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Michelle Geller? Are they anything more than cute? And, while we are on the subject of cute, what exactly did happen to Molly Ringwald and her Breakfast Club? The trouble is that young actors of either sex always suffer a little from the dog-on-its-hind-legs syndrome: children look clever if they can just say their lines in a sassy way but their precocity may not be so startling as they enter their mid-thirties. Jodie Foster is usually offered as the exception. She remains big at the box office, although she no longer has the pulling power to 'open' a movie. Other teen stars sometimes earn a second stab at stardom. Rob Lowe, for instance, has eventually clawed his way back via Wayne's World, TV and a moody descent into mayhem. So far Birch has made her name by effortlessly combining the bolshiness of Darleen's character in Roseanne with the spooky allure of Christina Ricci. In America she has also benefited, strangely, from a first name which is considered exotic. (They are not familiar with Thora Hird over there). Now 17, she grew up on a ranch in California where her parents named her after the god of thunder - and called her brother Bolt. She is a natural to play all those wayward, tomboy daughters who form the moral centre of many a current Hollywood screenplay. In this country we may not remember her early appearance as a blonde toddler in a Quaker Oats advertisement but many will have seen her as the beloved daughter of Harrison Ford and Anne Archer in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger in 1992 and 1994. Since then she has appeared with Ricci in Now And Then and won top billing in the adventure film Alaska in 1996. Birch is soon to start filming a screen version of the fantasy board game Dungeons and Dragons, starring as a princess opposite Jeremy Irons. Perhaps inspired by Foster, she hopes to end up on the other side of the camera as a director. While Birch gets to play all the bristling, wise-cracking children Suvari is definitely the baby doll type, the Lolita to end all Lolitas (let's hope). At 20 she is older than Birch and starred recently in American Pie. A natural redhead, her first name comes from an Egyptian godmother. Her father is an Estonian psychiatrist and her mother a nurse. Suvari has just finished making a black comedy, Sugar and Spice, where she will plays a cheerleader. Following the kitsch basketball 'ra-ra' scene in American Beauty, this means she is currently cornering the market in Aryan cheerleaders. Much of the credit for the wonky perspective on teenage life in American Beauty must go to another youngster, Wes Bentley, as Ricky Fitts, the boy who does not 'fit'. He sell drugs and secretly films his neighbours - yet this is our all-American hero . Bentley is 21 and comes from Arkansas. He is soon to be seen in Kingdom Come, an Americanised version of Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge , and he recently excelled in a small role in Jonathan Demme's Beloved. In American Beauty his distant blue eyes fetchingly match the stripe on his woolly hat and he is thoroughly unsettling. In fact Bentley inhabits the part of Ricky so completely that he is in danger of stopping his career. Casting directors may not spot how conventionally good looking he could be. No danger of that with Birch, who has taken to the celebrity circuit like a natural - well, she has been at the game for a while. At 14 she appeared on Conan O'Brien's celebrity chat show with a very short skirt and a ready wit. Talking about one of her earlier movies, Monkey Trouble, she admitted that one of the monkeys used in the film had to be taken off the set. 'The trainer said that one had a crush on me. It was, well, a guy monkey.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/feb/27/life1.lifemagazine1","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-27T23:57:51Z","webTitle":"Second opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/feb/27/life1.lifemagazine1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/feb/27/life1.lifemagazine1","fields":{"headline":"Second opinion","bodyText":"NO Professor Michael Radcliffe Lee, emeritus professor of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics at Edinburgh University The Irish Medicines Board has overreacted, and a 30,000 signature petition has been raised in Ireland to try to get them to reverse the decision, which came into effect in January. Use of St John's wort as an antidepressant has a long and distinguished history, but it really came to prominence in Germany during the 70s, and over the past 30 years Germans have used it successfully on many thousands of patients. They have much more clinical experience of it than anybody in the United States or in the United Kingdom. If you go and see a German doctor with mild to moderate depression, he will recommend a preparation of St John's wort, and only if that fails will he recommend a synthetic antidepressant. The reason is quite simple: the side-effects of chemical antidepressants - and they are there with all categories of drugs - cause adverse reactions in about 3 per cent of users. On average, 0.8 per cent of them have an adverse reaction to St John's wort. If I was depressed tomorrow, I would take it for a time, and only if that failed would I then move on to a synthetic antidepressant, such as Prozac. YES Professor Tony Moffat, chief scientist at the Pharmaceutical Society I think that St John's wort is too freely available because it comes without advice to the general public. I don't necessarily think that it should only be available on prescription, though. The answer for products such as St John's wort is, I think, a sort of third-way licensing arrangement that guarantees that what you're buying is safe, of good quality and comes with genuine warnings on the packaging. Information needs to be available to the patient. At the moment, for example, warnings about interaction with other drugs and contraindications are not being provided. I would at least like to see St John's wort only being sold by trained health-care professionals such as pharmacists, so that anyone who wants advice can get it immediately, as opposed to their just picking it off the shelf at a supermarket because they read about it in a magazine. I actually think that if you're depressed, you should go to your GP in the first instance; you need medical advice from a doctor. There's always a danger that people will take St John's wort for long periods of time, when if they'd gone to see a doctor, they might have been prescribed something that worked more quickly.

Despite attempts by groups such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Campaign for Freedom of Information to find out what goes on behind closed doors at Sellafield, the nationalised company has always pleaded commercial secrecy to avoid telling the public what happens there. The Health and Safety Commission, which is supposed to protect the public, has been happy to go along with this code of silence. Ironically it has taken the non-nuclear Japanese government to expose this particular scandal by proving that BNFL falsified plutonium fuel safety data on nuclear fuel exported there. Faced with proof of \"systematic management failures\" in a report from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and with a Â£12bn order book for reprocessed fuel from the Thorp plant at risk, the chief executive was, for once, left with little choice. The news could not be worse for chancellor Gordon Brown and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers, who are hoping to float off part of BNFL to raise money for future tax cuts. No one is going to be very interested in the sale if the company's commercial future is not bright. It has been difficult enough to sell the reprocessed fuel - known as mox - without all this flaring up. For workers in one of the more depressed part of the United Kingdom this is bad news indeed. With high unemployment around Workington, Whitehaven and along the coast to Barrow in Furness, Sellafield is a major employer and provides some of best paid, most hi-tech jobs available. The workers can probably rely on former cabinet minister Jack Cunningham, the MP for Copeland, to take up their cause. A staunch supporter of the chemical and nuclear industries, Mr Cunningham is likely to use his close links with the government to press for action. Some support can also be expected from other Labour MPs in the area, notably the social services minister, John Hutton, who represents Barrow, and Dale Campbell Savours, Labour MP for Workington. The latter, however, is well known for his \"zero tolerance\" over cover ups - whether in MI5 or among colleagues who fail to declare their business interests to parliament - so he will need convincing. In the meantime Mr Byers will seek to restore public confidence by proving that he can act tough. More heads could roll before the week is out in a desperate attempt to show the company is back on track.

Kim Tan, 44, is founder and managing director of KS Biomedix, a Surrey company that has come up with a way of using antibodies from sheep to fight cancer. Until recently, KS toiled at the obscure end of the drug development sector. However, since November it has emerged as a hot favourite in the rush for hi-tech shares. Its market value has jumped from Â£160m to Â£360m and Dr Tan owns a hefty 60%. He also chairs an Ofex-listed firm, Gene Medix, where his shares are worth more than Â£150m, making him one of the richest entrepreneurs in the industry. Dr Tan insists he has amassed his fortune almost by accident - he went into business after becoming frustrated with studying for a series of post-doctoral qualifications at Surrey university: \"I decided I wasn't good enough to do first division science so I thought I'd try my hand at running a business.\" His first venture was a diagnostics company, Guildhay, which he sold for around Â£500,000. He used this, together with a Â£250,000 grant from the department of trade, to set up KS Biomedix. The company capitalised on his research into pancreatic cancer. His team first tried attacking tumours by injecting cancer antigens - which stimulate the production of antibodies - into mice and capturing the immune antibodies produced by the animals. However, mouse antibodies were not powerful enough, so Dr Tan decided to try sheep. That was successful almost immediately. KS now has its own flock of sheep which produce a regular supply of antibodies. Analysts believe that by licensing these on to other drug development firms the company could be making profits of Â£100m within 10 years. Dr Tan says: \"It will be business to business. We've no ambition to be in drugs sales ourselves - there are plenty of good, good companies out there who can distribute our drugs to doctors.\" From the start KS had a frugal culture. Despite his paper wealth, Dr Tan is on a salary of Â£70,000 and, like his fellow directors, has no company car or corporate pension scheme. He says: \"When we came to the market, the model for drug development companies really was British Biotech - expansive offices, expensive sales forces and all the rest of it. \"We set our stall out, saying we believe that when we raise funds we want to use the money to fund science rather than directors' lifestyles.\" His lifestyle is modest - he still drives an eight-year-old Volkswagen Golf. In its first five years on the market, KS raised just Â£10m. Then yesterday the company placed another 2.27m shares to boost its bank balance by Â£15.4m. The company employs just 20 people, with offices in Guildford and laboratories in Farnborough. Much of its development work is contracted out to third parties. Dr Tan has business in his blood - his father runs a food wholesale business distributing rice and sugar throughout Malaysia. \"My father came to Malaysia [from China] aged 18 with nothing. He built up his own business and supported my whole family.\" Dr Tan now sends money back to help his nine siblings: \"It's a very Asian thing - you feel responsible for supporting each other.\" A committed Christian, he is also involved in a number of charities in the developing world, including the Tear Fund, an evangelical relief organisation. \"I have a Christian faith and my background biases me towards the developing world,\" he says. The only hitch so far has been an embarrassing incident two years ago when KS recruited a senior manager who failed to disclose a rape conviction. The press found out and Dr Tan, who was obliged to sack him, felt bruised by the whole affair. Colleagues say this turned him against the media. KS yesterday said its half-year losses had increased from Â£536,000 to Â£925,000 before tax, due to the cost of clinical trials of two arthritis drugs. Both are likely to enter phase three clinical trials this year, and a partnering deal with a big pharmaceuticals company should get milestone payments rolling in, pushing KS into the black. Dr Tan insists: \"We don't have big egos at this company. A number of biotech companies have been run by cult figures, and I don't think that's good for the long term.\" However, he heads a list of biotech entrepreneurs who have suddenly found themselves sitting on a fortune. For example, Galen Holdings' chairman Allen McClay has shares worth Â£200m and Powderject's Paul Drayson has a stake worth Â£40m. Despite their low profiles, the biotech millionaires are beginning to rival Britain's much-hyped \"dot.com\" entrepreneurs. The race is on to be the drugs world's Bill Gates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/feb/29/sarahhall","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-02-29T01:48:25Z","webTitle":"17 dogs and a cat ride into history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/29/sarahhall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/feb/29/sarahhall","fields":{"headline":"17 dogs and a cat ride into history","bodyText":"Digby, a two-year-old Polish lowland shepherd dog, is clearly in an uncertain mood as he waits at Calais to become one of the first dogs to enter Britain for almost a century without undergoing quarantine. \"Don't worry,\" smiles Carolyn Menteith fixedly, as she stuffs him with biscuits to mollify him. He drools; the smile becomes more rigid. \"He's just a little over-excited.\" But if Digby is salivating, it is as nothing compared to the reaction of the posse of dog lovers who have campaigned for some six years for this moment: the introduction of pet passports and the relaxation of Britain's strict quarantine rules. As they wait to board the first pet train - a Eurotunnel Shuttle carrying 17 dogs and one cat - there is an almost-tangible sense of triumphalism among the campaigners, for whom the Â£200 cost and lengthy bureaucratic process involved in proving their animals are rabies-free has been well worth it. \"This is a historic day,\" cries Lady Fretwell, the formidable force behind the pressure group Passports for Pets, as she hugs the pet-loving Tory MP Roger Gale and Dennis, her daughter's chocolate labrador. \"I just say: Thank God the United Kingdom has moved with modern science and we now have a system worthy of our country.\" And how will she be celebrating? \"I shouldn't really say this,\" she confides from beneath her Passports for Pets baseball cap. \"But I was pissed once when I was 21 and I should think I might be again tonight.\" For Lady Fretwell, a former ambassador's wife who formed the group after her bassett hound Bertie died six months after quarantine, yesterday's change in the rules will mean she can take his replacement, Claude, to the family's house in Normandy. But for many of her supporters the effect will be more profound. Bill Whitehouse, a 31-year-old telecoms manager, will be able to end a peripatetic European lifestyle - prompted by his refusal to put Ximo, a five-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback he bought while working in Majorca, into quarantine - and join his wife Lynn and 18-month-old daughter Holly, at home in Solihull Corporal Colin Binge, of the Queen's Royal Hussars, and his wife Nicola, were yesterday able to move from their home in Germany to Tidworth, Hampshire, without leaving behind their 13-year-old munsterlander, Ivan. But perhaps the greatest benefit will be felt by the likes of Professor Rodney Harris, a retired and profoundly deaf medical geneticist who yesterday made the historic crossing with his 10-year-old hearing dog Jodie. He has previously felt very isolated on his trips to Europe where he lectures regularly. \"When I stay in hotels she's my ear for things like the alarm clock, telephone and fire alarm. Besides, she's normally with me 24 hours a day - and it's a real wrench to be separated from her.\" The pet travel scheme - currently being piloted by the Shuttle and five ferry companies - is cumbersome at present, involving each pet being fitted with an identification microchip, vaccinated against rabies and blood-tested before being issued with a \"passport\". Six months later, they can travel but must be treated by a vet for ticks and worms before they enter the UK. \"This is a momentous occasion,\" proclaimed Lady Fret-well, as the dogs arrived on British soil. \"To me, it's a miracle. My dog is getting in the car and coming home with me - and that's as it should be.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/mar/01/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-01T01:31:06Z","webTitle":"Search for the Star Dust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/01/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/mar/01/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Search for the Star Dust","bodyText":"In 1947 my uncle disappeared in Argentina. His plane vanished in the Andes on a flight between Buenos Aires and Santiago. In January this year, after 53 years, wreckage from the plane was found by climbers on mount Tupungato, a peak of 21,850ft. Last week, soldiers from the 11th Argentine Mountain Regiment set up base camp at Tres Quebradas (Three Ravines) and, leaving the mules and journalists, continued to climb the bleak, volcanic mountain. The landscape, even in summer, is dusted with snow and in deep, permanent shadow. Using the last days of clear weather before winter sets in, the soldiers climbed another 7,000ft to the frozen wreckage. It is an arduous and dangerous climb, and two of them are now in hospital. But they succeeded in recovering an oxygen cylinder, parts of the propellers, scraps of clothing, an empty wallet. Below the peak, the melting glacier has yielded one of the plane's wheels, tyre still inflated. The expedition has also rescued three bodies, preserved in the permanent frost, and part of a fourth. They may have finally solved the mystery of the plane's disappearance. On August 4 1947, the Times reported: \"A British South American Airways four-engined Lancastrian, the Star Dust . . . is reported missing and is believed to have made a forced landing in the Andes mountains. Six passengers are stated to be on board.\" One of these was my uncle, Peter Young, who had boarded in Buenos Aires. The report continues: \"Contact with the aircraft was lost at 9 o'clock last night, and it was due to arrive at Santiago at 1 o'clock this morning.\" The plane had come from London, with its crew of four ex-RAF bomber pilots, and the \"star girl\" stewardess. It was a flight that then took three days, six hours and 10 minutes. There were three possible routes to take to Santiago de Chile, all of them hazardous. It is not a great distance across the Andes, but in the way stand Aconcagua, the highest peak in South America (23,000ft), and the volcanic mount Tupungato. As the weather deteriorated, the pilot made an unscheduled stop in the pretty mountain resort of Mendoza. He decided to take the most direct route, but there was a risk of severe icing. A Chilean Air Force operator received a Morse code message - STENDEC - which was repeated, but has never been deciphered. And then the Star Dust disappeared. In the 1970s, generals such as Pinochet in Chile and Videla in Argentina made South America a continent famous for its Disappeared. The generals succeeded in altering the English language, and adding a new passive tense to an English verb that was once exclusively active. There have been two theories that the Star Dust was \"disappeared\". One involves a conspiracy by Peronistas to destroy official British government papers on board; the other, sabotage by people determined that the new airline BSAA should not succeed. It is more likely that the wings were iced. Two days after the first reports, there is a chilly announcement by the postmaster-general in the Times of August 6, that \"air mail correspond-ence for Chile posted in the United Kingdom on July 29 was on board the aircraft Star Dust, which is overdue on its flight from Buenos Aires to Santiago\". In October a search party from Santiago found a different plane. The search continued without success. In March 1948 the stationery office issued a report (price 9d) concluding that \"the actual cause of the accident remains obscure\". The foreign office issued a statement that \"the cause of the disaster may never be known, and in the light of former accidents in the Andes, the aircraft may not be found for years, if ever\". I remember that the news of Peter's disappearance came in August, for I was outside, stamping on tar bubbles. The family heard the news over the wireless, giving Peter's name. My aunt fainted. My grandmother never believed it. Because the first reports spoke of \"a forced landing\", she never gave up hope that, somewhere in the inaccessible Andean peaks he was alive, and would be rescued. There's a photograph of uncle Peter in Buenos Aires, in a dashing white South American suit and correspondent shoes. And a pile of post cards, saved by my grandmother. The first card is from Romania, where he tutored the young Prince Michael. I think he got the job, after Oxford, because his enterprising uncle John had tutored the family of the Prince of Tek, and had once stood Queen Mary in a corner. Not many people got the better of her. I don't know why he went on to South America. The postcards come thick and fast from Cuernavaca, Lima, Santiago and Rio de Janeiro. There's a postcard showing one of the monster-gods of the Aztecs, a huge stone gargoyle baying for sacrificial human blood. \"It proves,\" Peter writes, \"that the Mexicans like a joke.\" He travelled across South America constantly. A month or two after the outbreak of the second world war, he writes from Lima: \"This is where I have been staying during the past two weeks, out in the country. In two days' time I leave for Chile and at the end of the month go to Buenos Aires, where I look forward to finding some letters from you.\" Newly married, he writes from Buenos Aires: \"We arrived back from Chile after a three-day journey across the Andes,\" and he hopes that the family \"are not being much worried by raids, and have enough food.\" There was a shortage of glamour in the England of 1946. With my brother I had come from a colour-filled childhood in India to the dark and grime of post-war England. At Christmas we stayed with my grandmother, briefly released from boarding schools of Dickensian horror. That Christmas, Peter arrived from Argentina with a concertina, a collapsible opera hat and a glamorous wife in fox furs and high heels. She smelled wonderful. My cousins Caroline and Ruth and I - we were seven and six and four - still remember that Christmas vividly. Peter brought us chocolate in silver paper, and dolls with open-and-shut eyes that had real lashes. The war-dark house sparkled, and as they put on their 78s and danced the tango, it was better than Fred and Ginger. Near my grandmother's house there was a Doctor Barnardo's, where I made friends with a girl called Sylvia - I think I too felt like an orphan. We were inseparable, and since neither of us had ever been to the theatre, Peter took us both to Cinderella. It was the first time I can remember laughing in England. I even remember the joke. The Ugly Sisters decided they must slim for the Prince's Ball. They waddled in to a \"slimming chamber\" trailing a real dachshund on a lead behind them. They emerged, slender in fishnet tights, trailing a string of sausages. We were shocked for a moment, but Peter said he could hear the dog barking in the wings, so we knew it was all right. Sylvia and I fell off our seats, helpless with laughter. The usherette was bootfaced, and threatened to throw us out. But Peter charmed her, and told her we were orphans, and dusted us down. He was always generous. He gave my parents Â£100 for their wedding present - truly a fortune - and with it they bought a Ford 8, in which my mother ferried wounded troops recuperating in Poonah. It lasted until 1943, when spare parts could no longer be found in India. In the 60s, long after his disappearance, my cousins and I each received Â£500, the kind of money that can make all the difference to your life. Only once was there a chance that his body might be found. In 1970 I was in Santiago, interviewing Salvador Allende for this paper, when there came a report that an Andean glacier had melted, and moved, and that an aircraft fuselage had been glimpsed on the inaccessible reaches of mount Tupungato. I felt I owed it to my uncle to finish his story, but by the time I reached Argentina the wreckage had once more vanished under the Andean snows. And now at last, some at least of the bodies have been found. I hope that DNA tests don't mean the bones and bodies will now be separated. I feel that all 11 of the dead, English, Palestinian, German, should be buried and commemorated, as they died, together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/mar/01/uksecurity","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-01T01:31:34Z","webTitle":"Terrorism act raid on bookshop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/01/uksecurity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/mar/01/uksecurity","fields":{"headline":"Terrorism act raid on bookshop","bodyText":"A man was being questioned last night following raids by West Midlands police and MI5 officers on two houses and a bookshop in Birmingham.

A spokesman said the warrants were issued in connection with \"links to terrorist offences which have been committed outside the United Kingdom. One person was arrested in connection with firearms offences and the investigations are on-going\". Police refused to give any further details, but the Maktabah al Ansaar bookshop in Sparkbrook was the subject of one raid. It sells books such as The Virtues of Jihad, Declaration of War, and Dissent of the Muslim Lands. Several cars in the area were also searched.

But if this medical centre on the Red Sea coast is the physical embodiment of earlier boom times, it also represents the slumps that have periodically hit the world's largest oil exporter during the later 1980s and through the 1990s. Doctors at the hospital complain that parts of this fancy edifice became, in reality, an empty shell because operating revenues fell off as lavish state funding faded in recent years. A dialysis unit, bought with money donated by a member of the ruling family, \"stopped working because there isn't enough money to keep it going\", a Saudi doctor said. \"When we sit with administrators and come up with plans and requests they say, 'How can we do all of this? We don't have the money for it'.\" But after a surge year for oil prices, everybody is hoping that the good old days are about to return, the days when the kingdom was flush with oil cash, and the hospital's corridors were bustling with nurses and technicians from the west. When oil prices tumbled, the western expatriates, along with their high salaries and other benefits, were replaced by cheaper expertise from the Indian subcontinent, east Asia and neighbouring Arab countries. The government began threatening to replace expatriate workers - who make up a third of the country's population of 18m - with Saudis. Now a huge sigh of relief can be heard as oil prices climb to their highest levels in almost 10 years, and no wonder: Saudi Arabia depends on oil for at least 70% of its revenues. \"A year ago, people were thoroughly miserable,\" said a western diplomat in the capital, Riyadh. \"This started to change in September. We hear from everyone we speak to in the business community that people are much more confident than a year ago.\" The past year's rise in oil prices has yet to work its way through to produce an economic turn-round. \"There's always a time lag,\" the diplomat said, \"but we're seeing the beginning of the curve of increase in economic activity.\" Construction, he argued, was a key indicator. \"Although there aren't any major projects, contacts say a lot of projects are about to leave the drawing board and we expect things to pick up.\" This is music to the ears of a country that has not proved very good at adapting to budget deficits and the prospect of an end to cradle-to-grave state services. In 1998 oil prices hit their lowest point in 12 years. The 1990-91 Gulf war had already cost the Saudis an estimated $55bn (Â£35bn at current rates) and periods of recession in the west and Asia made demand weak for the abundant supply of petroleum flowing at the time. Every time a barrel of oil drops by $1, it is said to cost Saudi Arabia about $2.5bn in annual revenue. But following Opec's decision in March last year to restrict oil supplies, the months of rising prices led the Saudi British Bank to predict in December that Saudi Arabia's budget for 2000 would project a deficit of about $3bn, sharply lower than the $12bn foreseen for the 1999 budget. It said: \"Government expenditure is still fairly tight despite oil prices that are up on last year. The focus is on things like health, education and housing projects. It is not on defence or on infrastructure.\" A report last month by the Saudi American Bank predicted big economic changes this year if, as expected, Saudi Arabia is admitted to the World Trade Organisation. It foresaw a greater opening to foreign investment and con tinuing attempts at domestic reforms. Higher oil revenues might have helped the economy in 1999, said the Saudi American Bank, but the government still had other issues to tackle - including high state debt, low capital spending on infrastructure and growing unemployment. It called youth unemployment an \"emerging problem\", saying that 15%-20% of Saudis aged 20-29 were jobless. Even during the years of plunging oil prices, no one said Saudi Arabia had become poor. From swanky cars to designer labels, the evidence of oil riches remains abundant. Although oil prices are picking up, no one is expecting a 1970s-style bonanza. Crown Prince Abdullah told Gulf leaders last year to accept the reality: \"The oil boom is finished,\" he said, \"so get over it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2000/mar/02/technology1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-02T02:17:23Z","webTitle":"Not such suckers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/mar/02/technology1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2000/mar/02/technology1","fields":{"headline":"Not such suckers","bodyText":"The traditional image of the animal kingdom is a pyramid. At the bottom are the single-celled creatures, higher up are slugs and shellfish, then fish, amphibians and reptiles up to mammals at the top. Scientists are less dogmatic about higher and lower lifeforms these days. But when an Italian scientist announced that octopuses showed learning abilities comparable to mammals a controversy erupted. Graziano Fiorito's experiment involved two octopuses separated by a glass barrier. (Apparently researchers do not use the term \"octopi\".) The octopus on one side was trained to ignore a white ball and strike at a red one to get a reward. But the second octopus appeared to learn just by watching the first one. This is known as observational learning, and it was thought to be an ability unique to \"higher\" life-forms. Octopuses are superbly adapted to their environment. In a case of parallel evolution they have eyes that are very similar to those of vertebrates. Their eyes are better in some ways: they have no blind spot, and can detect the polarisation of light as well as colour and brightness. The skin of the octopus is covered in chromatophores, sophisticated organs for changing colour. An octopus can camouflage itself in a fraction of a second. While swimming through weed, it can even produce a pattern matching the weeds that ripples backwards through its body to negate the impression of movement. Being well adapted is not the same as being intelligent, and octopus are classed as molluscs, along with shellfish and slugs. The critics quickly found flaws in Fiorito's experiment. In particular they warned of the Clever Hans effect. The original Clever Hans was a marvellous horse who performed in Germany at the turn of the century. He could tap out the answer to mathematical questions with his hoof, or use coded taps to spell out answers to other questions. A board of scientists examined the horse to find out if he was a fraud. They suspected that the owner was giving signals somehow, but when they excluded him Hans proved almost as clever as before. The scientists were baffled until one called Oskar Pfungst realised that the horse could reply correctly only when someone present knew the answer. Hans was picking up subtle, unconscious cues from his questioners. He tapped until he noticed the tell-tale signs (an exhalation of breath or a relaxation of shoulders) that he had reached the right answer. He was a remarkable horse, but not in the way his owner thought. As well as problems of cueing from the researchers, Fiorito's experiment failed to take into account the fact that even untrained octopuses will strike at a red ball three times as often as a white one. The critics won, and octopuses were again relegated to the status of mindless rubbery creatures. Fiorito designed new experiments. He showed that an octopus could be trained to get at a crab in a jar by unscrewing the top. An octopus that had seen this trick done learned how to do it more quickly than one which had not seen the demonstration by its fellow. The critics pointed out that this could be a case of release behaviour, where an animal's innate instinct lies dormant until triggered by some external factor. Other experiments showed that an octopus which has seen or even scented a crab learns how to catch them more quickly than one which has not. Simply having the observer octopus see a crab could be enough to speed its learning. Fiorito set out to improve his original experiment. He alternated with using red and white balls as the target to cancel out any bias. The experimenters were carefully screened from the octopuses to prevent cueing. The results matched his original findings. Although the debate continues, it is now widely accepted that octopuses are capable of observational learning. Jennifer Mather was working at the university of Lethbridge in Alberta where the octopuses were the only creatures in the aquarium to be given individual names by volunteers. She devised a personality test for octopuses, measuring their reactions to different stimuli and found that each of her subjects responded differently in ways that remained consistent over time. In other words, each octopus was an individual with its own personality. Mather put a floating bottle in the aquarium to see if the octopuses would play with it. After exploring it with tentacles and beak, most ignored it. But two of the octopuses started squirting at the bottle with jets of water, making it circle the tank. \"All instances (of play) continued over 10 minutes, the longest was 23. If a human was doing this, someone would say we were bouncing a ball.\" Play was previously thought to be confined to birds and mammals. Other areas of octopus life remain unresearched. There are reports that octopuses will use a stone to prevent a mussel shell from closing. Is this an instinctive act, like Darwin's tool-using finches, or is it learned behaviour? We also know that octopuses communicate with each other with rippling displays of colour. Are they simple repetitive calls like birdsong, or is it something more complex? The common octopus tested by Fiorito weighs only a few pounds and lives about three years. Around 150 new species have been discovered in the last 10 years. In the ocean depths are octopuses with light-generating organs instead of colour-changing ones; nothing is known of their behaviour. Some of the creatures down there might bear the same relation to the common octopus as we do to mice and rats. If there are intelligent octopuses, experience shows they will find that proving their intelligence to human scientists is quite a challenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/mar/02/stansted.theairlineindustry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-02T02:17:46Z","webTitle":"Return ticket to Kabul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/02/stansted.theairlineindustry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/mar/02/stansted.theairlineindustry","fields":{"headline":"Return ticket to Kabul","bodyText":"For the thousands of asylum applicants who have waited for many months, some for years, for a decision on their refugee status, Jack Straw's decision yesterday on the Afghanis who arrived at Stansted last month must seem extraordinary. Within mere weeks a giant investigation has apparently been carried out and some 29 applicants for refugee status have had their replies from the United Kingdom government. True, their circumstances were exceptional - carried here on a hijacked airliner. True, the home secretary has been under intense pressure to signal to the world that this country is no \"soft touch\" and cannot - no civilised country could - allow gunmen a quick route to safe haven. But the speed and scale of his decision still leave an impression of a minister bending in the face of a media and opinion pollsters' gale. If (as reported) the Blair government thinks it about time it rounded on the moulders of public and political opinion in the rightwing press, here would have been an excellent place to have started. Yesterday Mr Straw indicated his officials had closely studied the individual dossiers. The hijackers, 14 in number, face criminal charges. A number of the 44 who are claiming asylum (who have some 33 dependents) are still being investigated. He definitively rejected the claims of 27 applicants - they have been judged to face no threat of persecution on returning to Afghanistan. A cynic might wonder if the positive decision in favour of two applicants (and their dependents) has useful cosmetic properties, as the sign of a home secretary's compassion and mastery of the details. Without retracing the steps in his reasoning in all the cases, that is hard to judge. Does Jack Straw deserve the benefit of the doubt? Remember how he pre-judged this decision in his Commons statement at the end of the hijack: he bluntly wondered aloud whether any of the hostages would be eligible for asylum because the plane had been hijacked on an internal flight. Pressure is reported to have been applied to the hostages by immigration officers. Initially only 17 of them were said to be ready to return to Afghanistan. By the time the return flight had been organised, 73 took places. Lawyers have been concerned that not all the hostages had legal representatives present in their initial interviews. Although not illegal, this is neither fair nor good practice. The International Office of Migration, an independent body, noted the hostages were \"tired and quite confused\" at the time of the interviews. No one should forget what is happening in Afghanistan under its brutal Taliban regime. About 4,000 Afghan people applied to the UK for asylum last year with 800 of the first 805 being accepted. This is hardly surprising when even the normally hardline home office, in its review of political conditions there, set out a catalogue of public executions, public amputations by doctors (hands and feet of thieves), and public floggings of up to 100 lashes on women as well as men, to audiences of up to 30,000 people in Kabul's national stadium. Mr Straw has precedents to note in dealing with the consequences of hijacking. In 1982 and in 1996 the Tories were persuaded that hijackers should eventually be allowed to stay. So his mettle will be shown in the asylum decisions still outstanding - and how much effort the government puts into ensuring that those who have been rejected are indeed safe. The handling of these cases is a grim responsibility for the home secretary. We have to hope that Jack Straw's optimism about the fate of those going home will turn out to have been justified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/mar/03/pinochet.chile8","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-03T02:24:23Z","webTitle":"Straw tells why charges were not possible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/03/pinochet.chile8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/mar/03/pinochet.chile8","fields":{"headline":"Straw tells why charges were not possible","bodyText":"Edited text of Jack Straw's statement to MPs My role under the extradition act 1989 is a quasi-judicial one. Although neither are generally incorporated into our domestic law, both the European extradition convention and the United Nations torture convention place important obligations on the UK, but I have to discharge those obligations within the powers and responsibilities placed on me by UK law. All the decisions which I have taken have been mine alone, and have not been decisions of her majesty's government. Throughout, I have been keenly aware of the gravity of the crimes allegedly committed by Senator Pinochet, and of the desire for justice by those who suffered at the hands of the former Chilean regime. This has been an unprecedented case. Both I and the courts have had to navigate in uncharted territory. Two judicial committees of the House of Lords took different views about what offences constituted extradition crimes. More recently, Mr Justice Kay ruled that my refusal of Belgium's request for disclosure of the medical report which I had commissioned was correct: shortly afterwards a full divisional court, while acknowledging strong arguments on both sides, came to the opposite view. Senator Pinochet landed at Heathrow airport on 22 September 1998, for a private visit to the United Kingdom. On 16 October the Metropolitan police received an extradition request from a Madrid court for the provisional arrest of Senator Pinochet for serious offences including the murder of Spanish citizens. The police were advised by FCO officials that Senator Pinochet did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from arrest. The Bow Street magistrates court then issued a provisional arrest warrant and Senator Pinochet was arrested that evening. Senator Pinochet's solicitors made representations to me on 21 October 1998, asking me to cancel this provisional arrest warrant. I declined to do so on the basis that the issues raised at this stage were a matter for the court. They challenged my decision. A divisional court, headed by the lord chief justice, rejected that challenge and awarded me my costs. The court nevertheless quashed the warrant on the grounds that Senator Pinochet had sovereign immunity as a former head of state and that the warrant did not disclose an extradition crime. The crown prosecution service, acting on behalf of Spain, then entered an appeal to the House of Lords. In a unique feature of this case, the issue was considered twice by the House of Lords, first in November 1998 and then, after the first judgment was vacated, in March 1999. The key majority finding of the second court was that torture was an international crime over which the parties to the torture convention had universal jurisdiction and that a former head of state did not have immunity from such crimes. This ruling was a landmark judgment in human rights law, whose impact has been felt far beyond our shores. It will be a permanent legacy of the Pinochet case. I issued a second authority to proceed on 14 April 1999. A second judicial challenge by Senator Pinochet's representatives was again rejected by the divisional court. On 8 October 1999 Senator Pinochet was committed by the Bow Street magistrate to await my decision whether or not to extradite him to Spain. Senator Pinochet's solicitors applied for habeas corpus and a hearing date was set for 20 March this year. On 14 October, I received representations from the Chilean embassy, supported by medical reports, which suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in Senator Pinochet's health. I commissioned a medical examination of Senator Pinochet. The report indicated that Senator Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and that no significant improvement could be expected. I informed the interested parties on 11 January that in the light of this medical evidence and subject to any representations received by 18 January, I was minded to conclude that no purpose would be served by continuing the Spanish extradition request. On 25 January a judicial review application was made by Belgium and Amnesty International for disclosure of the medical report. A judgment of 15 February said that I should disclose the report to Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland only in terms of strict confidence. Requesting states were invited to make any representation on the medical report by Tuesday 22 February 2000. I considered the matter afresh in the light of all this material. Having done so, I was satisfied that the conclusion of the original report was correct. The principle that an accused person should be mentally capable of following the proceedings, instructing lawyers and giving coherent evidence is fundamental to the idea of a fair trial. The trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet, on the charges which have been made against him in this case, could not be fair in any country, and would violate article 6 of the European convention on human rights. A number of representations which I received argued that even if there were questions about Senator Pinochet's fitness for trial, these should be determined in Spain and not here. I looked at this question with great care. However, I was advised and I concluded that on the basis of English law I was bound to form a view of my own on Senator Pinochet's fitness to stand trial and that I could not refrain from reaching such a view on the basis that the question could be determined in Spain. In any event, I established with the assistance of the Spanish authorities that their principles for determining the fitness of an accused to stand trial were similar to ours. I therefore concluded that given the advice that no improvement in Senator Pinochet's condition could be expected, no judicial purpose would have been served by the continuation of extradition proceedings for the objective of a trial in Spain which could not result in any verdict on the charges against him. Of the 70,000 letters and emails from the public which I have received from all over the world, and many letters from members of parliament and organisations, almost all have urged me to allow the extradition proceedings to take their course, so that the allegations made against Senator Pinochet could be tried. I attach great importance to the principle that universal jurisdiction against persons charged with international crimes should be effective. I am all too aware that the practical consequence of refusing to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain is that he will probably not be tried anywhere. I am very conscious of the sense of injury which will be felt by those who suffered from breaches of human rights in Chile in the past, as well as their relatives. All of these are matters of great concern, and I had them very much in mind when considering the evidence about Senator Pinochet's state of health. They are among the reasons why I required the evidence of Senator Pinochet's condition to satisfy a high standard of expertise, thoroughness, objectivity and cogency before I was prepared to act on it. Ultimately, however, I was driven to the conclusion that a trial of the charges against Senator Pinochet, however desirable, was simply no longer possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/mar/03/fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-03T15:09:00Z","webTitle":"The old ultra-violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/03/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/mar/03/fiction","fields":{"headline":"The old ultra-violence","bodyText":"\"Why did they ban Chocolate Orange?\" Ali G's stern question last year to James Ferman, the former British film censor, epitomises the alienated, semi-informed bemusement of an entire generation. In 1973, the late Stanley Kubrick instructed Warner Bros to withdraw from UK distribution his extraordinary, flawed masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, based on the Anthony Burgess novel. That remarkable act of selective self-suppression has meant that almost no one under the age of 44 has seen it in this country. And now, for the first time in 27 years, A Clockwork Orange is back on British cinema screens. We can all see for ourselves what the fuss has been about. For decades, Kubrick's explicit and brilliantly scabrous fable of \"ultra-violence\" has existed only as a fascinating rumour. It has been a spectral, residual influence here, surfacing in strange, analogous forms. From the Sex Pistols, Bowie and Julien Temple to the Gooners and the Inter-City Firm, the film has persisted in making its shadowy inscriptions on our collective unconscious. Kubrick's diktat was taken very seriously by Warner Bros - what modern commercial auteur could hope now for that level of unquestioning corporate support? - and policed so vigorously that no video copies could legitimately be sold or viewed here; a screening at the (now defunct) Scala cinema in north London in 1993 led to prosecution. For years, British fans of Kubrick were forced to watch A Clockwork Orange on grainy, exhausted prints at fleapit cinemas in Paris, Amsterdam and New York. It is only quite recently, with the growth of global internet retail, and the availability of a new generation of \"multi-regional\" DVD player, that we have been able to import the American DVD edition from amazon.com, albeit at the risk of confiscation by customs and excise. As of next Friday, all this will recede into the legendary past. With it will go the strange dual reality for A Clockwork Orange: it has never been a \"lost\" or samizdat movie such as, say, Jerry Lewis's The Day the Clown Cried, being so freely available everywhere but here. So as a cinematic text, it has had a status at once marginal and canonical. However, there remains its strange position in the history of censorship. Was Kubrick effectively the victim of censorship, or its most notorious and autocratic perpetrator? Without question, his film appeared to have been the inspiration for horrifying acts of rape and murder. Copycat delinquents and wannabe yobbos swaggered around London's west end and football terraces in bowlers and eyeliner, and these incidents were gloatingly magnified on the news pages and shrilly denounced in the leader columns. Outspoken judges hammered Kubrick's film, and home secretary Reginald Maudling solemnly requested a private screening. Certainly, its reception as a film was very different from the purely literary reception Burgess had experienced when the book came out 10 years earlier, in 1962 - part of the huge frenzy of work Burgess embarked on when he thought (wrongly) that he was dying of an inoperable brain tumour. It seemed at this stage to belong to a more cerebral and muted tradition of satire and dystopia: the worlds of Swift, Orwell or Huxley. Provocative, yes, splenetic, certainly, but not incendiary, not an incitement to riot. The book had no very great circulation until the film version appeared, based, to Burgess's considerable chagrin, on the American edition, which had excised a final, emollient chapter showing the older Alex appearing to repudiate violence. As a film, its context was quite different. It seemed to belong to a newer, 70s cinematic movement, along with Peckinpah's Straw Dogs and Jewison's Rollerball - sleeker, sexier, more troubling in their amoral violence. Kubrick himself could not or would not justify his film, so the job fell to Burgess; the worldly, well-travelled writer was a natural media performer, and one who was aware that he owed fame and fortune to Kubrick. Only when Burgess was wheeled out did the general public become widely aware of the inspiration for the original text: an assault by four army deserters on his pregnant wife in 1944, an appalling event which he had creatively merged both with the Teds-and-Rockers clashes he witnessed on returning to 60s Britain after many years abroad, and the teenage hooliganism he and his wife had seen on holiday in Russia in 1961. This terrible personal history became a vital part of the Clockwork Orange myth. Burgess now assumed an unquestioned moral authority to speak in the film's defence, for had he and his wife not suffered directly as a result of precisely this sort of violence? But, for all this, it was never banned. The film's commercial run ended; the moral panic subsided and the unspoken consensus seemed to be that there was no increase in the quantum of crime. Put baldly, the rapists and criminals were doing what they would have done anyway, except with funny make-up. It was only in 1979, when the NFT was unable to screen it for a Kubrick retrospective, that anyone realised what the director had done. Infuriatingly, Kubrick never favoured his audience with a clear explanation, leaving anti-censorship liberals like me unsure whether to revere him or not. It may be that, with the magnificent self-belief of the artist, and displeased with a British establishment that had misrepresented a serious work of art, he was exercising his prerogative of deciding who gets to see his film and where. Perhaps he was sick and tired of being made the scapegoat for society's violence, or was understandably scared by (rumoured) death threats against his family. But withdrawing his film also looks, then as now, like a monumental loss of nerve, and a catastrophic concession to the pro-censorship lobby. Removing it from distribution here and nowhere else, and, moreover, appearing to retreat to the secrecy of his Hertfordshire hideaway, was arguably a pusillanimous abnegation of responsibility. Why was it all right for the rest of the world to experience the socio-cultural consequences of A Clockwork Orange - whatever they may be - and not the United Kingdom, where Kubrick happened to live? Did the director believe his film really was dangerous? The only answers are to be found in the film itself, which anticipates in the most extraordinary way the whole question of censorship, screen violence, the imposition of power by the judiciary and media as the agents of the state - all the questions in which Kubrick and his most famous film have been entangled for nearly 30 years. Seeing this remarkable and very British film for the first time is an exhilarating and disturbing experience. So far from being dated, it seems, in many respects, breathtakingly in advance of almost anything else around in its torsions and its longueurs, its magnificent coups du cinÃ©ma, its narrative scope and sweep, and its moments of sheer, bizarre offensiveness \"intentional and unintentional\". A Clockwork Orange deserves to be called a work of raddled genius, if anything does, with all that the word implies of dysfunction, waywardness and dazzling, delirious insight. It is like seeing a mixture of Jacobean revenge drama, 18th-century picaresque novel, sci-fi porn and horror comic. Only in its quaint and questionable approach to women and rape is Clockwork Orange a let-down - of which, more in a moment. From the very first shot, of the charismatic tearaway Alex (Malcolm McDowell) smirking at the camera, we are immersed in the disquieting tale of the leader of a menacing gang of costumed \"droogs\". They speak in \"nadsat\", Burgess's quasi-Joycean experimental youth patois, a hybrid of English, Latin and Russian, a literary and linguistic adventure that already puts this picture in an IQ league miles above everything else. They dress in fetishistic costumes and make-up, and stage sadistic beatings and sexual assaults. Alex is finally arrested and subjected to grotesque psychological experiments. The shock of recognition is what hits you first. Is that a cherubic young Warren Clarke as Alex's mutinous sidekick Dim? Is that a sideburned Steven Berkoff as a thuggish police sergeant? Can that possibly be Michael Bates as the shriekingly malevolent prison guard - an actor that my thirtysomething generation remembers solely as the blacked-up punkah-wallah in the 70s sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum? A Clockwork Orange is a virtual gallery of British character actors, including Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp and Margaret Tyzack. It is at least partly their presence that gives A Clockwork Orange elements of an early 70s soft-core sex comedy - with McDowell as a kind of Bizarro-world Robin Askwith, larking about with his mates, picking up birds at the local record shop and getting laid. The rape scenes that caused all the flap then are pretty wince-making now: unpleasant and uncomfortable for the wrong reasons. There are quite a few: a woman is brutally raped to Singin' in the Rain, while the audience is forced into the position of her husband, bound, gagged and made to watch. A woman is almost raped by a rival gang, and there is another sexual assault in the filmed violence Alex is made to watch in prison. A Clockwork Orange shows that the master's penchant for tits-and-panties semi-nudity did not begin with Eyes Wide Shut; there is a lot of raunchy sashaying about from bare-breasted women and the juxtaposition of these swinging moments with fairly crude rape scenes suggests that Kubrick mentally filed rape under \"sex\" rather than \"violence\". The assault on the tramp that begins the film still delivers a spine-tingling shock to the senses: a hypnotically unpleasant moment. After a few liveners in the weird milk-bar, with its pseudo-sexy decor and fashion-shoot lighting, the droogs arrive at a strange, deserted underpass to see a drunk, prostrate tramp singing. When they sneeringly start to applaud, the sense of imminent violence is horrible, chillingly enhanced by its strange, semi-realist setting. This violence has been widely called amoral, and this is probably right; it was a misplaced gallantry for the film's supporters to claim it is \"intensely moral\". That is not really true, though there is a queasy slickness to the violence, a balletic ritualisation that arguably acts as a prophylactic, as Alexander Walker has argued. (And the slow-motion scene of the droogs strolling along the marina is very reminiscent of Mr Blue, Mr Orange et al.) But what is also important is that A Clockwork Orange, in its own warped way, shows the consequences of violence, and gives violence an intelligible context. The tramp is not forgotten; he returns at the end and exacts a terrible vengeance. And we learn that the victim of Alex's rape died after the assault, ostensibly of an unrelated illness, but that her grieving widower knows in his heart that the rapist is guilty. It is a strangely affecting moment, unexpectedly drawing on the messiness and pathos of real life. It is the scenes in prison that take A Clockwork Orange into the realms of inspiration; here it becomes a brilliant essay in cynicism and paranoia, rooted in an age in which Harold Wilson's progressivism had been trounced in the 1970 general election by Ted Heath's \"Selsdon\" project of political reaction, an age in which race violence was on the increase and the Northern Ireland Troubles had just begun. Keen to clear \"ordinary\" criminals like Alex out of prison to make room for political subversives, the government makes him the guinea-pig for a fast-track rehabilitation-brainwash: an aversion therapy in which he is forced to watch scenes of violence, his eyelids clipped open, saline solution dropped into his flinching eyeballs. The ghosts of Foucault and RD Laing attend Kubrick's vision of the state's economy of violence: how criminal aberrance is countered with clinical, scientific subjection. These scenes are unforgettably horrible and offer a prescient commentary on censorship: here is the traumatised cinemagoer, unable to stop the state flooding his consciousness with screen images of violence. Is this the censor's world turned upside down? Or actually the power of the censor writ large - the censor's yearning to control and regulate human reaction to screen images? (\"It's funny how the colours of the real, real world are not real until you viddy them on film,\" muses Alex between sessions, anticipating a very modern critical discourse on how we have come to think of screen representations of the world as more real than reality itself.) Finally, Kubrick shows the nation being scandalised by this technique, via headlines in the Telegraph and the old broadsheet Mail - eerily, just the sort of newspaper hue-and-cry which would drive A Clockwork Orange off the screen. What an incredible punch Clockwork Orange packs, like a visitor from another planet, among the production-line dullness of most cinema. This is ironic violence, stylised violence, but violence with human consequences and human cost. The reissuing of A Clockwork Orange is a reclamation of part of movie history. While American movie brats such as Coppola, Scorsese, Friedkin and Altman were making the 70s a thrilling era for movie-making, it turns out that this country had a part to play in it as well. Here in Britain, Kubrick was showing that the spirit of the Easy Riders, Raging Bulls era was conceived not just in Los Angeles, Burbank and Manhattan, but in Radlett and Harpenden and St Albans. For all its flaws and cracks, this is a film that has to be seen, and its re-release is a festival day in the history of British cinema. A very British nightmare How the press reacted \"What on earth induced our censors to pass these startling scenes of rape and violence?... You could have understood a shoddy director dragging them in to gloss over his technical deficiencies, but there are no technical deficiencies about Stanley Kubrick and his film is far too good to need bolstering up with such repellent shock tactics.\" Cecil Wilson, Daily Mail \"An essentially British nightmare in its attentions to caste, manners, accents and the state of mind created by a kind of weary socialism... A Clockwork Orange is so beautiful to look at and to hear that it dazzles the senses and the mind, even as it turns the old real red vino to ice.\" Vincent Canby, New York Times \"Kubrick seems to be conducting a detailed investigation into the social, political, scientific and psychological control mechanisms functioning in contemporary man, and in the society that he has created. Nothing less.\" Tony Palmer, Spectator \"Let me report simply that A Clockwork Orange manifests itself on the screen as a painless, bloodless and ultimately pointless futuristic fantasy.\" Andrew Sarris, Village Voice \"The belief that our children will reproduce us is what has kept the race going, but seeing Clockwork Orange one's faith is blasted. From it one brings away the fear that our children will kill us all.\" Alexander Walker, London Evening Standard \"It is not a film the memory of which you will exactly wish to cherish. You may even, like me, reject the glib and icy pessimism of its message. But you will, I can assure you, find it difficult to put out of mind.\" Derek Malcolm, Guardian â¢ A Clockwork Orange is released on March 17. â¢ Find out more about Anthony Burgess on Books Unlimited."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2000/mar/04/religion.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-04T01:37:06Z","webTitle":"Work and women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/04/religion.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/mar/04/religion.uk","fields":{"headline":"Work and women","bodyText":"This weekend, the churches of the United Kingdom are thinking and praying about the needs of women across the world. Although I have enjoyed all the benefits of education, technology, transport, fast communications and satisfying professional work, and - for a large part of my life - been able to exercise choice, not all women in our culture have that luxury. Women make up 44% of the UK labour force, but some have their options closed very early. Lone parenthood, for example, does not confer wide career opportunities, nor do the demands of being carers. Some women are trapped in low-paid jobs or the spiral of poverty and abuse. In third-world countries, the limitations are multiplied. Women's lives there are as demanding as anywhere in Europe or North America, yet their choices are often minimal. Sharp inequalities exist in healthcare and nutrition, education and training, and in earnings. Where men endure hardship and deprivation, women endure them more; where men struggle for access to education and training, women struggle more. This is not because women in these countries have no access to paid work. The figures compare with those in the west; women make up 42% of the workforce in sub-saharan Africa, yet experience fewer benefits from work. A large part of women's work is in low-paid occupations - usually agriculture. In such subsistence economies, they do not have the choice between stay-at-home motherhood or paid employment. They have both. Here, work does not open up choices and lifestyle improvements - indeed, it may close them down. This is partly because the employment of women is not the result of education, but often instead of it. Among Ethiopian women over 25, for example, illiteracy rates are as high as 89%. Their labour is simply needed for survival. They often have little job security and minimal access to further training. They have also little opportunity to accumulate savings, or receive credit. Many of the funding programmes designed to help developing countries have not worked in women's interests. Men have tended to be the beneficiaries of structural adjustment programmes because they spend more time - double that of women - producing marketable goods for export. Yet, the reality of external debt impacts as much on women as on men. So does the experience of being on the wrong end of global trade networks, where what they produce is at the mercy of a first-world pricing system. When we get our goods cheap, it is often third-world women who are picking up the tab. With its global network, the Christian church is in a position to effect real change here. Working in partnership with third-world women, Christian organisations like Tear Fund have been developing educational projects, setting up clinics, extending literacy for girls, installing boreholes for fresh water and initiating new small businesses. Because money from the UK becomes vastly inflated in poor economies, whatever the churches raise can produce extraordinary results. Fair-trading programmes also restructure the trading relationship, paying coffee-bean pickers more, and accepting profits that are less. When women work two-thirds of the world's hours, receive one-tenth of the world's income and own one-hundredth of the world's property, we need the moral will to begin a structural change. In affluent Britain, this involves re-examining the ethics of choice - for freedom of choice brings moral obligations. If our freedom to spend and consume is enjoyed at the expense of women in the third world, it must be too costly. â¢ Elaine Storkey is president of Tear Fund"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/mar/04/china.johngittings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-04T12:34:33Z","webTitle":"From peasant economy to PCs in rural China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/04/china.johngittings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/mar/04/china.johngittings","fields":{"headline":"From peasant economy to PCs in rural China","bodyText":"Ms Liu, wearing a bright red sash, hands out leaflets in the centre of Hefei for a new hand-held computer. \"You need it as much as your mobile,\" she explains excitedly. \"When you plunge into the sea of commerce, you will succeed in everything you do!\" A few yards away, an older unrelated Ms Liu has plunged into a different sea. Laid off three years ago from a paper factory, she is shining shoes in a scheme run by the local labour federation. A basic polish costs two renminbi (15p) - but four will buy a de luxe shine. Working every other day in a job-share, she can earn 400 renminbi a month. Hefei is the capital of Anhui, long known as a poor province whose beggars headed for Shanghai. The city is at last on the move, though a long way behind its richer counterparts, Nanjing to the south and Wuhan upstream. Anhui has a population of 61m - slightly more than the United Kingdom - in an area the size of England and Wales. The future of China's economic and social development - due to be discussed in Beijing at next week's national people's congress - must largely depend on the prospects for Anhui and similarly less advanced regions. The province is in a state of early transition seen in the coastal regions 10 years ago: new brick houses are replacing the old mud-and-thatch cottages in the villages; more than 2,500 miles of new road were built last year. Hefei still has pedicabs but also an abundance of cheap taxis. A new pedestrianised shopping street cuts through the old city: the evening newspaper is available on the web. A temple houses a busy market selling mainly shoes. The old city wall has been replaced by a lakeside park. Beyond the wall, joint-venture factories are multiplying and new blocks of flats spread as far as the new railway station. The Hefei university of technology - a centre of pro-democracy activity in the 1980s but now politically silent - still attracts most of its students from outside the province. Yet Anhui remains a predominantly rural province. Its workforce has the sixth highest percentage of peasants in the country. So far the safety valve has been the huge appetite of rich urban and coastal China for cheap labour. Groups of young male peasants, clad in cheap clothes for the city with a few bundles of belongings, wait by the roadside on the main highway. They ride the long journey to Shanghai and other coastal cities on dust-coated \"sleeper buses\" with two decks of bunks crammed together. Entire village economies are supported by the migrants' remittances home. As many as 40% of the young men go out to do manual labour - a modern equivalent of the beggars who used to go out to ask for food. Everyone now realises that this is not a long-term solution, but the success of efforts to escape the rural poverty trap varies between Anhui's 56 rural counties. The difference depends not only on economic resources but on local initiative. \"We need to be able to satisfy the peasants' demands on the spot,\" says Wu Xuming, the Communist party boss of the fast-developing Ningguo county. \"This is a mountainous area with poor roads where sick people still have to be carried to hospital in a litter. The most important task is to raise our economic strength locally.\" Ningguo has the advantage of being located on one of the province's few railway lines, and can offer cheaper power and wages than richer Jiangsu province to the south. Foreign investment in Ningguo includes a large company making spare parts for US and German car manu facturers. The workers' wage is 500-600 renminbi a month - cheap for the employer but more than twice the average rural income. Another car-parts factory, owned by a well-known Ningguo entrepreneur, pays more than 30,000 renminbi a year to senior staff. They live in detached villas with lawns in an upmarket estate. Some even have integral garages - though none yet own cars. Ningguo has a relatively small population of 350,000 and most of its leaders come from outside the county - said to be an advantage in overcoming \"local xenophobia\". It also claims the distinction of possessing the only three-star hotel at county level in the whole of China: its heated rooms are equipped with mini-bars. Zongyang in the northern corner of Anhui, bordering the bleak mudbanks of the Yangtze river, is much further behind. Zongyang's mayor, Tang Zhijian, also claims to be confident about the future. There are leaders in the Chinese people's political consultative conference who will speak up for Zongyang's population of nearly 1m, he insists. He says Zongyang is planning to build a new power station. But when asked to supply some written material on Zongyang, local officials say nothing is available. Even Zongyang's newspaper is for internal circulation only - not to be read by a foreign journalist. This more circumscribed outlook can hardly help narrow the gap. Whether Anhui's backward counties can follow the national trajectory of development must also depend on the fight against corruption, which appears as serious here as elsewhere in China. Last week the provincial government met in Hefei to hear an outspoken report from the governor, Xu Zhonglin. \"Cadres must not only discipline themselves,\" said Mr Xu. \"They must be strict with their spouses, children, relatives and entourage to stop their positions being exploited for illegal business.\" He denounced those who \"will not investigate corruption, turn a blind eye to it, obstruct efforts being made, and shelter those who are guilty. But it will take more than words to convince cynical public opinion in the streets of Hefei. Three days after Mr Xu spoke, laid-off workers from a Hefei factory demonstrated outside the provincial headquarters. A taxi-driver held up in the traffic jam cursed the government, not the demonstrators. \"The workers are crushed by the cadres. They have every right to complain,\" he said. The people of Anhui and other less-favoured parts of China remain to be convinced they will have a fair share in the nation's prosperity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/mar/04/4","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-04T18:53:41Z","webTitle":"First footing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/mar/04/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/mar/04/4","fields":{"headline":"First footing","bodyText":"What am I looking for as I roam Thailand, notebook and tape recorder in hand, on assignment for Lonely Planet? Believe it or not, \"unspoiled\" beaches are the last thing I hope to find. Most \"unspoiled\" beaches I've come across in my two-plus decades of drifting through the kingdom were doomed before I ever got there. Doomed whether I wrote about them or not, doomed in the sense that their existence could not possibly be kept a secret for very long. I've never come across a beach that I hadn't already heard about from other travellers. Can I preserve a beach by not writing about it? If I were the only person writing guidebooks about Thailand, it might be possible, but in a field crowded with competing guides, it's highly unlikely. But by writing about the fragility of the coastal ecosystem, and about the many threats a beach may face - not just from tourism, but from shrimp farming, charcoal manufacturing, and other enterprises - I might be able to contribute to an awareness that could lead to appropriate conservation measures. Long before 20th Century Fox arrived at Ao Maya on Ko Phi-Phi Leh, I was writing about environmental devastation in Ko Phi-Phi - Hat Noppharat Thara National Marine Park. Yet every time I visited Phi-Phi, there were more tourists than ever, many of them carrying Lonely Planet guides advising them not to visit Phi-Phi. Visitors continue to flood Phi-Phi because it is - or was - a pretty destination and the Thais have provided plenty of infrastructure catering to tourists. Take away that infrastructure and the numbers would plummet. Enforcing national park regulations in Thailand would go a very long way towards keeping the high worldwide demand for beach tourism from destroying the environment and diluting the culture. A guidebook can only do so much. Some responsibility must be cultivated by the host country and by the visitors themselves. As for pushing farther and farther towards the \"undiscovered\", I understand how people with a taste for adventure might feel when they come to a place and find a lot of people from their own culture there. I understand why people might get annoyed and bored by that. But when you want it to be all for you and you only - that I don't understand. People use Lonely Planet to find new places - and then when they find anyone else there, they become angry with LP! Did Sal and Daffy in The Beach read about the Ang Thong Archipelago - the setting for the infamous beach in the novel - in their Lonely Planet guide, or did they find it on their own? They were looking for a place that wasn't in Lonely Planet, yet Ang Thong is in Lonely Planet and has been for years. It's also on all the maps. This attitude, that you're going to find some untouched part of Asia that no one else will see, that it will be your own private little experience - it's a rather counterproductive, delusional, and perhaps hypocritical western idea. People imagine they want to visit a non-western society, and they want to make sure no other westerner is there but themselves. The contradiction: If you're a westerner, and you're there, then your chosen spot is already \"polluted\". You're polluting it. Your moral choice: stay home, thereby restricting your knowledge of, and thus your participation in, the world outside your door; or travel consciously, learning what you can about the culture and environment, and treating both with respect. If you're looking for authentic Thailand, and having a hard time locating it, don't blame your guidebook. Blame your own imagination. It's easy enough to stay well off the package-tour circuit if you follow two simple rules. Rule one: stay as far away from airports as possible. One reason three Andaman archipelagos, Tarutao, Similan, and Surin, have remained relatively free of environmental (and cultural) degradation is because you can't fly there, and you can't reach them in a short boat ride, either. Rule two: Forget about palm trees. Palm trees fuel the European taste for the exotic. Meanwhile Thais are bored with palms, which are no more exciting to them than your neighbourhood elms. You'll find all of the non-palmy beaches of south Thailand - the ones lined with casuarina or sea pines, from Prachuap Khiri Khan to Narathiwat - to be so laid-back you may have to bring your own lunch. And if you do sniff out a beach that satisfies you, don't tell Daffy. â¢ Joe Cummings is the author of the Lonely Planet guide to Thailand and Thailand's Islands &amp; Beaches .

In return, she wanted a sale. She held up two fingers - which meant 2,000 kips - for the bracelet, no doubt expecting to be haggled down to 1,000. The driver of our jumbo - like a tuk-tuk but larger - said something that astounded her and then turned to us and said the price was 10,000 kips. Every one's head turned. Everyone froze. Would we pay 10 times the going rate?Why not? She needed it. We didn't. I handed over the money and took the bracelet. She was stunned. Everyone gawped. All over a miserly Â£1.50. And it was suddenly clear what an amazing ride many Lao and hilltribe people are going to have as western commerce, tourism and media take off in the emerging Divine Kingdom. You do not get that kind of experience in Vientiane, the capital. But we were travelling through Laos from the west, an unusual way into the country at the moment, and people have not had time to catch up with the ways and opportunities of the falangs, the name for westerners. We flew up to Chiang Rai, in northern Thailand, from Bangkok and took a bus to the frontier town of Chiang Khong, where we bought our visas through an intermediary for $50 each. The next morning, the ferry carrying half-a-dozen backpackers and ourselves edged across the Mekong to Huey Xai. We went through the formalities, exchanged Â£100 for a huge wad of 660,000 kips, and got a jumbo to where the fast boats were moored. They were not exaggerating, I thought, as the fast boat rocketed off along the Mekong in the direction of Luang Prabang. The stylish, brightly-painted rowing boat with a car engine bolted on the back was fast - 0-50mph in seconds. Within minutes, the thrill of speed gave way to the interest of river life and the unfolding scenery, jagged hills fading blue to grey, until, thanks to the vagarious nature of the Mekong's course, we arrived at Luang Prabang as the sun set in front of us. From there, it was another 20 miles of dusty roads before we arrived, battered and dishevelled, at the best hotel in town, the Villa Santi, which was once owned by a princess and which is more accustomed to welcoming well-groomed guests who arrive in a limousine from the airport. Laos, like Thailand, is a Theravada Buddhist state: 60% of the population, probably 90% in towns, lives by the dhama, or universal law; the rest are mostly rural hill tribe animists. Luang Prabang, the historic royal city, embodies that Buddhist spirit with its 32 wats - temple complexes - and hundreds of monks and novices. The gentle people live by the same set of beliefs: do good, receive good; do evil, receive evil. It works in a town that practises what Buddha preached. We emerged from the Villa Santi in the mild air of the February morning to explore its historic area between the confluence of the Mekong and Khan rivers. The temples date back to the 16th century but almost every one has been destroyed and rebuilt at some time because of invasions by the Siamese, Chinese, and Burmese, among others. Xieng Thong is the classic Luang Prabang wat, with its distinctive deeply-sloping roofs, its royal funeral chapel (housing an enormous funeral carriage holding royal ashes guarded by a dramatic naga , Buddha's seven-headed serpent so loved by Lao temple designers) and a unique reclining Buddha. We sat in the shade, looking at the chapels and chedis, the ripple of the blossom, and the slow and dignified passage of the monks. Most people who visit Luang Prabang make the journey to the Pak Ou caves, with their 4,000 Buddha images. They tend to travel the 25 miles by boat but we hired a jumbo. It was a hilariously bad ride that we wouldn't have missed and the trip included June, my wife, earning her rice by taking up the good-natured challenge of the women road workers to help dig foundations. Unesco, in its citation for Luang Prabang's elevation to world heritage site (with the consequent inflow of much needed restoration money), said the town uniquely blended Lao and French colonial influences. Its laid-back atmosphere, open-air eating places that lure you into gluttony and the warm people make it easy to simply enjoy the legacy of the past without reflecting on the horrors that the people have seen: from the US bombing campaign to civil war, and the imprisonment and deaths of the king, queen and the last prince less than two decades ago. We left Luang Prabang in a clapped-out coach on the notorious Route 13. The coach was better than the people-carrying truck that was the alternative and it carried a mechanic because everyone, including us, expected it to break down. It did. Twice. The second time, the transmission fell out and the crew worked heroically as nightfall approached. They say Highway 13 is safe now that the army has moved in but until four years ago, Hmong guerrillas were carrying out raids with automatic weapons. We saw no soldiers and heard, while waiting for the bus to be fixed, only the hauntingly beautiful sound of a woman singing as she worked in the wilderness of the high hills. Vang Vieng, two-thirds of the way to Vientiane, must be among the world's most beautiful places. But not when we arrived at midnight with everywhere closed and the streets pitch black. We managed to rouse a family with rooms to let - bed, shower, kindly concern, all for Â£1.80. The town, which feels more like a village, is built in the sweep of the Nam Song river, with endlessly enticing views towards the horizon of limestone crags and hills. Those hills offer a dozen interesting caves and caverns - we opted for a distant cave and hired a motorised ox-cart. A point at my flip-flops and a universal \"OK?\" brought a warm affirmative from the driver. It wasn't that he didn't understand me: it was just that he thought it was quite OK to climb 650ft up boulders, some sections almost vertical, in flip-flops. But the effort was well rewarded: the great cavern and, in a pale light from a higher opening, a 20ft reclining Buddha. The bus down to Vientiane was crowded. But it did not prepare us for the maelstrom that is the city centre, dusty enough to make breathing difficult with none of the easy-going friendliness of Luang Pra bang. But, beyond the scrum of the centre, there was the charm of gentle places and gentle people. Pha That Luang - the Great Stupa - is where Buddhism and the state fuse, the former legitimising the latter and the whole becoming the symbol of nationhood. Its golden form encodes Buddhist doctrine from statues at ground level to the central spire, a stylised lotus bud symbolising the growth of the person from the mud of ignorance to the sunshine of enlightenment. We climbed the steps into the monument and later sat in the serene, walled grounds for several hours. A monk walked by and smiled; a family was harassed round by a tour guide; a young couple idled away half an hour. But we saw no one else at this, the country's premier monument. The people at Wat Si Muang, the busiest temple in the city, welcomed us during their day of making merit by taking gifts of flowers, incense, candles and fruit. June made merit by releasing two tiny birds from a cage and a young novice gave us bananas and cut coconuts so we could drink the milk from the shells. Si Muang is the temple where people go to make wishes. If their wishes are granted, they must return with gifts of fruit. When we return, we shall take bananas and coconuts to Wat Si Muang.

The Observer' s revelation adds to a list of legal hiccups which have brought into question civil servants' state of readiness for the introduction of the convention into Scottish law. The Executive plans to change the law within two months to remove the anomaly over bail for murderers, but any case before that date could be open to challenge. Last week the European Court of Human Rights awarded Â£1,000 to a man convicted of manslaughter because he had been denied his basic rights when applying for bail. The problem is simple. Article 5, paragraph three, of the convention states that the first judge a person accused of a killing sees must have the power to grant bail. That is impossible under Scots law. An accused will first see a sheriff, who has no powers to grant bail in cases of murder. The accused must apply for bail by making a specific plea to the High Court after seeing the sheriff. Clive Caballero had already been convicted of manslaughter when he faced new charges of rape. His solicitor didn't apply for bail as, under English law, bail cannot be granted to a defendant with a previous serious conviction. He was subsequently convicted of the rape. Caballero argued that being refused the option of bail was a violation of the European Convention. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously in his favour and awarded him Â£1,000 in damages and Â£15,250 costs and expenses, less the amount received in legal aid from the Council of Europe. Legal experts say the same could occur in Scotland. Though the law is different on the point of bail between the two countries, they both automatically deny bail in certain categories of crime. 'There is no doubt Scots law falls foul of the European Convention on this point,' said Professor Allan Miller of Strathclyde University. Tory leader David McLetchie raised the issue in Holyrood during Thursday's debate on the impact of the convention on Scots law. 'Some believe that the current situation with regard to bail for murder is in breach of ECHR; because a sheriff does not have the power to authorise bail in such cases, it could be argued that bringing someone before a court without the necessary power to authorise their release on bail infringes their rights under Article 5 of the convention.' His suspicion was right. Justice Minister Jim Wallace admitted as much in his response, but only said the executive was monitoring the impact of the Caballero case. 'We have taken note of the recent judgment in the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Caballero v United Kingdom and will consider our response to that. If that requires legislation, I will bring proposals to the Parliament. We are trying both to anticipate and to react.' The law regarding bail is just the latest in a string of cases where the introduction of the ECHR will alter Scots law. The use of temporary sheriffs was found illegal last year and recently Section 172 of the Traffic Act was deemed at fault under the European Convention. As The Observer exclusively reported a month ago, the Scottish Executive is conducting an audit of Scots law and governmental practice to see what else needs to be changed under the ECHR. It is expected that the treatment of children in the legal system and legal aid arrangements will also have to be altered. The audit must be completed within months as the entire statute book must be compatible with the convention by October, when it is incorporated into UK law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/mar/05/biography","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-05T23:35:13Z","webTitle":"He gave Victoria the Koh-i Noor.

In 1997, during the controversy over Switzerland's 'Nazi gold', the Swiss Bankers' Association published a list of more than 1,800 'dormant accounts' and other deposits untouched for the past half century. Though most had belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust, one of the unclaimed boxes in a Swiss bank vault was the property of an Indian princess who, improbably, was 'last heard of in 1942 living in Penn, Bucks'. The princess turned out to be the deceased daughter of Maharajah Duleep Singh, last Emperor of the Sikhs. 'Nazi Gold Fortune Awaits the Heirs of Maharajah,' ran the headline over a Sunday Telegraph article written by Christy Campbell soon after the publication of the Swiss bankers' list. Scores of applicants laid claim to the treasure. All were to be disappointed. Just as Campbell was finishing his book, he discovered that the maharajah's box was empty. The empty box, however, set Campbell on the trail of one of the most extraordinary characters in the history of the British Raj. As a nine-year-old in 1849, Duleep was coerced by the British into signing away his kingdom in the Punjab and giving the Koh-i-Noor, the world's most celebrated diamond, to Queen Victoria. His British guardian supervised his conversion to Christianity and removed him to Britain at the age of 15. Victoria, to whom Duleep was presented, found him 'handsome' with 'a pretty, graceful and dignified manner'. Duleep's tragedy was that for the rest of his life he never truly succeeded in either reconciling or choosing between his native and adopted cultures. He set up home at Elveden Hall in Suffolk, which he gave a flamboyantly mock-oriental interior and an even more flamboyant menagerie. Parrots flew around the house, apes occupied the kitchen garden, kangaroos hopped beneath the spreading cedars and missions were sent to India to bring back hawks for the mews. The Elveden estate became renowned for hunting parties which sometimes massacred more than 3,000 head of game in a single day. Duleep won a reputation as one of the best shots in Britain, as well as acquiring a string of mistresses and becoming an habituÃ© of fashionable London salons. In his forties, however, Duleep began to fantasise about winning back his lost kingdom and became drawn into the Great Game being played out between the British Raj and Tsarist Russia on the North-West Frontier. Queen Victoria was sufficiently alarmed to write to him in 1886, complaining about 'extraordinary reports of your intending to transfer your allegiance to Russia! I cannot believe this of you who have always professed such loyalty and devotion towards me, who you know have always been your true friend and who I may say took a maternal interest in you from the time, when now 32 years ago, you came to England as a beautiful and charming Boy!' He sent an even more bizarre reply, admitting that he'd offered his services to Russia but begging 'to be permitted to subscribe myself your Majesty's most devoted humble servant'. Closely observed by British and Russian agents, Duleep made his way to Russia in 1887, announcing that, with Russian assistance, he would 'guarantee an easy conquest of India' and 'end the cruel yoke of British rule'. Though his plans caused some alarm in India, they were little more than fantasies. After less than a year, he left Russia for France and wrote to Queen Victoria, demanding the return of the Koh-i-Noor diamond which he intended to use to finance an Indian rebellion. In 1890, however, he was reduced to begging Queen Victoria's forgiveness, writing to her: 'I feel that in fighting against your country I have been fighting against God. I would return to England were I assured of your free pardon.' Campbell does not persuade me that Duleep played any significant part in the Great Game. He has, however, written a readable, entertaining and well-researched biography of a flamboyant but ultimately tragic figure caught between two cultures. For some members of Britain's Sikh community, Campbell's conclusions are bound to prove controversial. In July 1999, the Prince of Wales unveiled at Thetford an equestrian statue of Duleep, commissioned by the Maharajah Duleep Singh Centenary Trust. An inscription on the statue records: 'Even today, the Sikh nation aspires to regain its sovereignty', and says of Duleep: 'He died in Paris having re-embraced the Sikh faith while still engaged in a struggle to reclaim his throne.' Campbell shows, however, that in 1893 Duleep died a Christian. There was no Sikh cremation of his remains. Instead, his embalmed body was transported in a dark oak coffin across the Channel to a funeral in St Andrew's Church, Elveden, conducted by the rector. Among the wreaths was one from the Prince of Wales, inscribed 'For auld lang syne', and another from Balmoral marked simply 'From Queen Victoria'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2000/mar/07/johnaglionby","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-07T01:41:20Z","webTitle":"Sultan of Brunei sues playboy brother","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/07/johnaglionby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/mar/07/johnaglionby","fields":{"headline":"Sultan of Brunei sues playboy brother","bodyText":"The sultan of Brunei has lifted the veil of autocratic mystery that surrounds his tiny oil-rich kingdom and is risking personal embarrassment in an attempt to halt the decline of his own vast fortune and recoup billions of pounds allegedly embezzled by his younger brother. Hassanal Bolkiah, the feudal monarch of the nation on the north coast of Borneo, has close links to Britain's royal family and to the owner of Harrods, Mohamed Al Fayed. He named 71 people on Sunday night as parties in a multi-billion-pound civil suit against his brother, Prince Jefri Bolkiah. The playboy prince, whose assets include the Dorchester hotel in London and the jeweller's Asprey, is accused of \"improper withdrawal and use\" of state funds to prop up his company, Amedeo Development Corporation, when he was finance minister and chairman of the country's overseas investment agency in the mid 1990s. It is alleged that more than Â£2bn was involved in the unsuccessful rescue operation. The profligate Prince Jefri claimed he was the victim of palace intrigue when he was sacked in 1998, accusing Muslim conservatives \"backed by shadowy foreign advisers with questionable motives\" of plotting his downfall. He is now staying conspicuously silent and is being advised by the high-powered, London-based, commercial lawyers Alan Gordon Pollock QC and Clare Patricia Montgomery QC, who arrived in the kingdom at the weekend. No date has been set for a hearing and proceedings are being held in private. The sultan has frozen his brother's assets at home and abroad. These include thousands of cars, dozens of houses, a luxury yacht named Tits and its accompanying speed-boats, Nipple I and Nipple II. Public figures in Brunei say it would be \"inappropriate\" to discuss the case. Foreign diplomats believe that this is a clear sign that people, who are intensely loyal to the sultan, are afraid to rock an already delicate situation. \"Nothing like this has ever happened in Brunei,\" one diplomat said. \"Everything has always been kept hushed up in the past. The sultan obviously feels the public ignominy is worth it.\" The sultan, 53, is feeling the pinch. Five years ago he was worth more than Â£40bn and by far the world's richest man. Forbes magazine valued him last year at about half that and only number three in the world (the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, was at number one). The sultan's coffers are now thought to be even emptier, with one recent report putting his fortune at under Â£10bn. Regal concern is also extending to the national economy. National growth in the nation of 300,000 people has averaged less than 2% over the last five years and the oil and gas that has fuelled the country's wealth is running out. But there is little diversification. In his national address at the end of last month the sultan admitted that Brunei is still dependent on oil and gas. He then published a national economic plan which amazed people by its candour. \"Although Brunei still has the appearance of great affluence, there are warning signals of fundamental economic problems which threaten to undermine the prosperity and, with it, the social stability of the people,\" the report said. \"Such honesty is unprecedented,\" the diplomat said. \"If the sultan thinks he's in trouble then it's easy to see why he's willing to go after Jefri.\" King of the jungle: Sultan and his country â¢ Brunei is a jungle-covered sultanate on the north coast of Borneo.

It's the index of the top 100 shares in the United Kingdom. It was originally called the Financial Times Stock Exchange index but is now known universally by its acronym FTSE and its chummier name Footsie. When did it start? The index was established in 1984 taking over from the All Share index, which included some 800 shares, to meet the need of traders for a narrower marker. The index began at a nominal figure of 1000 and is monitored by FTSE International, based in Moorgate. The index is updated every 15 seconds - at 11.47am today it stood at 6452.8. Who are the top 100? Every three months the membership of the index is reviewed. Normally two or three companies are replaced by new entrants whose value has increased during the previous quarter. Virtually all UK companies are eligible for inclusion. How much are the shares on the index worth altogether? As with the index itself, the total value of the 100 companies is calculated four times a minute. Vodafone is the current number one, making up around 15% of the value of the whole index. Yesterday that stood at Â£1,407,551,000 or around Â£1.4 trillion. Who cares about it? It is the UK's premier share index, as well recognised internationally as the Dow Jones in the USA , Dax in Germany and Cac in France. Why is it important? The Footsie is the UK's barometer of corporate health. It is also a guide to how the nation is faring. If the FTSE increases it means share prices are rising and that means a lot of people are getting richer. Because many pension and trust funds invest in FTSE 100 stock, millions are affected by the variation in the index's value. But why is the Footise so important today? At 5.30pm today the FTSE index committee meets to decide who is in and who is out for the coming quarter. Observers believe the index is due for its biggest shake-up. As many as 10 promotions and demotions are expected. Why the big upset? Technology and telecommunications stocks have gone through the roof. Companies providing internet-related products are booming. Some observers believe we are seeing a second industrial revolution and those in the markets see the future hinging on hi-tech. So who's in and who's out?

For a third person to help the divorcing partners work out, co-operatively, the consequences of their parting was revolutionary. The Finer Committee in 1973 recommended such a scheme, and the voluntary sector began to provide it in the late 1970s. John Haynes, who has died aged 67, was the inspirational mediator who taught the new profession how to do it. A skilful teacher, he was passionate that mediation should be a professional activity in its own right, not subsumed into legal practice, social work or counselling. The formation of the UK College of Family Mediators in 1995 reflects that determination. Haynes played a major, though indirect, part in achieving the inclusion of mediation into the family law act 1996, which led to its availability through legal aid. Born in Isleworth, Middlesex, he was educated at Ealing's Drayton Manor grammar school. After Royal Air Force national service he moved to the United States in 1957 and from 1964-72 was assistant to the president of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers. Because of his skills in conflict management he was invited to teach at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, from 1972-85, gaining his doctorate at the Union Institute, Ohio. He then moved into family mediation, and became the founding president of the Academy of Family Mediators. In 1984, he gave the inaugural lecture in London of the National Family Conciliation Council (later to become National Family Mediation), and began global travels which led to the training of 20,000 mediators - usually lawyers and social science professionals. He worked in North and South America, Europe, Australasia, South Africa, and the Soviet Union. He also continued to practise. His books formed the core of this new discipline and included Divorce Mediation: A Practical Guide For Therapists And Counsellors (1981) and, with his wife Gretchen, Mediating Divorce: A Casebook Of Strategies For Successful Family Negotiations. He was a founding member of the World Mediation Forum, whose conference in September he had been due to chair. Haynes's readiness to express his Quaker faith in finding goodness in people could be surprising. \"If you can't see good in your client,\" he observed, \" then dig for it\". He possessed humility, clarity, a zest for life, a mischievous sense of humour and generosity in sharing his ideas. He leaves Gretchen and his two daughters. A scholarship in his name has been established at the Union Institute. â¢ John Haynes, mediator, born October 28 1932; died December 22 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2000/mar/10/internationalwriting.culture7","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-10T01:32:24Z","webTitle":"Globe swotting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/mar/10/internationalwriting.culture7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2000/mar/10/internationalwriting.culture7","fields":{"headline":"Globe swotting","bodyText":"Let's say, for the sake of argument, that it's lunchtime.

If you're the Australian, you might be drooling your mayo over Sara Douglass's Crusader (Voyager, paperback, $19.95). Goodness only knows what it might be if you're in the Ukraine, Armenia, Turkmenistan or Bedford: whatever it is, it's unlikely to be familiar to your pen-friend in Malawi or Denmark. At a certain age, and at a certain stage of one's reading, even the most assiduous, the most compulsive of readers - the bibliomaniac - has to acknowledge that they can't read everything, unless they're Melvyn Bragg, of course, or Goethe. There comes a stage in one's reading when the only honest response to a friend's enthusing about his or her favourite author is to ask that which Harold Ross - son of an Ulsterman, who stood no nonsense - would scribble in the margins of the scripts and proofs at the New Yorker: \"Who he?\". Let's not pretend: when did you last read a book by any of the younger Russian novelists? You've read Victor Pelevin? Really? Chapaev i pustota, or the translation, The Clay Machine-Gun (Faber, Â£9.99)? Did you finish it? Did you understand it? A vague knowledge, a passing familiarity, a limp handshake, an acquaintance with one's own national literature is about the best that most of us can manage. Most \"foreign books\" - or as some of the American chain bookstores have it, \"Literature Not Yet Translated\" - simply do not take up space in another nation's mind, let alone on its bookshelves. To be English or Scottish or Irish or Welsh and to have read French literature means to have spent a lifetime struggling through the obvious two or three dozen books that most French students would have skimmed, absorbed and discarded by the age of 18. It is of course always amusing to meet someone from the Czech Republic, say, or Hungary, and to hear them claim that the most exciting contemporary English novelist is Malcolm Bradbury, but then visit France and try enthusing about how much you've enjoyed Camus, or Georges Perec. \"Have you read Dominique EddÃ©?\" your French friend might ask. To which the only honest reply, for most of us, is \"Who she?\". Readers get stuck in a rut. If you happen to have been born in Britain, for example, the chances are you will, by your late teens and early 20s, have developed a ruinous taste for biography. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be addicted to the heavyweights, such as Richard Holmes's 432-page Coleridge: Early Visions (HarperCollins, hardback, Â£15.99), or his 633-page Coleridge: Darker Reflections (HarperCollins, hardback, Â£19.99). You might just be dipping in to the occasional Humphrey Carpenter at weekends - you can handle it. You may even be one of the few not itching with excitement at the thought of Martin Amis's Experience, forthcoming from Jonathan Cape (ISSN: 0224050605), and according to his publisher \"destined to become a classic\". It may simply mean that you are a mackintoshed habituÃ© of the \"True Crime\" section in W H Smith, and are slowly, furtively adding over the years to your slightly stained bedside collection of books about the Krays, and serial killers, quietly stocking up, say, on Calling Time on the Krays: the Barmaid's Tale (Warner, Â£6.99), by Mrs X, or Sandra Harrisson Young's Destined for Murder: Profiles of Six Serial Killers With Astrological Commentary (Llewelyn, Â£10.99). Or it may only mean that you are a fan of the sub-autobiographical froth that sometimes passes for British fiction. Whatever the signs and symptoms, there's no doubt that biographies and autobiogra phies infest our small island, like rats and free local newspapers, and it's easy to see why. The legendary Leon Edel, Henry James's biographer, claimed that \"The secret of biography resides in finding the link between talent and achievement.\" The motive to discovering this link is what we amateur psychologists like to call envy, and everyone knows that envy grows rich and thick in damp, dark and crowded places like England. Imagine, though, that you had been born in Italy. Things might have been so different. Apart from wearing nicer shoes, you might have developed an enthusiasm for long poems in terza rima or for novels of great length and philosophical depth and distinction. On the other hand, you might have been born in Romania, and been seduced by Ionesco. Is it possible to overcome these limitations? The readers of the English-speaking nations have perhaps the greatest opportunity to do so - after all, we get a lot of books in translation, unlike, say, the 150,000 speakers of Gagauz in Moldavia, or the native Inuit, or the Cuzco Quechua speakers of Bolivia. These poor people may never get to read a book by Nick Hornby or Helen Fielding (but then again, the Bolivians have their epic drama, the Ollanta, and the West Greenlandic Inuit have a rich tradition of religious texts stretching back to the 18th century, which may be some consolation). The availability of books in translation may in fact be the problem. They queer the pitch. What sounds and reads like genius in the French can often seem like nothing but a moaning metaphysical drone when translated into English, and this may deter the reader from seeking out the original. Very often when reading books in translation, you have to make a huge effort to try and imagine the original texture and context and flavour, which has usually dried out or congealed in transit: it's like being faced with a black plastic plate of M&amp;S sushi fresh from Swindon and being asked to believe that you're eating Japanese food. It requires a willing suspension of disbelief. The literature of other nations, then, like the cuisine, and the children, always seems precocious, gross, too saucy, or simply dim-witted to the outsider. It's a sad fact, but literature often does not travel well - the manners and modes differ so greatly that they present a barrier to distant appreciation and understanding. This may explain, for example, why it is almost impossible for the English to understand American L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, or to really enjoy David Foster Wallace: you need to have been force-fed from an early age on Melville, Whitman, and Doctor Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham. These vast national differences and boundaries are reflected in miniature within states and nations, in the form of regional, ethnic, gender and class differences. It is of course unrealistic, although entertaining, to imagine that everyone within a particular country is inclined to read the same - there are many in Britain, for example, who suffer acute auto- and biographophobia. Ronald Reagan, returning from his tour of South America in 1982 is reported to have said, \"Well, I learned a lot... You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries\", and the same might now be said of what we used to call the United Kingdom. It may seem hard to credit it, but Colin Bateman is a very famous novelist in Northern Ireland, and there are people who regard the Poet Laureate as the greatest living English poet. There are even sub-cultures within sub-cultures. It is of course possible that someone working within a university but outside the Faculty of History might find occasion to consult the new five-volume Oxford History of the British Empire (Oxford University Press, hardback, Â£30 per volume). But who but a handful of die-hards within the English Department will be bothering to read theoretician Stanley Fish's latest, The Trouble with Principle (Harvard University Press, hardback, $24.95)? And for that matter, who but a madman or a judge reads all the books on the Booker Prize shortlist? This is no excuse for complacency. Indeed, for all of these reasons, it is one's duty as a reader to beat one's own pathway through the great felled forests of the world's literature, and to avoid at all costs the easy, recommended routes and the quagmires of the bestseller lists. A bestseller list, after all, measures only so much bulk and wind, and when flicking through the New York or Sunday Times one should always be mindful of the old Russian proverb - shit floats. Publishers and booksellers like to pretend that they know what the public like and what the public want, but the public remains, as the public always was, a phantasm: it is less real, certainly less corporeal, than any one single woman, man or child. On World Book Day, then, pass on by the Waterstone's Recommends and refuse to click on Amazon's Hot 100. Try and forget the big names. Refuse the offerings of the major publishing houses, and disregard the sayings of pundits and reviewers - although, since you asked, I'm currently enjoying Ewen A Whitaker's Mapping and Naming the Moon: A History of Lunar Cartography and Nomenclature (Cambridge University Press, Â£37.50), Eva Crane's The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting (Duckworth, Â£85), Alison J Clarke's Tupperware: The Promise of Plastic in 1950s America (Smithsonian Institute Press, $24.95), Mary F Corey's The World Through a Monocle: the New Yorker at Mid-century (Harvard University Press, $25.95), Antonio Tabbuchi's Declares Pereira (Harvill, Â£5.99), and Moby Dick, by Herman Melville (Penguin Books, Â£1).

John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, said yesterday that the United Kingdom would be in the \"happy position\" of having a huge surplus of credits to trade on the world markets if the government chose to do so. He was launching the government's climate change strategy, which confirmed Britain as the world leader in fighting climate change by delivering on Labour's manifesto pledge of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% for 2010. In doing so, the government will exceed its United Nations legally binding target of 12.5% and, as a world market develops in carbon credits, will be able to sell them to countries unable to meet their own binding pledges. Britain's lead in this area is partly luck, brought about because of Lady Thatcher's hatred of the miners when prime minister, causing a mass switch to gas generation - a far less polluting means of generating electricity. Britain is set to achieve a 15% reduction on 1990 levels this year mainly because of the switch to gas. However, increased economic activity and more traffic growth would have meant the totals rising again, except that policies adopted in the last two years are designed to maintain the downward trend, as it has become clear that climate change is accelerating and is a serious threat. Mr Prescott said yesterday that the UK's strategy went much further than any other country in the world in taking reduction beyond its legally binding target. \"There is no doubt that climate change is the greatest threat to the future of mankind. The floods in China and Mozambique, the damage hurricane Mitch did to central America, they are all symptoms of what we can expect as climate change takes hold. These measures we are putting in place are to save us from the worst effects of global warming.\" The UK's targets would allow the country to take a lead in renewed international negotiations due in the Hague in November; Mr Prescott hoped Europe would ratify the Kyoto protocol that gave binding targets to all countries, and would allow international carbon trading to begin. So far the UK had not decided whether to sell its surplus or keep it \"in the bank\", he said. Estimates vary about how much a ton of carbon will be worth in international trade but it could be as much as Â£15. Britain will have up to 8m tonnes to sell. Among the initiatives announced yesterday were revised energy efficiency targets in homes. From 2002 elderly people and families on low incomes will be helped by electricity and gas suppliers to insulate their homes. There will be an internal UK carbon trading market to encourage businesses to save carbon and sell on credits to other industries. The government has also finalised its climate change levy on industry, which is expected to be the incentive for a cut in emissions of 2.5m tonnes. The government has also given industry notice that hydrochlorofluorocarbons, the successors to chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration, have no long term future and will be phased out, since they too are a powerful global warming gas. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said: \"The 20% cut is only the beginning. Scientists say we must cut 60% to 70% to peg the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to double what it was before the industrial revolution. We must move into renewable energies, fuel cells to drive cars, and other technologies that cause no carbon pollution.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-11T04:03:50Z","webTitle":"The gene genie is out of the bottle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney2","fields":{"headline":"The gene genie is out of the bottle","bodyText":"Leap a little into the future. At the workshop down the road, tiny invisible employees are preparing to clean up a toxic landfill site. Right now, they live peacefully in petri dishes, or in freezer compartments, but some skilled supervisor is about to set the bacteria to work, by scattering them over poisoned soil, to convert toxic wastes into fresh air, water and harmless grit by fermenting them, as if making beer or compost. At the clinic opposite, a patient with diabetes is checking in, to have new implants of genetically compatible islets of Langerhans (small groups of endocrine cells in the pancreas that secrete insulin). It will mean a night's discomfort: but no worries about an insulin crisis for six months or a year. A bit of tissue, grown in a bioreactor precisely for that sufferer, will take care of the problem. Meanwhile, in the farmland at the end of the lane, there is a farmer harvesting plastic flowers. It's not quite as simple as that: actually, he is lifting tubers genetically reprogrammed to convert starches to polymers which can be shipped to factories to provide the feedstock for plastics which can be turned into bags, fibres and - yes, plastic tulips. No problem about unsold harvest: just compost the stuff and plough it back into the soil. Even the plastics are biodegradable, because scientists of the future will have seen to that. This isn't fantasy: all these things are taking shape now. As Britain prepares for National Science Week - 10 days of 7,500 events which will celebrate science, engineering and technology from across the entire kingdom, kicking off on Friday - the managers of science have been looking ahead at the demand for jobs in the science sector. The most dramatic strides are likely to be in biology, biochemistry and biotechnology: if it lives, it can be turned into product, and sold. If it lives, it could manufacture new jobs. Right now, the strange new world of biotechnology in Europe is a small, fragile one - but it is valued at more than Â£30bn. In Britain alone, there are around 450 companies employing 45,000 people in shiny new industries based on clever things to be done with DNA. In a decade, there could be 100,000 new jobs, waiting for new recruits with a background in biology. The horizons widen, say the experts. There are probably 800 small and medium enterprise biotech firms in Europe, probably 1,300 in the US, all of them armed with a little quiver of patented bright ideas that emerged from the laboratory and sped off in search of start-up capital. An industry that was almost unimaginable in the 70s is now growing at 20%, year on year, and threatens to falter for lack of skilled talent. For the 17,000 or so young biologists now completing their first degree each year, things suddenly begin to look bright. But they don't look so bleak for the 75,000 or so other young people with decent science-based degrees, because the revolution in life sciences is going to need many of them: there is a powerful role for computing skills and mathematics in handling and decoding the 100,000 genes now being identified in the 3bn \"letters\" of DNA locked away in every human cell. The same revolutionary tides will break around medicine, dentistry, engineering, chemistry, veterinary sciences and agriculture. \"There are just so many fields that are going to be involved in biology. Everything from engineering individual people in theory, right the way through to the need for increased biological input to forensic science,\" says Dave Phoenix, reader in biochemistry at the university of central Lancashire, and editor of the Journal of Biological Education. \"Your average everyday person is going to be coming across biology-based issues more and more. So you are going to have more and more people being educated to understand them but also more people getting educated to become involved in the generation of future ideas.\" Alan Malcolm, chief executive of the Institute of Biology, agrees. \"It's the subject of the 21st century, without any doubt whatsoever. The discipline has the ability to solve many of the problems that technology has brought us in the 20th century. \"So we have alternatives to chemical fertiliser, alternatives to fossil fuel, the further development of medicines. All these things imply biology, whether it is genetics, pharmaceuticals, the environment, agriculture...\" Britain's biggest industry is food production, he points out. It is three times bigger than pharmaceuticals, three times the size of motorcar production. \"The market biology's in is either guaranteed to stay the same, such as food, or guaranteed to increase as we look at pharmaceutical intervention in the diseases of the 21st century, such as cancer, heart disease and diseases of ageing.\" Much of the pharmaceutical intervention is going to grow out of a new way of understanding both health and disease. The hereditary, single-gene disorder diseases such as Huntington's chorea, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, are already being pursued by small research firms and big academic laboratories. But in the near future, there will be a new understanding of why some people are likely to suffer heart disease, why others are more at risk of cancer, or late onset diabetes, and all of this will be based on a new understanding of the human genome, the string of genes in the 23 chromosomes that make each human unique, and the genomes of old human enemies such as the tuberculosis bacillus, the malaria parasite, or the heliobacter that causes stomach ulcers. According to the UK Bioindustry Association, some are working in what would once have been science-fiction fields such as bioremediation, the use of genetically selected plants or micro-organisms to restore terrain blighted by industry. But many of the new teams of academically qualified entrepreneurs have focused on human health. There's a killing to be made in saving people from death. The biotechnology revolution will change the future more profoundly even than the information technology revolution, according to John Sime, the Bioindustry Association's chief executive officer. \"To find a smarter way to buy a book is one thing, but to find a smarter way to cure Alzheimer's or Parkinson's is an achievement of an altogether different order,\" he says. \"We are on the brink of that. We are making, now, discoveries in biology which when they are turned into products, will meet a huge number of unmet needs. The stuff that is coming out of the human genome project, by itself, is over the next 20 years or so, going to change the way we all live our lives.\" Sure, he says, the Americans are making the running. \"But we have the strength in the science base here, we have the commercialisation potential, we have the clinical trials capability, we have everything we need here to turn the things being found into serious therapies which will earn serious money for the UK and provide a lot of very interesting jobs and im prove the health and welfare of mankind enormously. \"All of that should make for a very interesting career prospect for youngsters. My guess is that before very long we will see a biotech person as well known and probably nearly as rich as Bill Gates.\" He knows the public is worried about GM crops. He doesn't think people are quite so worried about long term risks to human health, though there are questions to be answered about the long-term effect on the countryside and the environment. But the biotechnology revolution could bring benefits to the countryside as well. And GM crops could certainly have benefits for human health. \"The potential in those areas is going to be huge. We are on the brink of - perhaps within 10 years - being able to produce crops with considerably altered nutritional value. I am sure we are going to produce foods which make a contribution to positive health care, things like grains that deliver vitamins and nutrients that are missing from ordinary foods,\" he says. \"There will be all sorts of products on the marketplace to achieve and maintain good health. Some of those will be prescription only, some will be over the counter and some you will buy in your supermarket. All of them will come from biotechnology.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-11T04:03:50Z","webTitle":"Why I chose a genetically modified career in research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/mar/11/features.jobsmoney1","fields":{"headline":"Why I chose a genetically modified career in research","bodyText":"It was a tough decision. Did I follow my musical aspirations or head for a career in science where there appeared to be more opportunities and job stability? I opted for the best of both worlds, with music playing second fiddle to a stimulating career in biotechnology - music definitely refreshes the mind after a frustrating day in the lab. However, while there are a wealth of opportunities and diverse career paths out there for scientists, job instability and a succession of temporary contracts are the reality of academic research. My first taste of \"real\" research came during the fourth year of my biochemistry degree at Oxford. The project was based at the Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Germany, and was a far cry from the previous years' practical classes. I looked at enzymes, the proteins catalysing the chemistry of life, isolated from life-forms popularly known as extremeophiles because they live in some of the most inhospitable parts of the planet such as hot, sulphurous springs. These peculiar proteins function under an astonishing range of temperatures and in chemical conditions that would normally destroy most proteins and render them useless. It was an exciting start, but maybe not the most realistic insight into research as the results flowed fast and furious and in three months I didn't get the chance to become disheartened from the frustrations of repeated experimental failure. I did realise that a high level of self-motivation, an inquisitive mind and good investigative skills would be central to success in science. Contributing good results to the group was exciting and rewarding; I was convinced that a PhD was for me. It was the enthusiastic lecturing of Professors Chris Leaver and Hugh Dickinson that led me to consider an alternative avenue of research: the controversial field of plant genetic engineering. I saw an enormous potential for the power of plant biotechnology and wanted to be part of it. Crops could be genetically modified to grow on soils that would normally be too salty or acidic, a problem for much of the developing world, and plants were being engineered to take up and break down harmful contaminants from the environment, a process called phytoremediation. It was the great diversity of research interests, close collaborations with industry and first-rate facilities that attracted me to the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge. Current projects range from explosive-eating plants, which have the potential to be used in clean-up operations world-wide, to enzyme engineering. In October 1994 I joined Dr Jim Murray's group as a PhD student. We are attempting to understand how plant growth rate is controlled at the molecular level by looking at genes regulating cell division. We showed that plant growth rate can be increased by optimising the levels of naturally occurring plant regulatory proteins. The plants are more competitive and reach maturity more quickly but other characteristics are not disturbed. This could eventually lead to reduced agrochemical inputs due to improved competitiveness of crops over weeds. Life as a researcher is pretty precarious and has its ups and downs. The results are often baffling and it is easy to get demoralised; positions are temporary and the grant application procedure rears its head every few years. But there are numerous opportunities to work abroad in some of the best research institutions: the world is your oyster. There's also the stereotypical image of the boffin in a white lab coat to contend with. Scientists are perceived to be untrustworthy, anti-social and to lack the ability to communicate their research to the public. Working in such a topical area, it is important to be prepared to explain what you do and the wider implications of it in society. To help resolve this image crisis, I am giving a lecture for science week in Cambridge about the merits of the plant kingdom - from the early uses of plants in medicines to a new agricultural age which could see plants becoming the factories of the future. The road of research is not paved with gold, but it is exciting, interesting, challenging and highly rewarding. â¢ Dr Claire Cockcroft is at the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"travel/2000/mar/11/ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-11T18:47:13Z","webTitle":"Where priests may safely leap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/mar/11/ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/mar/11/ireland","fields":{"headline":"Where priests may safely leap","bodyText":"The standard way to County Kerry skirts the coastline of Bantry Bay and forges north past the Caha mountains to Kenmare. It's a spectacular road, zigzagging past coves and inlets with views across the sea to the wild and rugged Beara peninsula. But for something extra special you can turn off the main road just before the end of the bay, following a signpost to Priest's Leap. It's a rough track with grass sprouting in the middle, and after a mile or two it gets steeper so you leave the car and set out on foot. This is the old road into Kerry, and it's a walk that the biographer and novelist Victoria Glendinning returns to nearly every time she visits the west of Ireland: \"It's amazingly romantic because you can feel its history - armies have been up it, sheep have been up, walkers have been up it. The track is quite gentle, but it goes higher and higher, and it's good to see the valley falling away on the left and hills rising on the right towards the Shehy mountains. On a bad day, of course, when the mist is down, you might as well be in Scunthorpe. \"But when the sun comes out and the sky is clear, it's like Greece and everything leaps into colour - the gorse, the heather, the thyme, the flowers. And then you reach the Priest's Leap, where he's meant to have made his jump, and you're suddenly looking down into the Kingdom of Kerry - one refers to it as that because in ancient Ireland it was its own kingdom. \"This is the top of the pass, and the whole of Kerry lies before you - lakes, rivers, valleys, mountains, of such a spectacular nature. And that's the absolute highlight, the whole purpose of the walk. \"You can go further if you want, towards a couple of lakes, but the ground is more tussocky and wet and so the heart fails and the party heads back with soggy feet. And on the way you often meet the farmers driving up in their little old cars, letting out their dogs to herd the sheep down the mountain with amazing skill.\" Glendinning, whose biographies include Swift, Trollope and Edith Sitwell, is an experienced walker who recently followed the Alps on foot from Slovenia to Switzerland with her husband Kevin O'Sullivan. She prefers to have company but likes the way groups of walkers separate and re-form and don't feel obliged to talk all the time. \"I often have very strong ideas about direction, which can be wrong. Kevin is the map reader and carries the compass and is generally the platoon commander. I spend a lot of the time just watching things - it's almost like being asleep, only your eyes are busy the whole time. \"It closes down the rat-race nonsense in your mind. Something chemical seems to happen and you slow down and even out and drop the things which aren't very important.\" The old road to Kerry can be adapted to any length between three and eight miles, depending on the party. Glendinning often thinks about taking picnics, but never gets round to it: \"So we usually end up in the pub eating salmon sandwiches, drinking Guinness and generally feeling pretty good.\" 'It's no coincidence the island's so green' The story of the Priest's Leap dates from 1601, when the armies of Elizabeth I had just defeated Hugh O'Neill and his Spanish allies at the Battle of Kinsale. Father James Archer was trying to rally the clans of Cork and Kerry into continuing resistance to the occupying forces. One day, English troops spotted him on the old road to Kerry and gave chase. \"It's at this point that the story, like so many ancient stories in Ireland, takes a leap of its own into myth,\" says Jim MacDonald, who organises walking holidays in Kerry. \"From the rock at the pass, Father Archer jumped his horse away to safety in Bantry town, several miles away.\" MacDonald, who started Irish Ways 11 years ago, says Kerry is an ideal walking area, being wild, quiet and close to the sea. \"But you have to know your map and compass,\" he says. \"There aren't many paths and the weather changes fast. It's not by coincidence that the island is so green, and you can expect a drenching at some point. But it's likely to be followed by beautiful sunshine, and it's this ever-changing light and clarity of vision which makes it so special.\" There are now 31 waymarked ways in Ireland, most of them circular like the Kerry Way, with a total length of 1,900 miles.

Suddenly you notice a large figure in uniform behind you. Distracted, you mistype your PIN number. The machine demands you type it again, so you do - and collect your money. Then the figure puts his hand on your shoulder and you discover he's a policeman. A large, unfriendly policeman. He says he has reason to suspect you are up to no good and demands that you tell him your PIN number. You refuse or, in the confusion, you can't remember it. Before you know what's happening you've been arrested and are standing before a judge. The charge? Failing to disclose your PIN number to a duly authorised person. The fact that you cannot remember it is no defence. It is assumed that you were up to no good - unless you can prove to the contrary. You are sent down for two years. Unbelievable? Couldn't happen in a liberal democracy? Well, I have news for you. Last week Jack Straw, New Labour's avuncular Interior Minister, introduced a Bill into the Commons which aims to create an analogous situation in relation to data encryption. A PIN number is analogous to a cryptographic key such as you might use to protect your email - or confidential files on your hard disk - from prying eyes. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill gives Mr Straw the power to demand you decrypt data on demand. Failing to provide the key will be a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, and carries with it the presumption of guilt. You must somehow prove you do not have the key. That you may have mislaid or forgotten it will not be a defence. And if, having suffered a miscarriage of justice under this statute, you decide to complain in public, 'Liberal Jack' has another ace up his sleeve - you can be sent down for a further five years! Meanwhile, paedophiles and criminals, who really do have appalling stuff on their disks and in their emails, will keep their mouths shut and take the two years for refusing to decrypt on demand. After all, it's a better deal than doing five to 10 years for a really serious offence. There is more. The Bill requires UK Internet Service Providers to install systems which will allow Secretary Straw and his duly authorised goons to track subscribers' communications traffic. That means every email you send - and every reply you receive, plus information on every website you've visited, every book you've bought from Amazon, every air-ticket you've purchased, every piece of software you've ever downloaded. And if you have encrypted your communications - well, see the last paragraph, but one above. On what grounds might the Interior Ministry justify such an invasion of your privacy? Here's a list from Section 20 of the Bill: national security (not defined, of course); preventing or detecting crime; preventing disorder; public safety; protecting public health. Oh, and Mr Straw can lawfully authorise electronic snooping 'in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom'. Imagine how that last justification will play with foreign businesses wondering whether to set up in e-commerce in the UK. And then ponder the fact that the official line is to make the UK the most e-friendly state in Europe by 2002. Joined-up government, my eye. Meanwhile, the Irish government is legislating to make it illegal even for it to snoop on Internet traffic, so if this Bill makes it to the Statute book we can all move to Irish ISPs.

First, the wildlife bill delivered almost everything the environmentalists had wanted on protecting wild animals as well as, after 65 years of campaigning, the right to roam. Last week the government came up trumps on climate change; fears that New Labour would renege on its manifesto commitment to a 20% cut in carbon dioxide by 2010 proved groundless. The United Kingdom can now rightly claim to be a world leader in cutting carbon emissions, and John Prescott will play a key role in the Hague in November in developing the international architecture needed to implement the targets agreed at Kyoto. What is more, environment minister Michael Meacher made it clear that this is just an instalment towards the target of 60-70% cuts by 2050. Of course, environmentalists still have gripes. They complain the government has failed to grasp the nettle on transport; traffic figures continue rising. They want changes in the planning system to match a Danish-style push for the adoption of wind power. But in the big picture, after a long wait, New Labour has finally begun to deliver on the environment. What lies behind this shift has been increasing awareness on the part of business of the environment's importance. Industry has begun to spot the silver lining to the clouds around Gordon Brown's climate change levy: the opportunity to save money on energy conservation and eventually even make money by trading carbon emissions quotas. Set against these advances, the official position on the Ilisu dam project in southern Turkey looks even more indefensible - as the trade and industry select committee argued strongly last week. The government has double standards: a green agenda at home that seems irrelevant to British companies when they operate abroad. Preventing this kind of policy incoherence was the rationale behind the government's bid to \"join up\". Nowhere is consistency more needed now than in Stephen Byers' decision whether the export credit guarantee department (ECGD) should offer Balfour Beatty Â£200m to underwrite the massively controversial scheme; in December the trade secretary had said he was minded to back it. The select committee said that lack of consultation and displacement of thousands of Kurds were big concerns, but it was also alarmed at the lack of international consultation with Syria and Iraq, countries down river of Ilisu. What particularly irked the MPs was the \"deplorable and counter-productive lack of transparency\" around the project. Their report is crucial evidence in the case against the ECGD. It portrays a department which operates on principles which bear no relation to the objectives of the rest of the government, whether on the environment or for the sake of an ethical foreign policy. The MPs warn the department of trade and industry to take seriously its responsibilities to promote human rights and sustainable development rather than leaving them to other departments. It must not always give priority to commercial considerations. This would amount to a significant change in the culture of the two Whitehall departments which under the Tories became standard bearers for uncritically pro-business Thatcherism. Mr Byers has to make sure his civil servants get the message. The government's credibility on the environment does not rest on the department of that name alone. Ilisu is fast becoming the litmus test of New Labour's ability to put principles before its promotion of business interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2000/mar/14/futureofthenhs.health","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-14T09:23:55Z","webTitle":"Heart surgery down because of bed shortage, surgeon says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/mar/14/futureofthenhs.health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/mar/14/futureofthenhs.health","fields":{"headline":"Heart surgery down because of bed shortage, surgeon says","bodyText":"The number of heart operations carried out in Britain fell last year for the first time in 25 years because of a shortage of intensive care beds, a leading surgeon said today. \"It's intensely depressing having to cancel an open heart operation, when you have the patient waiting in the hospital, simply because you don't have the recovery beds,\" Jules Dussek, the head of the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Dussek said that, according to the society's research, the United Kingdom came bottom in Europe in terms of the number of heart operations performed compared with those needed. \"There is a risk of dying when waiting for that sort of operation,\" he said. Mr Dussek said that according to figures compiled by the UK's Cardiac Surgical Register, the number of heart bypass operations fell by around 600 last year to 25,083. Department of health figures show that heart operations in England - excluding Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - increased to 23,663 from 22,181 in 1999. However, Mr Dussek said he was confident his figures were correct. \"We collected them from every single unit in the UK and we also collect them from every single surgeon. \"We also phoned round all the units in England a couple of weeks ago and found they were doing 20% to 25% less work that day than they aimed to do.\" Surgeons and other staff were \"twiddling their thumbs\" because there was a desperate shortage of intensive care beds for patients after surgery, he added. Health secretary Alan Milburn launched a Â£50m \"crusade\" against coronary heart disease this month and unveiled plans to cut heart deaths by 40% by 2010. The plan includes the creation of 100 \"rapid reaction\" chest pain clinics across the country by 2002 to guarantee patients an appointment with a specialist within two weeks of seeing their GP. Mr Dussek welcomed the plan and said the number of heart operations carried out in 2000 could increase by 2,000 to 3,000 due to extra government funding and initiatives, though he cautioned that the government measures amounted to only a \"drop in the ocean\". He also said that the government's target of reducing death from heart disease by 40% by 2010 was optimistic. Coronary heart disease kills one in four men and one in five women in Britain, one of the highest death rates in the world. About 1.4m people in the country suffer from the disease."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/mar/14/news1","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-14T11:48:16Z","webTitle":"Today's other news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/14/news1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/mar/14/news1","fields":{"headline":"Today's other news","bodyText":"â¢ Director Michael Winterbottom is determined to use a genuine human corpse in his new picture, Kingdom Come, currently filming in rural Canada.

Her albums, which include a large number of her own compositions, provided a developmental course for children of all ages. Such was the success of the Modern Piano Course for children that she was encouraged to write The Adult Beginner. The pieces selected were chosen to give the beginner keyboard freedom; they were original, and fun to play. Kirkby-Mason studied at the Royal Academy of Music in the 1920s and won medals, in particular, the Stemdale Bennett prize for her playing of Mozart. Later, she studied under the great Bach pianist, Harold Samuel, and her earliest published compositions date from 1931. She gave a solo debut recital on BBC radio in 1934 and would have developed her career as a concert pianist had she not married in 1940 and started a family. Her husband, Kenneth Lambert, was at that time a clergyman, but later became an eminent analytical psychologist. Although Kirkby-Mason continued to give recitals, they became secondary to her work as a composer, lec turer and adjudicator. Apart from educational compositions, she continued general composition to a concert standard. Her piece, Fantasy-Rondo For Guitar, received its premiere at London's Wigmore Hall in 1986. Between 1931 and 1983, she had more than 70 piano publications. Her work as a lecturer involved tours of the United Kingdom in the 1950s and, later, extensive travel all over the world. However, her professional success was clouded by unhappiness when she was divorced in 1965 after 25 years of marriage. The popularity of Kirkby-Mason's lectures and tutors were testament to her ability to communicate musical concepts stripped of academic jargon, combined with her sense of fun. Titles of her pieces such as The Hobby Horse, Catch Me If You Can, A Fairy Lullaby and Happy Song, from the earliest piano album, are typical examples. She made few concessions to age, continuing to lecture and teach into her 80s. She later wrote a book on the theory of piano playing and performance and was looking for a publisher when, in December 1996, she had a severe stroke. She is survived by her two sons.

But after a low key welcome in Canberra she was given a friendly reminder that while the republicans are down they are not out. Her tour - her first in Australia for eight years - began like clockwork when a Royal Australian Air Force VIP jet landed in a warm autumn evening at the Fairbairn base after collecting the monarch and her entourage of 32 from her chartered Qantas 747 in Sydney. The Queen was met on the tarmac by the governor general, Sir William Deane, the Australian prime minister, John Howard, and their wives. There was no red carpet, no national anthem, no military guard of honour, no 21-gun salute. While a few royal well-wishers lined the route between the airport and the governor general's official residence of Yarralumla, the local branch of the Australian Republican Movement stole their thunder with a large yellow and gold banner reading \"The Republic of the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] welcomes the Queen of England\". An ARM spokesman, Robin Poke, said he wanted to remind the Queen that the struggle for a republic continued. The singing of God Save the Queen by a handful of royalists outside the gates of Yarralumla sounded a little hollow as the royal Rolls-Royce sped into the vice-regal sanctuary to give the Queen a quiet weekend to get over jet lag. Prince Philip did not fly in from London with the party but arrived later in Canberra from the United States. However, there was one bright spot for traditionalists. Janette Howard, wife of the prime minister, an avowed republican, curtseyed to the Queen. It was a small but significant sign of how things have changed at the top. The last time the Queen arrived in 1992, Annita Keating, wife of the then prime minister, Paul Keating, refused to curtsey in what some tried to make out was a calculated republican snub. Despite the divisions caused by the republic debate, which was defeated by 45% to 55%, the royal tour does not so far appear to have stirred great passions from either side. While the Queen's every move and word are likely to be scrutinised on the busy itinerary, which does not take in Queensland or South Australia, few pundits are predicting much of a turn out, at least in the cities. The Queen's first official appointment of her 13th tour of Australia is a meeting with Mr Howard today at Yarralumla while her first public appearance will be at a church service tomorrow. The initial test of public support for the royal tour will be seen on Monday, when the Queen will receive a 21-gun salute at the official welcoming ceremony at the Sydney opera house. The ceremonies will be complete with a traditional greeting from local aboriginal people. The Queen will spend another day in Sydney visiting the Olympic site before joining the duke to tour the outback town of Bourke, which in recent years has been stigmatised for its poor relations between blacks and whites and for its law and order problems. Next week will be rounded off with two days in Melbourne and in rural Ballarat. After another relaxed weekend in Canberra, the final week will include two days in Tasmania and a whistlestop tour through Alice Springs and Perth before returning to Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/mar/18/emu.theeuro","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-18T03:33:11Z","webTitle":"Top Tories' secret plot to quit EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/mar/18/emu.theeuro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/mar/18/emu.theeuro","fields":{"headline":"Top Tories' secret plot to quit EU","bodyText":"A secret plot has been hatched by senior Conservatives to prepare the ground for British withdrawal from the European Union, raising new doubts about William Hague's ability to hold his party together over Europe. A group of Eurosceptic Tory frontbenchers, who are determined to undermine Britain's place in Europe, have played a leading role in persuading a powerful United States senate committee to investigate the possibility of Britain unilaterally joining the North America free trade area. Such a move would lead to instant expulsion from the EU. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, last night seized on the secret plan to claim that the Conservatives' policy of \"withdrawal by stealth\" had at last been exposed. Mr Cook said: \"William Hague's cover has been blown. Nobody can now take seriously his protestations that he wants Britain to remain in the EU when he he is secretly working to get Britain to join Nafta.\" The foreign secretary hit out when it emerged that the US senate's finance committee launched an investigation into possible British membership of Nafta after intense lobbying from a group of senior Tory Eurosceptics. These include John Redwood, who said yesterday that he received a \"warm reception\" in Washington last year while he was a member of the shadow cabinet. The group also included Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, and the rightwing backbencher Eric Forth, who is a close ally of the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo. Mr Redwood said that a series of trips to Washington by leading Tories had played an important role in persuading the senate committee to commission its investigation into British membership. \"There is growing opposition to a fortress Europe in the United States,\" Mr Redwood said. \"If low tariffs make sense in Europe why can't they make sense across the Atlantic?\" The Conservatives last night angrily rejected Mr Cook's claims that Mr Hague was behind a plot to use Nafta membership to force Britain out of the EU. A spokesman for Mr Hague said: \"We believe that Britain should join Nafta but this should be done through the European Union. To claim that we are pushing for Britain to join Nafta unilaterally is a Millbank lie.\" The row between the foreign secretary and the Tories broke out after a team of officials from the US international trade commission, which is carrying out the Nafta investigation on behalf of the senate finance committee, arrived in London this week to launch their investigation. The Americans are meeting Eurosceptic groups such as the anti-single currency group Business for Sterling. Pro-Europeans believe that the Eurosceptic Tories have succeeded in pushing forward their \"withdrawal agenda\" by persuading the US senate that Britain could make a unilateral decision to join Nafta. The US commission's terms of reference talk about British membership of the North American free trade area, without making any reference to the EU. They talk of investigating \"the impact on the US economy of including the United Kingdom in a free trade arrangement\". Foreign office officials will tell US commission officials, when they meet next week, that a unilateral move is impossible because Britain can only set up trade deals through the EU. One source said: \"Our officials will stress the constitutional impossibility of Britain joining Nafta without leaving the EU.\" This was reinforced by Mr Cook. \"The fact is that that the overwhelming majority of our exports [52.7%] go to countries of the EU, while only 17% of our trade is with Nafta,\" the foreign secretary said. \"This shows that William Hague is prepared to jeopardise a very large number of British jobs for the sake of satisfying his party's extreme anti-European prejudices.\" Despite the Tories' dismissal of Mr Cook's claims, the disclosure of the role of senior Conservatives in the Nafta investigation will once again focus attention on Mr Hague's commitment to Europe. At last year's Tory conference, the party leader raised the possibility of a future Conservative government renegotiating Britain's European treaties, which was seen as code for withdrawal. Mr Hague's lurch towards extreme Euroscepticism was largely put down to pressure from Lady Thatcher, who hijacked the conference when she declared that all Britain's problems had come from the continent. The former prime minister underlined her contempt for the European Union yesterday by publicly supporting the rightwing peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch when he introduced a bill that would lay the ground for British withdrawal from the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/mar/19/featuresreview.review3","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-19T00:07:37Z","webTitle":"Work out with Debussy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/mar/19/featuresreview.review3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/mar/19/featuresreview.review3","fields":{"headline":"Work out with Debussy","bodyText":"PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande Castle Vale Leisure Centre, Birmingham Forward Festival Symphony Hall, Birmingham/Radio 3 You walk into a drab-looking school gym in the middle of a Birmingham housing estate. Two hours later you emerge enriched by a rare operatic experience. A likely story? It should really be no matter for surprise. City of Birmingham Touring Opera has been doing this sort of thing for 13 years. Each time they assert that, in its musical activities, Britain's second city is rather better at reaching out (not just the token 'outreach' or, even worse, 'access') than its first. This small-scale company, which won attention with its pocket-sized version of The Ring, manages to thrive on tough challenges and bare necessities. Of all operas, PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande had seemed an unlikely contender for the leisure centre treatment. This most subtle, sensuous and elusive of scores relies for effect on the finesse of Debussy's orchestration, or so it had always appeared. Yet the moment the hall darkened and, in a skilful and effective arrangement by Marius Constant, the two pianos struck up the obscurely disquieting prelude, you knew Debussy would be well served. Even the brief cooing of a baby in the audience only heightened the atmosphere. This sharply focused staging, by Franco Ripa di Meana, based on a shortened adaptation by Peter Brook, drove home the unavoidable truth that a few strong ideas well performed will always work, just as all the lavish sets and costumes in the world can never plaster a hole left by weak imagination. The almost circular stage, like a horizontal slice of eclipsed moon, rose and fell in sections (perhaps once too often). Characters appeared mysteriously, watching and waiting by stealth. The only props here were several large lumps of coal, giving weight to the vague impression that Maeterlinck's imaginary kingdom of Allemonde, with its castle and cave and forest, had here become a mine shaft with, as its covetous owner, the old, half-blind King Arkel, head of one of opera's more dysfunctional families (no mean feat considering the competition). Even if that reading is too literal, the dank sense of oppression it inspired cast an uneasy spell, only broken when an arc of brilliant green light - the pool around which the adulterous lovers play - interrupted the blackness. Hugh Macdonald's translation was clear and audible. Felicity Hammond, despite a heavy cold, had an appropriately febrile nerviness as MÃ©lisande, with Karl Daymond, not quite in best voice but a strong stage presence, as her strangely disconnected lover. Christopher Purves conveyed the black sense of hurt felt by Golaud and sang with expressive potency. The two pianists, Steven Maughan and CBTO's music director Jonathan Hinden, convinced you that Debussy had always intended his music this way. In great works the heat is at the centre not on the surface and always shines out. We certainly heard as much of Debussy as Proust did when he listened to the first performance on the telephone. There are two more performances, in Wakefield tomorrow and at Snape Maltings this Saturday. Olivier Messiaen first encountered PellÃ©as in 1918 when he was 10 years old. It left a lasting impression and his own music took root in that same anti-symphonic tradition. Those of us ineluctably drawn to Birmingham again on Wednesday had the chance to hear Messiaen's monolithic last summation, Ã©clairs sur l'au-delÃ  , first performed just after his death in 1992. This 11-movement contemplation, played by a vast orchestra, displays Messiaen at his most refined and most spectacular. In the ninth 'Birds of the Trees of Life' section, an astonishing trilling and twittering of eight clarinets, seven flutes and three piccolos bursts forth, by some elaborate calculation managing to play the songs of 25 different birds. Who will forget the mesmerising sight of Simon Rattle, back with his old team, furiously and emphatically wagging a different number of fingers to mark each new entry? Paired with this twentieth-century masterpiece was a composition written this century (following the intention of the Forward Festival), commissioned by the orchestra from one of its regular collaborators, Judith Weir. Her large-scale choral work We Are Shadows, as its title suggests, reflects on the impermanence of life, using texts from Scottish graveyard inscriptions, Taoist philosophy and a poem by Emily Dickinson. The exotic mix of bamboo chimes, roto toms and a variety of bells and cymbals, reflecting Weir's acknowledged debt to 'cheerful' Buddhist funeral music, would have appealed to Messiaen, and made an apt contrast to Ã©clairs. In this aurally ingenious score, full of dry-bone rattles and whispers, the sound of all the string players tapping their fingers rapidly on the wood of their instruments, swirling up through the orchestra like a chill wind through trees and echoed elsewhere by flurries of ascending scales, was an especially brilliant touch. The excellently drilled treble voices of the City of Birmingham Symphony Youth Chorus, aged from eight to 12 and performing from memory, sang out the long, overarching lines with evident relish. So too did their senior partners, the CBSO's Symphony Chorus. There is a second chance tomorrow when the Festival Hall will be filled with these communions with nature and beyond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/mar/19/historybooks.kevintoolis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-19T00:09:04Z","webTitle":"The only Gaels in the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/19/historybooks.kevintoolis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/mar/19/historybooks.kevintoolis","fields":{"headline":"The only Gaels in the world","bodyText":"Hungry for Home Cole Merton Viking Â£14.99, pp288 Buy it at BOL On Christmas Eve 1946, a young man collapsed and died of meningitis on a remote island off the west coast of Ireland. It was the beginning of the end for the famed Blasket Islands beloved of Gaelic poets and playwright John Millington Synge, who modelled his heroine of The Playboy of the Western World on an island character. Generations of literary romantics may have come to sup at what they perceived to be a Homeric Gaelic fount of simplicity and rugged human endurance, but for the hapless islanders the death of SeÃ¡nÃ­n Ã Cearna was the final straw in a pitiless battle against the raging elements. On the edge of the world, the Blaskets were devoid of almost every human necessity; Ã Cearna's pallbearers had to risk their own lives in the face of a howling storm to row to the mainland to obtain his coffin. Within a few years, they had abandoned their island, their culture, their home, for perpetual exile. The move to the mainland in 1953 signalled the fall of the last real indigenous Gaelic community. It was the end of the powerful but pernicious dream of an Ireland Gaelic and free. Myth is never far away from the Blaskets but the real story of death of the islands would be unknown but for the efforts of Cole Moreton in Hungry for Home, who stunningly catalogues its final days and seeks out the testimony of remaining survivors in Ireland and the suburbs of Springfield, Massachusetts. Moreton, who wonderfully is neither Irish or American, but an intriguing seeker after truth, delves deeply into the rich river of the Irish diaspora. The Michael Collinses and the Gerry Adamses come and go but the story of the diaspora is, rather than the easy myths of the bold Fenian men, the story of the Irish. The fall of the Blasket Islands is emblematic of that far greater Irish chronicle of human sorrow, exile and transformation. In Cobh harbour, Moreton strolls around the leprechaun-bestrewn shops of the 'Harbour of Tears', the gateway through which three million Irish fled westward for generation after generation. It is still an unimaginable number when you consider that the current population of the Republic is just four million. Rarely in human history can one country have so relentlessly bled and bled its young. The reasons are not far to find. Across the sound from the Blasket Islands on the Dingle peninsula, Moreton visits two brothers, islandmen SeÃ¡n and Muiris, still cooking on an open fire in a new millennium after refusing that new-fangled electricity, their lives run to nowhere by poverty and sterile loneliness. At night, the brothers - the round of their little world complete - fly the darkness for the local pub and furtive glances at dreary RTE on the bar television. The best escape but only at a price. In Springfield, Massachusetts, Moreton finds SeÃ¡nÃ­n Ã Cearna's brother MÃ­cheÃ¡l to have traded identity and poverty for a 27-inch television in the sitting-room and a 19-inch one in the bedroom. 'So we have come a long way,' expounds Mike Carney, after a lifetime spent vacantly fulfilling the American immigrant dream. Carney takes Moreton on a tour of his new kingdom, the nearby ugly barn of an Irish club where the working-class Irish immigrants comfort themselves with dreams of the past even as their children slip away into the mainstream and the old neighbourhood is taken over by new despised Puerto Rican immigrants. Moreton plays lightly with it but he is quite sharp enough not to be seduced by the cheery self-myths of those who leap from victim to racist in just one generation. Moreton listens hard - these are not cultures easily penetrable by the written word because they lack self-consciousness - and teases out the unrequited longing beneath the glib stories. In abandonment, the Blasket Islands are difficult to reach today. It took Moreton two summers before he stood in the ruins where the long-lost Ã Cearnas had played out their island lives. What he found there was not comforting, the detritus of an inescapably dead past. Hungry for Home is a fine book by a gifted writer, though its conclusions are inescapable. There is no road of return for the exile, no possible life, nothing to return to. We leave home and are transformed forever. But that knowledge does not kill the hunger we carry around in our hearts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2000/mar/21/1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-21T18:09:30Z","webTitle":"The Budget speech - part two","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/mar/21/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/mar/21/1","fields":{"headline":"The Budget speech - part two","bodyText":"Yesterday in response to the Cruickshank Report, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary for Trade and I referred small business banking to the Competition Commission. Mr Cruickshank estimates that competition can reduce banking costs and charges by up to 10 per cent or 3 - 5 billion pounds a year. The money transmission system affects every cheque, every credit card and every debit transaction and reaches from every local cash dispenser to every corporate inter-bank transfer. Today I am announcing that we will legislate to ensure the UK payments system is open to new competition. The international competitiveness of the bond market in the City of London depends upon a level playing field. That is why today I am announcing the abolition from April 2001 of the withholding tax on the interest paid on international bonds. We will legislate so we can proceed on the basis of exchange of information nationally and internationally. This change should be widely welcomed in all parts of the house. There is no clearer indication of our determination to stand up for what is right for Britain. Since 1997 the number of small businesses in Britain has risen from 1.2 million to 1.3 million - a 100,000 increase. Today I continue to remove the old barriers to small business growth. Having already cut small business corporation tax from 23 per cent to 20 per cent and, for the first 10,000 pounds of their profits, to just 10 per cent, I am today making a further tax reduction. For all small and medium sized businesses the 40 per cent capital allowances - which I introduced in my 1997 Budget - will be made permanent. This will be of special help to manufacturing companies. Half manufacturing employment is in small and medium sized firms. So manufacturing will derive further benefit from the 150 million pounds I am allocating to our new research and development tax credit, introduced on 6th April, to finance 30 per cent of their R and D costs. I want to make Britain the best environment for e-commerce and catch up with America as swiftly as possible. To encourage one million small companies to go on line, I will introduce a special tax reduction. For the next three years any small business buying computers, or investing in e commerce and new information technology, will be able to immediately write off against tax the full 100 per cent of the cost in the year of purchase. Side by side with this incentive, the small business service will offer consultancy, advice and planning to help small businesses get on line and become e-companies, and with the additional resources the Secretary for Employment is providing the University for Industry, which starts this Autumn, will offer small business employees training on the Internet We are determined to lead in e-commerce and the Internet. Today we are introducing new rules for work permits in areas of highly skilled information technology where there is a global shortage. And to promote the use of the Internet we will legislate for other tax cuts - a 100 pounds tax cut for electronic filing of tax and VAT returns, and a further 50 pounds tax cut for electronic filing for those paying the working families tax credit. Tax cuts since 1997 are worth one billion pounds a year for small businesses alone. After today's measures, Britain now has the lowest small business corporation taxes we have ever had, the lowest in the industrialised world: since 1997, for small companies an average tax cut of almost 25 per cent. And to encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs, we are forming a partnership with the CBI, the Institute of Directors and the Chambers of Commerce to encourage enterprise in all communities. Two new enterprise funds will target business loans and management scholarships to high unemployment areas. Stage by stage we are moving from the Britain where enterprise was a closed circle for the few, to a Britain where enterprise will be open to all. We must also remove the old barriers of under-investment and neglect that for too long have held our regions back. Working with the new Regional Development Agencies and the Small Business Service, our aim is balanced economic development across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom - a modern regional policy supporting local innovation, more investment and improved infrastructure. To finance a network of regional venture capital investment funds, we are today announcing a partnership with the European Investment Bank and the private sector - with a target of one billion pounds for new economic development for our regions and nations. The regional targets will be 85 million for the South West, 120 million for the North West, 130 million for the North East and Yorkshire, 250 million for the Midlands and East, 250 million for London and the South East. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have their own funds. To further promote a modern regional policy, the Secretary for Industry will be announcing a regional innovation fund to facilitate the formation of local clusters in hi tech industries. For years Britain, as a whole, has lagged behind America in business access to venture capital investment. Here only half as much is invested per head. I am grateful to Mr Paul Myners, who has agreed to head a review of institutional investment, to report to me in time for the next Budget. Our goal for the whole of the United Kingdom is to remove the old barriers to full employment. We know that greater opportunity for all means greater prosperity for all. Since 1997 the number of unemployed on benefits has fallen by 30 per cent. Youth unemployment is down 70 per cent and nearly 200,000 more young people have now found jobs. Long term youth unemployment, which in the mid-eighties was at 500,000 and even in 1997 was as high as 200,000, is already down to 50,000. The New Deal demonstrates how false was the old choice between enterprise and fairness, between efficiency and equality. By delivering employment opportunity for all, we are making Britain both more enterprising and more fair, to the benefit not just of the high unemployment areas but the whole country. And because we have succeeded in this Parliament in removing the old barriers to employing the young, I can announce that starting from April next year we will extend the opportunities and the obligations of the New Deal to the long term adult unemployed - with four options of: work, work-based training, work experience including in the voluntary sector, self-employment. But no fifth option, no staying at home on benefit doing nothing. The relationship we are forging between rights and responsibilities is firmly rooted in both economic opportunity and individual responsibility. Instead of being left to draw benefit at a social security office, the unemployed who are able to work will sign up to seek work, with the long term unemployed offered the help of a personal employment adviser. To ease the transition back to work, the Government will introduce a new job grant for long term unemployed starting at 100 pounds and help with rent or mortgage. Instead of benefits paying more than work, work will now pay. And I can announce that we will extend the principle of the working families tax credit. As a first stage, from 1st April, all long term unemployed over 50 who want to return to work will be guaranteed a minimum income for their first year back - for wages up to 15,000 pounds a year, an extra payment of 60 pounds a week. And building on the forthcoming rise in the national minimum wage, I am today increasing the working families tax credit. It is already being paid to one million families in our country. And with today's family tax cut, the minimum family income will rise next April - from 200 pounds a week by 7 per cent to 214 pounds a week. Full employment is not just about the right to work, but, where there are jobs, the responsibility and the requirement to work. We will implement the Report of Lord Grabiner QC. Starting in May, a confidential phone line will advise claimants on how to move from the hidden economy and end fraudulent benefit or tax claims; how to get work, register as a business, or become self employed. After six months, from 1 January, for those who fail to respond, tougher rules and penalties will be imposed. From October, in the 20 highest unemployment areas of Britain covering 127,000 unemployed, local special action teams will be set up to help local unemployed people into nearby vacancies. The number of lone parents on income support has fallen by almost 100,000 since 1997. But the employment rate among lone parents in Britain is still only 45 per cent, far below the 70-80 per cent rates of America, France and Scandinavia. In this Budget we remove old barriers to work and I can today announce an extension of the New Deal in a new way to half a million lone parents. Piloted from this Autumn, and starting nationally from next April, lone parents with children over five will be invited to work-focussed interviews - and encouraged to take up new choices: - the choice to train for work with a new cash payment of 15 pounds a week on top of benefits; - the choice of a few hours work a week, with the first 20 pounds of earnings allowed with no reduction in benefit; - the choice of part time work with a guaranteed 155 pounds for 16 hours or the choice of full time work on a guaranteed 214 pounds a week; - and on every rung of this ladder of opportunity, help with back-to-work costs and with child care. Just as we remove old barriers to lone parents working when their children go to school, so too we will help mothers who want to be at home in the first months of their child's life. Today, too many children are born into poverty because the family income drops when the mother stops work. Yet this is the time when many mothers feel they need to be at home with their young child. The Secretary for Trade is announcing that he will review what improvements can be made in maternity pay and parental leave to improve family friendly employment. But today I can announce immediate decisions which recognise the extra costs families face when a child is born. For all low income mothers who meet the basic requirement of health check ups for their young child, we will increase the Sure-Start maternity grant from 200 to 300 pounds. Helping over 200,000 low income mothers. Mothers on paid maternity leave who would otherwise fall into income support will now stay on working families tax credit. Families receiving the credit where the mother wants to stay at home will no longer have to wait as long as six months for additional support after a child is born - this will be worth up to 30 pounds a week. I have examined the alternative put to me of a transferrable tax allowance for husbands and wives when mothers stay at home. Under this system, a family with two children on 15,000 pounds a year would receive 965 pounds a year. The working families tax credit is far better. With the improvements in it announced today the same couple will receive not 965 pounds a year but 2,200 pounds a year. The Prime Minister has set a national goal for our country - to abolish child poverty in 20 years, and to halve it by 2010. A Sure Start for all Britain's children is not only right but the best anti-crime, the best anti-drugs, the best anti-unemployment and the best anti-dependency policy for this country's future. And our strategy starts from the foundation of universal child benefit for all seven million families with children. When we came to office, child benefit was just 11 pounds five pence for the first child. Child benefit will be 15 pounds fifty pence from April 2001, 40 per cent more than in 1997. For young children in the poorest families, weekly support in 1997 was just 28 pounds. We have raised it in every Budget and today the Secretary for Social Security is announcing a further increase for the poorest children of four pounds 35 pence a week. So maximum support is up from the 28 pounds of 1997 to up to 50 pounds a week next year. As a result of all our measures, the poorest two child family on income support will now be 1,500 pounds a year better off than in 1997. And the low paid family with two children on a wage of 10,000 pounds a year will now be 2,700 pounds a year better off. This is what we mean by tackling child poverty while making work pay. I can now report that the numbers of children lifted out of poverty will this year rise beyond one million, and next year reach 1.2 million children - the greatest reduction in child poverty in 50 years, our country now at last fulfilling this generation's obligations to the next. And as we move forward to take the second million children out of poverty, I can confirm today that the Secretary for Social Security and I have agreed on the next major reform. Over the next three years, building on the foundation of universal child benefit, we will create an integrated and seamless system of support for children paid to the mother. The war against child poverty needs more than finance and more than the efforts of government acting alone. The war against child poverty can only be won by the combined efforts of private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together. I can confirm that after consultation with charities and voluntary organisations we will proceed to set up, in every region of our country, and with new cash allocated in our spending review, not just one children's fund but a network of local and regional children's funds to support work by the voluntary sector in meeting the needs of children.

Today, I can report that in 1999, instead of the recession that many forecast, the British economy grew by 2 per cent. And Britain has been growing steadily while meeting our inflation target. Today inflation is 2.2 per cent. For the third year running inflation is in line with our target. And the target of 2.5 per cent - which I reaffirm - will be met this year, next year and the year after that. Because of the action we took in 1997 to stop inflation getting out of control, inflation in Britain has now been lower for longer than at any time since the 1960s. For almost thirty years, Britain's long term interest rates were, on average, 3 per cent higher than Germany's. Now British long term rates are down to the levels in Germany and today lower than in the USA. Amid the risks of an uncertain and often unstable global economy, we are determined to maintain our disciplined approach: determined not to make the old British mistakes of paying ourselves too much today at the cost of higher interest rates and fewer jobs tomorrow, determined not to make the old mistake of putting consumption before investment, the short term before the long term. Britain does not want a return to boom and bust. That is why the Bank of England has been right to take pre-emptive action on interest rates and to be vigilant on wage inflation. It is because the foundations on which we build are strong that the economy can meet our inflation target and achieve steady growth. Our forecast is that growth this year will rise to 2.75-3.25 per cent, and next year and the year after it is forecast to be 2.25 to 2.75 per cent - in line with our view of trend growth. Manufacturing is growing by 1.75 to 2.25 per cent this year and next. And business investment grew by 7.7 per cent last year to 14.5 per cent of national income, with Britain since 1998 for the first time investing more of our national income than our major European competitors, and more than America. This Budget is built on the realities of this new economy - that we will meet and master a new tide of unprecedented technological change by continuing to remove the old barriers to business investment and by continuing to expand employment opportunity for hard working families. I can report that unemployment today is at its lowest for 20 years, that there are 800,000 more people in work since 1997 and that there are one million vacancies on offer. Take-home pay is rising - by next year, for the typical family, a real terms rise in living standards of 10 per cent since 1997. Britain's economic success depends not only on monetary stability but on fiscal stability. Today, I can report that because of tough decisions to cut the deficit in our first two years and lower long term interest rates, debt interest payments will be four billion pounds a year lower. Because of the Welfare to Work reforms that have cut unemployment, social security spending on economic failure this year is a total of 3 billions less than the plans we inherited. Today, Mr Deputy Speaker, the state of the public finances is sound. In 1997 we inherited a current deficit exceeding 20 billion pounds. A year ago I estimated that this year's current surplus would be 2.5 billion pounds. I can report that we have not only balanced the current Budget but our current surplus this year is forecast to be 17 billion pounds. We have met and we will continue to meet, even on the most cautious of cases, our first rule of fiscal prudence, the golden rule. And we are also meeting our second rule, the sustainable investment rule. This year debt as a share of national income will fall well below the 44 per cent we inherited - to 37.1 per cent. Last year we forecast that the overall budget would be in deficit for this financial year - that public sector net borrowing would be 3 billion pounds. I can now report that due to the performance of the economy and to prudent management, the Budget is not in deficit by 3 billion but in surplus by 12 billion pounds. Mr Deputy Speaker, we inherited a deficit of 28 billion pounds in 1997. This year we will make a debt repayment of 12 billion pounds. Too often in the past, at the first sign of a cyclical surplus, governments have fallen back into imprudent ways. It is because we have learned from the mistakes of the last forty years that this Government will maintain its prudent and responsible approach. The figures I am announcing today show that we will meet our fiscal rules over the cycle. We will meet our fiscal rules even in the most cautious case, on the most cautious assumptions, including the most cautious view of trend growth at 2.25 per cent. And Mr Deputy Speaker, I can announce today that I have decided to lock in a greater fiscal tightening next year and the year after than we promised in last year's Budget and Pre-Budget Report. After the measures I announce today our projection is for a current surplus next year of 14 billion pounds and for the years after, surpluses of plus 16, plus 13, plus 8 and plus 8. Debt to GDP, which was 44 per cent in 1997, will fall to 35 next year, then 34, and then 33 in each of the next three years. Net borrowing will be minus 6.5 billions next year, that is, we will make a debt repayment next year of 6.5 billion pounds. Then net borrowing in 2001-2 will be minus 5, a debt repayment of 5 billion pounds, with net borrowing for the years after 2002-3 of plus 3, plus 11, plus 13, well within our fiscal rules. So from this stable platform of sound finances I am able to set out today our prudent and responsible approach for future years. Having met all of our fiscal rules, paid off 18 billions of debt this year and next, and locked in a greater fiscal tightening, we are able both to set a new envelope for public spending and investment for the years from 2001 and to cut taxes for hard working families. I can report that our fiscal rules enable us to increase current public spending by 2.5 per cent a year in real terms for the 3 years from 2001 and double net public investment as a share of national income from 0.9 per cent next year to 1.8 per cent in 2004. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have always said that our prudence is for a purpose. And in this Budget, because of our continuing prudence, we can now take the next steps towards that purpose - a Britain of opportunity and security not just for a few but for all: - with stability locked in, and enterprise growing, we can meet our prosperity goal - closing the productivity gap; - with 800,000 more in jobs and the work ethic being restored, our full employment goal - employment opportunity for all; - with 50,000 more students and standards rising, our education goal - 50 per cent of young people in higher education; - with 800,000 children already lifted out of poverty and our civic society renewing itself, we can meet our anti-poverty goal - to halve child poverty by 2010 and end it by 2020. First, I announce major reforms today to reward enterprise and entrepreneurship; open up competition in banking; promote new and growing businesses and e-commerce - and balanced growth across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom. To remove more of the old barriers to new investment, I have decided on radical reforms of capital gains tax - beyond the tax cuts I set out in the Pre-Budget Report. When we came into Government capital gains tax was fixed at 40 per cent and we cut the long term rate of capital gains tax for business assets held for ten years or more. I have now decided to radically cut rates. I am announcing that from 6th April this year the new capital gains rates for business assets will be cut from 40 per cent to 35 per cent after one year, to 30 per cent after two years, to 20 per cent after three years, and down to 10 per cent after four years. I will make further tax cuts to remove the barriers that hold small and growing businesses back. Today business investors who own between 5 per cent and 25 per cent of a new and growing business do not benefit from the 10p rate. I will now cut their rate to 10 per cent for all investments above 5 per cent held for four or more years. I will make a further radical change - this time for Britain's unquoted companies. All investments held for four years will benefit from the 10 per cent rate. With both the lowest corporate tax rates for businesses ever and the lowest ever capital gains tax rates for long term investors, Britain is now the place for companies to start, to invest, to grow and to expand. I have a decision about one other tax on capital - inheritance tax. The threshold for inheritance tax is 231,000 pounds. I will next year raise it to 234,000 pounds. 96 per cent of people will be exempt from inheritance tax. I have one further cut in capital gains tax to be introduced from 6th April. So that millions more hard working people have a stake in the businesses whose wealth they create, we will remove the old barriers to a new share owning democracy. The all employee shareholding scheme which starts on 6th April has one defining requirement: that shareholding should be open to all employees. I can confirm that the 1.7 million people now in the 'Save As You Earn' scheme will continue to enjoy its benefits. I have also decided that high tech firms recruiting essential personnel will be able to offer share option incentives of 100,000 pounds for up to 15 employees. And the Financial Secretary will now consult on a technical solution to the tax treatment of share options in unapproved schemes. I can go further. In future all employee shareholders will secure all the benefits of the 10 per cent capital gains tax rate. Taken together, our measures are the biggest boost for employee shareholding our country has seen. The next step on our road to a wealth-owning democracy.

But Lucy Daniels is a publishing phenomenon. Since her first book, Kittens in the Kitchen, was published in March 1994, she has gone on to write nearly 100 more. Visit amazon.com and you will find more than 200 listings for titles in various editions, including audio cassettes, and earlier this year she celebrated five million UK sales. Now take JK Rowling. Her combined UK sales are just 1.7m, excluding internet and book club orders. So how come JK feels like an old mate and Lucy is a total nobody? The simple answer is that she is a nobody. She doesn't exist. She is a brand, not a person. The Lucy Daniels story begins with two men: Ben Baglio, an American children's book packager, and Rod Ritchie, managing director of Hodder prior to its merger with Headline. Baglio moved to the UK in the early 90s and had moderate successes with Mystery Club, a kid's crime series, and Mystery Kids, a Grange Hill-type series, both of which have since been dumped by Hodder. But with Lucy Daniels he struck gold. \"Vets and animals were becoming extremely popular on TV,\" says Baglio, \"and I had the idea of this idealised setting that harked back to those non-existent golden days when everyone knew each other, but nobody pried. I also had in mind a middle-American view of England as thatched cottages, but without the caricature, as I thought this might attract US sales.\" The idea that emerged was Animal Ark, featuring Mandy Hope, the daughter of two vets, who goes round solving crimes and injustices against unsuspecting members of the animal kingdom. But books don't write themselves, so Baglio and Ritchie turned to Lesley Hadcroft of Laurence Pollinger, one of the best-known agents for children's books, to tap into her stable of authors. \"Ben appeared with a brief that ran to a couple of sides of A4 and an advance of Â£1,200 per book,\" says Hadcroft. \"Together we commissioned the first six titles.\" The list of Animal Ark authors reads like a Who's Who of children's fiction. Sue Welford, a Whitbread prize nominee, Jenny Oldfield and Helen Magee, all of whom are names in their own right, have done a turn as Lucy Daniels. In Jenny Oldfield's case, she has done dozens of turns, and the reason is simple: money. A three-to-four-week spell spent writing a 25,000-word Animal Ark manuscript can net the author over Â£20,000 in royalties and foreign rights. The name Lucy Daniels was chosen extremely carefully. \"We wanted the author to be a woman, so we took the name Lucy from one of the editors at Hodder,\" says Baglio. \"The name Daniels was used to position ourselves next to Colin Dann, author of The Animals of Farthing Wood, on the bookshelves.\" Initially, the strategy backfired as sales were disappointing. \"Our original jackets featured Mandy and a furry animal,\" says Baglio. \"We decided to dispense with Mandy and make the animals much larger. We got in the artist who drew the cat on the Go-Kat packaging and he created some brilliant images.\" Since then there has been no looking back. In addition to Animal Ark, there are now Animal Ark Pets, the stories of some of the original animals when they were small, Animal Ark Hauntings, ghost stories with positive messages, Little Animal Ark, for younger readers, Perfect Ponies and Nine Lives. The possibilities are literally endless because for every new idea there will always be an author out there somewhere. The Lucy Daniels books are not bad books; many are surprisingly - or not so surprisingly, once you know the real author - well written. But the real success story lies in the sheer volume of titles. At one book a year, JK is positively idle compared with Lucy. Which is why, within the trade, there is a grudging admission that Hodder Headline may have cracked the holy grail of children's publishing with Lucy Daniels. Enid Blyton tends to be sneered at by almost everyone these days, but in more honest moments every publisher would sell his or her soul to have a non-stop production line of best-selling titles. The only difference between Daniels and Blyton is that one is real and one is not. Not that all those children who write regularly to Lucy and receive a copy of her newsletter know that. \"Lucy is real to many of our readers and we don't want to upset them,\" said a rather anxious woman at Hodder. If you think Lucy Daniels is the last word in cynical marketing hype, consider this. Have you ever wondered why JK Rowling wasn't called Joanna on the jacket? An authorial diktat? No. The marketing department at Bloomsbury thought boy readers would be put off by a woman's name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2000/mar/23/smoking","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-23T02:11:54Z","webTitle":"Â£200m to clamp down on tobacco smugglers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/mar/23/smoking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/mar/23/smoking","fields":{"headline":"Â£200m to clamp down on tobacco smugglers","bodyText":"An emergency package to contain a \"crime wave\" in tobacco smuggling was announced by Dawn Primarolo, the Paymaster General, yesterday as new figures revealed more than one in three cigarettes will soon be purchased illegally. Customs staff tackling the illegal trade will be doubled to 2,000, new X-ray scanners introduced in ports and airports and cigarette smugglers will face similar penalties to drug smugglers. Pub and club landlords will risk their licences if they allow premises to be used to sell smuggled cigarettes and tobacco. Fines of Â£5000 will be introduced for anyone caught possessing and/or dealing in smuggled cigarettes. The big smugglers will face seven years in jail. From next year all cigarette packets will carry a prominent \"UK Duty Paid \" mark - but ASH, the anti-smoking organisation, pointed out yesterday that the mark would be easy for criminals to counterfeit and would not allow investigators to trace the origin of smuggled goods. Ministers have set low targets for Customs and Excise, asking the organisation to recover some Â£2.3bn of the estimated Â£7.5 bn that the Exchequer is set to lose by 2003. This is less than a third of the revenue lost - but it will cost taxpayers only Â£209m to achieve this target. Figures released in the Treasury Red Book reveal how serious the situation is. In 1998 Gordon Brown got Â£8.2bn from tobacco duty, and last year this figure is estimated to have dropped to Â£5.7bn. This year the projected revenue is Â£7.4 billion - including the 5% increase announced yesterday - Â£800 million below the 1998 tax take. Ms Primarolo said that smugglers were gangs of hardened criminals who used the profits to fund more criminal activity, rather than \"Jack the Lads\" doing a few friends a favour. Around two-thirds of those caught smuggling cigarettes through the port of Dover already have convictions for offences ranging from fraud to drug smuggling and violence, she said. Later the Tobacco Alliance, which represents 26,000 independent retailers throughout the United Kingdom, welcomed the new measures but claimed that the government was still not tackling the cause of the crime. Paul Mason, national spokesman for the alliance, said: \"Yesterday's tax rise means it will be business as usual for Bootleg Britain.

Something about he whose belly hangs over his belt shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Mirror In The Bathroom (Please don't scream), that was my song. I lost the will to face reflective surfaces sometime in the late 1980s. A man has to eat. Until I went to India, I never knew how it felt to be Sean Connery. True, we have the same haircut and - as you may have noticed - a unique way of mangling the English language, but there the similarities end. No, it was more the film of Kipling's short story about Daniel Dravot, where Connery played the runaway squaddie who became a god king, that I was thinking of. My Man Who Would Be King moment came the morning a holy man sitting in the shadow of a 3,500-year-old mango tree thumbed a blood-red bindi to my forehead. I did not know it at the time, but for the 10 rupees I dropped on his plate, I was buying divinity. The first inklings of my new celestial status came when I stepped out of an old bull-nosed Hindustani Ambassador into the monsoon mud of the temple town of Kanchipuram. High on incense, and with my head still swimming after watching 108 granite phallic linga being given their morning bath of aromatic oils and coconut milk - now that's what I call pandering to the male ego - a small roadside shrine stopped me with a thump. There, outside a TV store, was Ganesh holding a satellite dish. Ganesh is the god of good luck on account of how his father mistakenly lopped off his head and replaced it with an elephant's one. Luck like that, I know all about. Yet he was lucky for me. Here was my first piece of unmissable Indian kitsch. And only a few metres away, as if planted there by Paul Theroux himself, was a sign in front of a jumble of market stalls which warned, \"Caution, drive slowly, bizarre area.\" It was my duty as a tourist from a country that has gone beyond belief to record this with all due sense of irony. So smug was I in the warm glow of superiority that such ironies bring that it took me a while to notice that the flocks of bicycles skidding through the puddles had all stopped to stare at me. Behind them, portly Indian pilgrims were taking pictures of me from the window of their Easy Go Jolly Boys tour bus. Suddenly I was the freak. One buck with orange teeth was pointing at me and laughing manically, but mostly this was a frighteningly solemn assembly. Now I knew staring was an Olympic sport in India but this was ridiculous. Westerners were surely not that much of novelty in this part of northern Tamil Nadu. Had I caused some grave offence? For some unfathomable reason, I said, \"It's all right, I'm Irish.\" A murmur went through the crowd. One very frail old man in a lungi sarong and loose turban moved forward and touched the sleeve of the kurta I had bought back in Brick Lane so I'd look less conspicuous. I put my hands together, and give him my best Ravi Shankar bow and beatific smile, thinking he was probably admiring my Bengali threads straight from the designer sweatshops of Bethnal Green. He mumbled something that ended in \"gee\" and backed off bowing. Drawing myself up to my full height, I walked back to the car trying to pretend there was no one there, and the multitude parted before me like the Red Sea before Moses. The crowds thinned and the country grew more rugged as we headed down the coast to the ancient city of Mahabalipuram, whose pagoda-like shore temples are proof of the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism from southern India as far as Vietnam and the Indonesian archipelago. This was the port of the Pallavas, and the home of their greatest masons. Every granite outcrop had been carved with some eye-popping scene from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana - demons, elephants and meditating mystics in medieval 3D - and from behind each of these boulders a small crowd and some scrawny goats would appear and follow me at a respectful distance. A new god had recently joined the pantheon that stare from the masons' workshops. She was taller and lither than the squat local deities, and the fact that she was carved from black granite made her look, with some poignancy, like a photographic negative. The masons call this new goddess Queen Diana. And even they laid down their chisels to gawk at me. The silence was equally deafening when I walked into the dining room of the nearby hotel until a plate hit the floor. I checked my fly and disappeared to the bathroom. After smiling as benignly as I could at the toilet attendant who had backed up goggle-eyed against a sink, I checked myself in the mirror. No, nothing unusual but for the bindi on my forehead. Pretty fetching I thought. I might even start wearing it to Millwall matches. The waiter who brought my biryiani stooped to place the plate in front of me then swivelled his head alarmingly so he could look straight up into my face. After about five seconds I winked at him, just in case he'd had a stroke. He withdrew, still staring, to a gaggle of other waiters who were peering at me from the safety of the kitchen door. A middle-aged woman of some authority then approached and, after some elaborately convoluted pleasantries, told me I looked remarkably like a \"great Indian\" who was also \"very pale and handsome with very little hair like you. We are honoured to have you at our hotel.\" Meanwhile, my biryiani was being videoed for posterity by an Indian tourist at the next table. The great patriot in question was Sanjay Gandhi, whose crusade to sterilise his less fortunate countrymen was itself nipped in the bud by a mysterious plane crash. Like many middle-class Indians, my host was convinced Sanjay the Snipper had the right idea. I was not so sure about a man who brought vasectomy to the masses whether they liked it or not. And I was not all that happy about being his ghost either. This was one apparition which did not want to rely on India's fabled capacity for forgiveness. The bindi would have to go, and I resolved to wear my silly Australian bush hat, in bed if need be. Some indignities were worth suffering for the sake of securing the family line. On the road back to Chennai, we passed a dusty village dominated by a sprawling, half-built memorial. It marked the spot where Rajiv Gandhi, Sanjay's younger brother who was brow-beaten into taking on the family business, was blown to bits by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber who ran from the crowd at an election rally to embrace him. It all began to make sense. Many things in India are not as strange as they first seem. Reincarnation is certainly the only way to explain Indian driving. After a short hop to Bangalore, a twee Raj town of botanical gardens and bungalows now bursting under the strain of south India's digital revolution, we drove in the dying light through eternal village India, where centuries slip away with every mile. Women scenically slaving in the glinting paddy fields, toothless toddy sellers beneath the banyan and tamarind trees. I might have drifted off into bucolic nirvana if I was not so convinced I was about to die. It's hard to keep your karma when a 10-ton lorry with a head of a demon on the bonnet is bearing down on you. They give you shots against everything else, but nothing can save you from Indian truckers, except possibly the amulets my saintly driver Mr Kumar hung from the bumper of his Ambassador to ward off the evil eye. Eventually you do as the Indians do - you stop worrying and start looking forward to your next incarnation. But southern India is worth every little risk, and don't kid yourself - the only danger you are likely to encounter in an Indian five-star hotel is the edge of the crease on your sheets. It is not like other places. The clocks keep time and the policemen get allowances for the upkeep of their moustaches. As we neared Mysore, my chatty guide Mr Baskir grew more and more lyrical about the city, its people and its food. The famous underwear factory, \"better even than your mighty Marks and Spencer drawers\", the magnificence of Maharaja's palaces and Sabu the elephant boy who was plucked from the nearby forest by the film director Robert Flaherty. \"Mysore is also the most beautiful smelling city in all India,\" Mr Baskir declared. And it was true, through the rickshaw fumes you could just catch the sweet warm whiff of jasmine. Mr Baskir, you'll be shocked to hear, is from Mysore. We bumped into the city as darkness fell behind the bouncing buttocks of a vast woman balanced on tiny moped. The mosques were lit up like Christmas trees for Ramadan and cattle garlanded in jasmine wandered through the narrow alleys of its bazaar. You would never have guessed from these sedate scenes that the forests around the city hid the lair of Veerappan, the most notorious bandit, poacher and sandalwood smuggler in all India. Poolan Devi, the Bandit Queen, and Robin Hood himself was nothing on the bold Veerappan, who had eluded the police and the army for 15 years, disappearing into thin air on more than five occasions when they thought they had cornered him. Even a retired police officer I met confessed that he had a sneaking admiration for him, and admitted that Veerappan, heavily disguised, once bought him breakfast before he set off into the hills to hunt him down. \"He is a demon,\" he smiled, \"but he is as brave and as clever as Hanuman [the monkey god].\" It is telling how often in the Hindu holy books the gods and heroic mortals are rewarded for circumventing the divine rules rather than sticking to them - they're not so much about doctrine as business strategies. I was deep into an exposÃ© in the Star of Mysore about fake beedies (cheroots) when a knock at the door of my hotel room stirred me from my Commander Champion throne. It was the valet with my \"goodnight rose\". It came with a little packet of mints and a few lines of Keats \" . . . and sleep/ full of sweet dreams and health/and quiet breathing.\" I hadn't the heart to tell him he died gasping of consumption. The one great treasure that Veerappan has not tried to strip from the neighbouring countryside is the amazing carved panels of the soapstone temple in the tiny village of Somanathapor. I'd like to think that he's an aficionado of the finer motifs of late ninth-century carving, but I see him more as a devotee of its wild, reeling depictions of the kama sutra. The playboy in Sanjay Gandhi - who had a politician's knack of never practising what he preached - was also a fan of the panels. It's not hard to think of him taking his paramours there in the moonlight to admire them. Now that I think of it, a few of the village unfortunates did look eerily familiar.

Over canapÃ©s and cocktails at Christie's in midtown Manhattan, they admired new works by Ganesh, Nom Chok and others. One of the artists was described as a 'major force' because of his 'distinctive style', another as a 'savant' of the school. An expert likened one work to that of the 'Abstract Expressionists' who were 'always trying to discover the beasts within'. But last week's show was different in one crucial respect: the paintings were by elephants. And when the sale started, bidding wars broke out: 50 paintings by seven Asian elephants raised more than $30,000 (Â£19,000). A deep blue painting by 16-year-old Indian elephant Ganesh fetched the highest bid of $2,100. 'I love the colour selection. I love the lines. I just had to have it,' said John Tunney, an entrepreneur who also paid $900 for a painting by Lukkang, a 20-year-old elephant from Thailand. Lynne Merrett of Connecticut thought the paintings 'so beautiful and innocent' and bid more than $1,200 for a work by Arum, whose style was compared by the organisers 'to that of Abstract Expressionism and Jackson Pollock'. The latest fad to hit the art world is the brainchild of two emigrÃ© Russian artists renowned for their eccentricity - Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid. They were dissidents in the Soviet Union who first came to attention in the 1970s satirising 'official' Soviet art by getting dogs to paint. Since arriving in the US in 1976 they have continued to explore animal paintings as a means of questioning accepted values of art, beauty and financial worth. But last week's auction was also intended to raise awareness and generate funds for Asian elephants, whose numbers have dwindled after a ban on the logging of teak left the animals and their life-long companions and trainers without a livelihood. The elephants had been used to haul logs. The project began when Komar and Melamid found out that elephants in American zoos have been taught to paint for two decades. 'It clicked right away,' says Komar. 'Here were 3,000 elephants without a job. Our goal became to have thousands of elephants producing thousands of paintings.' Five years ago they started working with an elephant named Renee at a zoo in Toledo, Ohio. Three years later they went to Thailand, where they have set up three elephant academies. Painting, they said, came naturally to the elephants. 'For thousands of years, elephants have been making mysterious characters on the ground with stones or sticks. Elephant art is only new to people, but it's not new to the elephants,' said Komar, 56. Mia Fineman, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, wrote in the catalogue that there were 'three major regional styles' in Thai elephant art. One tended to be lyrical and expressive, another preferred darker, cool colours, while the third 'tend towards saturated, tertiary colours like mustard and plum'. Researchers exploring the possibility of communicating with elephants in 1994 carried out a series of experiments in northern Thailand. The researchers drew pictures on paper; the elephants made images in trunk-tip moisture that were then dusted with paint powder to develop contrast. The report concluded: 'We drew realistic images, surreal images or abstract designs. The elephants drew images that we understood as abstract. If they had realistic meaning to the elephants, we were unable to grasp it.' Last week at Christie's, Andrew Ross, who teaches contemporary culture at New York University, said elephant art came from a school called senilism - 'as in senile,' he explained. 'It began at the Museum of Modern Art when people realised the abstract painter Willem De Kooning's paintings could have been done by any geriatric, so why not elephants?' His face broke into a knowing grin. Komar, who compared the style of many of his elephants to that of De Kooning, dismissed criticism that some of the paintings looked like the work of small children. 'Everyone is an artist and can put paint to a canvas, but quality is a different thing. Some of the elephants are more talented than others.' Are you laughing at us, Mr Komar ? 'It is not a joke,' he says adamantly. 'This is not a jest, it is a collaboration with the animal kingdom.' Yet for all their protestations, Komar and Melamid's first intentions may have been satirical. But Komar insisted: 'What started as travesty has become treasure. We started in the Seventies with dog art, but later we changed our perspective. We fell in love with the elephants.' The team has also exhibited photographs taken by a chimpanzee and aims to work with beavers using processed wooden boards on an architectural project. While animal art is unusual for Christie's, the auction house said it wanted to support a worthy cause and offer a new perspective on modern art. 'Of course you think at first you may be criticised,' said Christie's chairman, Stephen Lash, 'but this is interesting stuff. Art has always been controversial.' The support for elephant conservation drew bidders who remained sceptical about the paintings' merit. One, Catherine Stein, said: 'It's a way of contributing to the well-being of these animals, under threat from the ivory trade and other pressures.' But she added: 'It just goes to show how easy it is to get Americans to part with their money.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/mar/26/northernireland.leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-26T00:30:19Z","webTitle":"Trimble's gambit must triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/26/northernireland.leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/mar/26/northernireland.leaders","fields":{"headline":"Trimble's gambit must triumph","bodyText":"So where now, David Trimble? Politics is littered with examples of leaders who issued 'come on then, have a go if you think you're big enough' invitations to dissidents and found they were fatally weakened as a result. Margaret Thatcher, for one, must have viewed yesterday's events in Belfast's King's Hall with a certain weary sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu. She's been stalked by donkeys, too. Certainly, Martin Smyth's 348 votes was an ominously large warning to his courageous and more far-sighted leader. No politician in Britain or Ireland has risked more than Trimble in the past year, and the 56 to 43 per cent margin by which he keeps his job against a decent but uncharismatic challenger shows that he has been taking risks, and serious ones, with the Ulster Unionist Party as well. But we knew this already. So did he. His turning round of the decommissioning challenge, effectively asking the IRA to tell the world what it can do, and will do, was a clever gambit. He played the British Government with cold brilliance before the Assembly was suspended. He has been doing a better job for 'his people' than they seem to have the wit to understand. And for the rest of us, his value is his sinewy determination to come back to the negotiations time and time again, even if only to 'fail better'. One difference between Trimble and Smyth is the difference between taking responsibility, taking risks and simply crouching in your dug-out. Another is that they represent different visions of Unionism: Trimble's is progressive, not cutting itself from its ancestral roots, but acknowledging that the world must change. It is more liberal, more bourgeois perhaps. Smyth stands for the rock-like loyalism on which his followers wish to dash themselves. But it is based on a vision of the United Kingdom which is disintegrating elsewhere in Britain and on a religious fundamentalism which sits uneasily in a secular age. Smyth represents a future where there is no such thing as a change for the better. So it is desirable, perhaps, to flush out the 'no compromise at any price' people now. Before long, Unionist politics must be reshaped or there will be no settlement. Until the Assembly is up and running again, the danger of a long slither back to war is real. Trimble understands it. And now, having won his vote, however narrowly, he must push his worried, divided party further forward. Yes, it was 'too close for comfort'.

Both events were named Bloody Sunday. Both resonated far beyond the small towns in which they took place to the very democratic fabric of the nations in which they occurred. But the second was erected by the Alabama Historical Commission, a federally funded body dedicated to \"raising the awareness\" and \"reflecting the heritage of all Alabamians\".

As Lord Saville of Newdigate begins to take oral evidence at Derry's Guildhall this morning in the inquiry into Bloody Sunday, the nationalist community is feeling cautiously optimistic. \"My greatest hope is that the truth of what happened on the day is finally told,\" says Patricia Macbride, the manager of the Bloody Sunday centre in Derry. \"That the people killed and injured on the day are finally vindicated as innocent and that those who were responsible are held accountable for their actions.\" It is a substantial wish list, punctuated with scepticism. They have been here before. An inquiry in 1972 by Lord Chief Justice Widgery effectively exonerated the army of all wrongdoing, arguing only that some of their actions had \"bordered on the reckless\". More recently the army has admitted to destroying rifles that could have provided fresh and vital evidence to the inquiry, even after Lord Saville asked the Ministry of Defence to keep them safe. Nonetheless, Saville already promises far more than Widgery could ever deliver. The Widgery report was a 39-page document, written in 10 weeks. The Saville tribunal has already been running for a year and a half, and has collected around 60,000 pages, more than 5,000 photographs and 36 hours of videotape. As such, Saville has the potential to do for Northern Ireland what Macpherson did for Britain. It could confirm what a minority has been insisting for years, by elevating a long-held grievance to an established fact. It might illustrate how those responsible for maintaining law and order can and do use bureaucracy, malice and prejudice to ensure that those facts never emerge. And, by drawing a clear line of command from the pen pushers to the army snipers, it could show that the flaws that brought them about are not individual and erratic but institutional and endemic. The parallels are not lost on locals here. \"We have every sympathy with the way Neville and Doreen Lawrence were treated by the police,\" says Mickey McKinney, whose brother Willie was shot dead on Bloody Sunday. \"There was no sense of shock here that something like that could happen in Britain because we've all been through it.\" But even a partially favourable outcome will allow not just the families of those who perished but the entire city of Derry to move on. For so long as there is a logjam in the judicial process there will be a hold-up in the grieving process. The city has become defined by the events of Bloody Sunday. Coming into the Bogside you are struck by a huge white edifice announcing \"You are now entering Free Derry\". On the walls of the flats, which have now been renovated, are huge murals depicting what happened on the day. One row of flats, in Glenfada Park, has not been touched up. It bears a mural of an RUC man and a soldier beating a protester and bullet holes from Bloody Sunday which may be useful for the inquiry. The event is even being commodified. The Bogside has become one of the city's major tourist attractions; within Derry's historic walls you can buy T-shirts marking the event. Given the current state of the peace process, the political ramifications of an inquiry which finds the authorities guilty of systematic and pervasive wrongdoing could be immense. If nothing else it will provide a tangible context for the \"lack of trust\" which republicans refer to as the obstacle in the path of decommissioning and remove the facade that the British government is nothing more than an honest broker in a local religious dispute. \"Trust is a two-way street,\" says Macbride. \"Trust has not been forthcoming from them so there's not going to be much trust going to them.\" But a critical report from Lord Saville will not only provide a boost for the people of Derry but a jolt for the British, who practise a selective amnesia when it comes to ugly parts of our recent history. It could force us, not by guilt but by intellect, to redefine who we are through what we, as a nation, have done. \"I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations,\" writes Alasdair MacIntyre in his book, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory. \"I am born with a past; and to try to cut myself off from that past is to deform my present relationships. The possession of an historical identity and the possession of a social identity coincide.\" Which brings us back to the two monuments. For through the different ways in which the American and British establishments recognise their specific Bloody Sundays one begins to see where greater trust could emerge. The plaque in Selma shows that when it comes to the past the US has an ability to sacrifice parts in favour of the whole. They will admit a specific wrongdoing so that you may still retain some faith in the country's broader ideological narrative. Such an approach suggests that the nation's political culture is underpinned by a notion of right and wrong. By admitting it has been wrong it has the ability to claim that it has also been right. This does not make American history more morally acceptable. But it does make the official versions of it more believable. The absence of any common marker in Derry indicates how, in the United Kingdom, there is no such distinction. For when a nation rarely admits it has done wrong, even in the face of undeniable evidence, it denies the opportunity for any critical support. You can either believe in the whole or you can reject the whole. You cannot take it in parts. You cannot think that what happened in Derry was wrong and still believe in the union flag since the establishment still insists those wrongs were committed in the name of the union flag. Nowhere are these contradictions clearer than in Ireland. By apologising for the potato famine and expressing regret for Bloody Sunday, Tony Blair has made some commendable headway here. By setting up an inquiry he has set the ball rolling. Once again it will be down to a lord to pick it up and run with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/mar/28/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-28T01:22:22Z","webTitle":"Storm warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/28/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/mar/28/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Storm warning","bodyText":"For almost 33 years the principality of Sealand has appeared to be an eccentric English joke. In 1966 businessman and former army major Roy Bates took a fancy to a disused gun tower seven miles off the Suffolk coast. It measured 140m by 40m and had seen little action since enemy planes flew over on their way to bombing the capital. This, he thought, was just the place to establish his kingdom - or, to be more precise, his principality. He annexed the metal structure, originally known as Roughs Tower, and immediately installed himself as Prince Roy and his wife, a former beauty queen, as Princess Joan. Then they set about enjoying themselves. They furnished the tower, issued their own stamps and coins (bearing the head of Princess Joan), and passports. They live there part of the time - the rest of the year they live down the coast in Westcliff-on-Sea - but some of their friends live on the tower permanently to guard it. It hasn't exactly been a quiet life - there was a failed attempt to set up a pirate radio station, the acquisition of the nation's largest inshore fishing fleet, an attempted invasion by navy helicopters, an attempt by German and Dutch armed raiders to kidnap their son and a strange link to the murder of Gianni Versace. But now they are falling victim to a multimillion-pound fraud that police believe is being carried out over the internet. Somewhat ironically, the prince and princess are on holiday in Spain, travelling incognito as Mr and Mrs Bates, while the Spanish civil guard is investigating a gang that is involved in arms trafficking, drug smuggling and money laundering - all of which, it seems, is being conducted with fake passports supposedly issued by the Principality of Sealand. Members of the family are not the subject of this investigation and, says Michael Bates, Prince Roy's son, are completely innocent. His father had a visit from a detective from the serious fraud squad, acting for Interpol, last year, but that was very polite and amicable. \"There is nobody more anti-drugs than my old man,\" says Bates, \"and we have never done any money laundering. I am not saying we couldn't be used as a tax haven but we have never done anything like that.\" Tap \"Principality of Sealand\" into your internet keyboard and chances are two sites will appear prominently. One, at www.fruitsofthesea.demon.co.uk/sealand, is a site created by Michael Bates. Official. It tells you how the family's \"rights and claims of sovereignty over the island and its territorial waters have been ratified time after time over the intervening years by national courts and leading international jurists\". But there is a second website: the \"official website of the Principality of Sealand\", at www.principality-sealand.net. This site has a plausible explanation of the taking over of the island, features pictures of Prince Roy and his family, and is full of convincing officialese. \"The existence of the Principality of Sealand as a state and the 'de facto' recognition of it as a state was not only confirmed by expert opinions of renowned experts... but also by numerous legal acts undertaken by other states.\" True enough, as far as the family is concerned. But, says the family, the site is a fake. When you run a state that officially doesn't exist, it is hard to argue that someone is pretending to be you - but this is what the Spanish police are investigating. Princess Joan, 70, and Prince Roy, 78, are mystified by the latest investigation. But they are having a fine old time in a nice hotel on the Costa del Sol, where the former Miss Joan Collins from Essex does still think of herself as royalty. \"Would you ask the same question of Princess Grace of Monaco?\" she scolds. \"We declared an independent state and I thought if I had to have a title I couldn't think of a nicer one.\" They have spent millions on the island, she says, since the idea first came up during a spot of pub talk with her daring husband. People have suggested various schemes involving off-shore business schemes, but nothing came of them. \"Unless there was something that comes to the aid of England, we wouldn't do it. There is no way we would ever do anything anti-British. My family fought for generations. I am always English, no matter what. But I have dual nationality.\" The prince calls his wife \"the boss\", and they say they are as blissfully happy as when they got married, 51 years ago, within three months of meeting each other at a dance. And he loves his principality: \"Listen old boy, I like a bit of adventure. It's the old British tradition. Maybe Britain's changed, but there's a lot of us still about. We're very vulnerable - we are the smallest state in the world. We are wide open for criticism, but we are very careful; we don't want to do anything wrong.\" He reckons someone got hold of one of his passports and copied it to make huge numbers of forgeries. \"We have issued passports - several hundred. We have given them to people who work for us or people who need them. But we have never given passports [for] illegal entry. \" By contrast, the \"fake\" website under investigation says \"the Principality of Sealand has approximately 160,000 citizens\". In parts of the Spanish version, it reads, \"160,000 inhabitants \", quite difficult on an island 932 yards square. \"The population of the Principality of Sealand is primarily made up of businessmen. They live in the countries they originate from,\" the unofficial site says. \"From a political point of view, a micro-state like the Princi pality of Sealand is not very influential,\" it concedes. \"This is why the government of the Principality of Sealand founded the Sealand International Business Foundation (SIBF) as an instrument to efficiently safeguard the economic interests of the citizens organised in its network. \"Irrespective of his/her origin, race and his/her religion, anyone can become a citizen of the Principality if he is prepared to make use of his/her talents to establish and boost the acceptance of an emerging state.\" In the Spanish-language version of the site, respondents are asked to say what they are interested in: citizenship, ID cards, passports or driving licences. According to investigators from the civil guard, Spain's paramilitary police force, yesterday, those privileges are on offer to anyone willing to pay between Â£5,500 and Â£35,000 for a range of documents that includes titles, academic degrees and full Principality of Sealand diplomatic passports. They allege that a Spaniard from the southern province of Almeria, Francisco Trujillo Ruiz, is presenting himself as the \"Prince Regent of Sealand\". He drives around Madrid with diplomatic number plates and refers to his office, in a luxury building on Calle Serrano, one of the smartest streets in Madrid, as Sealand's embassy. The Spanish foreign ministry, like the British government, takes quite a different view. It does not recognise passports issued by the Principality of Sealand and says they do not comply with criteria laid down by the Schengen Treaty for international documents. But according to the investigation, several countries have been taken in by \"ambassadors\" who claim to represent Sealand and use their prestige in business deals. The embassies of Gabon, Paraguay, Nepal, Syria, Haiti, Liberia, Honduras, Jamaica, Pakistan, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Jordan and Turkey all responded to requests for information from Sealand representatives who claim to be preparing lucrative investments in those countries. Access to other Sealand privileges does not come cheap. There is a basic \"goodwill\" charge of Â£300 for the first contact. Membership of \"Mare Libertas\", described as Sealand's exclusive international business foundation, costs Â£25,000. Its main project was described as the construction of a micro-city in Sealand, with ports, sports com plexes, a medical centre, a cathedral, heliports and universities. Trujillo Ruiz's team all hold \"official\" titles. His legal adviser is described as the \"secretary general of the state\", and there is a \"foreign affairs minister\" and a \"chief political adviser\". The civil guard is investigating the group, which appears to be \"an organised crime ring\" concentrating its activities on falsification and swindling. Documents supposedly issued by Sealand have been passed to investigating magistrates, who will decide whether to order arrests. This is not the first time that passports from Sealand have found their way into the news. One was found on the killer of Gianni Versace, Andrew Cunanan, and he was said to have a car with Sealand diplomatic plates. In 1997 forged Sealand passports were used to launder drug money in Slovenia, and there were reports that 4,000 forged passports were sold at Â£1,000 a head before China's takeover of Hong Kong. People involved in an illegal pyramid-selling scheme in eastern Europe had Sealand papers; one had border stamps from Libya, Iraq and Iran. This hardly seems to be Prince Roy's fault, but it is easy to see how it happens. Official-looking, plausible papers from the Principality of Sealand may raise eyebrows in Britain but, reckon the authorities, it might not attract so much suspicion in new or faraway countries that, while aware that there are tax havens off the British coast, don't necessarily know the details. Michael Bates says he wrote to the Spanish website, asking them to leave his father's principality alone. Someone replied, citing connections with the good name of King Juan Carlos and paying tribute to the Sealanders. \"He said he'd written a book on Sealand,\" says Bates, which may explain the pictures on the site, \"but I'm thinking, what the hell is this all about. If you want, I'll go to Spain to confront them. I'd be only too happy to. They are doing us a dreadful disservice.\" Meanwhile, back on Sealand, people are doing very nicely, thank you. It has electricity, television, double-glazing in the 75ft towers. \"It's not a palace, but it's not too bad,\" says Michael Bates. There are ongoing talks about annexing more land, maybe within the next couple of years, and even setting up a casino. Though Sealand is not recognised by the British government, the authorities don't make life too difficult, he says. Ashore, he runs a shellfish business in Leigh-on-Sea, and says he has one of only 14 licences in the Thames estuary to farm cockles. He plans to keep Sealand going, even when his parents die. The principality has seen its way through other crises and it will see its way through this one. There have been worse moments. In 1967, when the Ministry of Defence tried to evict them, sending out navy helicopters and the Royal Maritime auxiliary vessel Golden Eye for what Prince Roy liked to call the Battle of Roughs Tower, gunshots and molotov cocktails were fired back - as a \"warning\". Prince Roy was hauled to court, but a judge ruled that the platform was outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, making the prince immune from his order. In 1978, German and Dutch raiders - businessmen - took over the tower in a KLM helicopter in a wrangle with Prince Roy involving several million deutschmarks. They kidnapped Michael and took him to the Netherlands. But within days Prince Roy had recaptured the island, sliding down 100ft ropes from a helicopter, fighting the invaders and capturing one of the raiders in turn. Gernot Putz, a 34-year-old German lawyer who had been a Sealand passport holder, was charged with treason and held for seven weeks. He received a \"pardon\". But Michael Bates and his family are sanguine about such things. The trouble with independent states, he says, is that they are always at risk from a coup d'Ã©tat. \"If you are your own defence, you have got nobody to bleat to.\" â¢ Additional reporting by Adela Gooch"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"media/2000/mar/28/tvandradio","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-28T01:22:32Z","webTitle":"Hear this","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/mar/28/tvandradio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/mar/28/tvandradio","fields":{"headline":"Hear this","bodyText":"In an age when only one country in the kingdom has missed the devolutionary boat, Jonathan Freedland recalls the ardent nationalist who demanded parliamentary rule for the English.

In what is casually referred to as this post-ideological age, our representatives fight shy of the grand, sweeping vision. They prefer to stick to this tax scheme, that guideline rather than the loftier terrain of national destiny. So when they dare talk big, we ought to applaud them, if only for trying. That is why we welcome the speech on Britishness and national identity that will be delivered today by the prime minister. We do not yet know every word he will say, but we are glad he is doing it. Leaders need to have a view of the country they lead. It is murky, vague stuff, but essential. We are glad, too, that his speech is not to be a token, one-off event. Instead it will be followed by variations on the same theme from Gordon Brown, Jack Straw and several others. Perhaps politicians in other countries would find such a collective round of head-scratching puzzling. But in Britain, at least since the war, there has been uncertainty about Britain's place in the world, even about its fundamental purpose. As Dean Acheson remarked so pithily, Britain lost an empire and had to find a role. Mr Blair's predecessors have all sought to come up with an answer. Britain would be Greece to America's Rome, offered Harold Macmillan. We would be the home of white-hot technology, suggested Harold Wilson. We would be a proud, capitalistic, semi-imperial nation once more, dreamed a flag-waving and hopelessly England-centric Margaret Thatcher. But none of those answers ever quite filled the gap. Now the hole where our idea of Britain should be is becoming more troubling. There are pressures from all sides. Nationalists in Scotland and Wales are de manding the break-up of Britain: what case can the union make in its own defence? Others imagine a federal Europe in which England or Scotland or Wales might have its own place, but with little need for the four-nation unit of the United Kingdom. Globalisation is playing a part, too: why do we need a structure like Britain, when we can be part of something so much larger - the world? Fuelling these questions have been historians like Linda Colley and Norman Davies, who have argued that Britain was only ever an artificial construct, stitched together for the purposes of empire. Now that the sun has set on that empire, the need for the union has gone. Not so, says Labour which, in an unexpected twist, finds itself cast as the unionist party of Great Britain. It argues that even if the union was a mere political project once, it is now a cultural fact with over 300 years to put down real roots. Britishness has become part of us, which cannot easily be discarded. Moreover, the government reckons Britain has far from outlived its usefulness. For it provides an umbrella which, by its nature, covers the full range of people living on these islands. Invented as a cobble-together of distinct nations, Britishness contains the very idea of difference within it. So, just as you can be Scottish and British or Welsh and British, you can now be Pakistani and British or Jewish and British without any contradiction. Britishness may well be the first nationality in the world which is inherently comfortable with dual or even multiple identity. As Britain becomes a more multicultural country, this facet of Britishness becomes an invaluable asset. Mr Blair is right to celebrate that today, and to launch a debate on what else this Britain of ours actually means - and what it might be for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-28T01:22:55Z","webTitle":"Bloody Sunday inquiry seeks 'simple truth'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland","fields":{"headline":"Bloody Sunday inquiry seeks 'simple truth'","bodyText":"Counsel to the Bloody Sunday inquiry yesterday started with what is expected to prove the longest opening address in United Kingdom legal history, vowing to uncover the truth \"pure and simple\" about one of the most notorious episodes of the troubles. Christopher Clarke QC, beginning the oral hearings, promised his team was committed to finding out what led the army to open fire on an anti-internment march in Londonderry 28 years ago. His determination was absolute, he said, and witnesses would be tackled without fear or favour. Members of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 unarmed Catholics on the illegal parade. One of the 14 people wounded died five months later. Mr Clarke, at the Guildhall in Londonderry, said: \"What happened on January 30 1972 was, whatever the truth of the matter, a tragedy, the pain of which has endured despite the passage of years. It was and it remains of serious concern.\" Mr Clarke admitted there had been problems in gathering evidence. The inquiry has been amassing documents for two years, and is expected to go on for at least two more years, making it the longest such tribunal ever. Mr Clarke said: \"There are those who have chosen to regard the task of the inquiry as impossible. It is not so. \"But what is true is the ability of the inquiry to get to the truth is dependent on two things: first, the extent and quality of the evidence available to it and secondly, the assistance that is provided to it. There are those who see through the distorted prism of guilt or anger, prejudice or predisposition.\" He said the understandable urgency in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday led to the failure of the lord chief justice, Lord Widgery, to find out what had happened. His report, accepted by Edward Heath's government as vindication of the army, had engendered resentment which had lasted until now, and not just among the families of those who died. Lord Widgery held hearings over 21 days. He delivered his 36-page report within three months, declaring the army had started shooting only after coming under gunfire, a finding furiously disputed by the bereaved and survivors. Mr Clarke said in contrast 1,400 witnesses had so far been interviewed for Lord Saville's inquiry. The search for evidence had taken the inquiry team from Nevada in the United States to Hong Kong and had included every continent except Antarctica. Although he recognised witnesses' memories may be failing, he hoped the passage of time would encourage frankness. He believed it would allow some now to face up to unpalatable truths. Mr Clarke said: \"Truth has a life of its own. Although the first casualty of hostilities, it has formidable powers of recovery, even after such a long interval.\" Several figures, including Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, who then led the IRA in Londonderry, have yet to provide statements. He said as he arrived at the Guildhall yesterday he would do so if he became convinced Lord Saville's inquiry was open and impartial. Mr Clarke warned he would use the powers of subpoena if witnesses refused to give evidence. All would be treated equally no matter what their power or influence. He pointed out witnesses had immunity from prosecution. None could face criminal action as a result of appearing before Lord Saville, except for committing perjury. Mr Clarke described the discrimination faced by Catholics in Londonderry in the run-up to Bloody Sunday, daily battles between security forces and local youths, and secret army documents highlighting military fears they were losing control in Londonderry. The inquiry continues today. Who, what, where - and how much? The judges The inquiry in the city's Guildhall is chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, an English law lord who usually sits in the court of appeal. Married with two sons, Lord Saville previously chaired a Department of Trade and Industry committee into arbitration, the findings of which were encompassed into the 1996 Arbitration Act. He is joined by the former New Zealand judge Sir Edward Somers, a judge in New Zealand's court of appeal from 1981 until 1990, and Canadian William Hoyt, who for 14 years was a court of appeal judge in New Brunswick. The court Technology is being used as never before. Each member of the Saville panel and every lawyer and official has a computer screen in front of him to study the thousands of documents which will be presented to the inquiry. Proceedings will be published on the internet daily. A virtual reality recreation of the Bogside will allow witnesses to mark positions on a large screen. They will, said one insider, be able to \"walk\" down the streets. It is expected to be at least a year before any soldiers are called to give evidence, with the inquiry chamber booked for two years. The cost The cost is Â£14m so far, and could reach Â£100m. In the two years since the inquiry was set up 1,500 statements have been taken from witnesses. Submissions have been taken from 610 soldiers, 729 civilians, 30 journalists, 20 government officials, politicians or senior military staff, and 53 officers in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are 16 QCs. The families of victims are represented by 10 senior and 10 junior counsel, instructed by six different firms of solicitors. The RUC and Ministry of Defence are also represented. Leading barristers at the inquiry receive Â£1,500 per day. Their juniors are fighting to have their rate raised from Â£750 a day to Â£1,000 a day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-28T01:22:55Z","webTitle":"Bloody Sunday inquiry: army's secret plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/mar/28/bloodysunday.northernireland1","fields":{"headline":"Bloody Sunday inquiry: army's secret plan","bodyText":"Twenty eight years on, the families of 14 unarmed catholics shot dead by the army in Derry in one of Northern Ireland's darkest days gathered for the start proper of what will prove to be the biggest judicial inquiry in United Kingdom history: Lord Saville of Newdigate's fresh probe into the tragic events of Bloody Sunday. It was an important leap in their long struggle to overcome security force claims that several of those killed on the anti-internment march in January 1972 were tainted: either IRA gunmen or nail-bombers. They have fought ever since Lord Widgery, the lord chief justice, exonerated the army within three months, ruling that paratroopers only started shooting after coming under fire. They listened as Christopher Clarke QC, counsel to the inquiry, began his mammoth four-week opening statement at the Guildhall, in Londonderry, saying he was determined to find the truth. He went on to relate a secret plan for the army to resume command of no go areas in Derry. The hardline proposals were forwarded three months before members of the first battalion of the Parachute Regiment shot dead the demonstrators. Lieutenant General Michael Carver, chief of defence staff, wrote to the prime minister, Edward Heath, warning there would be casualties if the government opted for the choice he recommended, to storm the Creggan and the Bogside to \"root out the terrorists and the hooligans\". He was seeking Mr Heath's recommendations. Bloody Sunday led to the restoration of direct rule from Westminster two months later, and it was to pour petrol on the flames of the troubles, acting as an immense force for IRA recruitment. Lord Widgery exacerbated the hurt in his speedy 36-page report exonerating the army. The bereaved and the survivors never accepted the findings, and eventually forced Tony Blair to announce the new inquiry two years ago. It is proving to be the biggest judicial investigation in UK legal history, with more than 100,000 pages of evidence amassed so far. Opening, Mr Clarke said: \"The tribunal's task is to try to discover so far as humanly possible in the circumstances and with the means now available, the truth. \"Not the truth as people see it. Not the truth as people would like it to be, but the truth pure and simple, however complex, painful or unacceptable to whomsoever that truth may be.\" On a glorious day in Derry, Linda Roddy held breakfast prayers with her family, hoping at last the clouds of 28 years were going to lift. The new inquiry marks the opening of hearts, she whispered, as she arrived at the Guildhall. Her brother, William Nash, 19, was on his way there in January 1972 when the anti-internment parade was halted 400 yards from its destination. The army opened fire, and he was one of 14 unarmed Catholics killed. The army claimed Nash was an IRA gunman. It was a disgusting lie, said his sister. All she wanted from Lord Saville's inquiry was for the security forces to admit it. She wanted no blame, no prosecutions. She took her place in the public gallery alongside Michael Bradley, 50, one of 14 wounded. He was due to start work at a painters the next day when he was shot in both arms and the chest. He has never had a job since. Mr Bradley said: \"I thought they were firing plastic bullets. We all ran, and then a woman told me a boy had been shot. I couldn't believe it.

But those words remain central to my vision of what politics in this country must be about. We have to recognise the huge changes we are living through and the challenges they present to this country. But also the opportunities for renewal that they offer. Standing up for our country means standing up for what we believe in. It means standing up for our values and having the strength to realise them in the modern world. It means standing up for the core British values of fair play, creativity, tolerance and an outward-looking approach to the world. It does not mean an unthinking resistance to change. It does not mean railing against the outside world. Modernisation is the key. It has driven everything this government has done - whether in our constitutional reforms or our reforms of the health service or the education system or the system of criminal justice or our relations with Europe. To fail to modernise would be fundamentally to fail Britain. But we modernise according to our core values as a country. And we do so on the basis of one key belief. That the United Kingdom is stronger together than apart; all the constituent elements of the Union: its great cities, regions and nations are stronger united than separate, stronger together than the sum of their parts. Our national identity is not some remote and abstract issue. National success is not a matter of pushing buttons and pulling levers. Long-term growth and prosperity and stability depend on a clear sense of shared objectives and shared responsibilities. Our failure in the post-war period to generate a clear sense of national purpose has hindered us. It left space for a culture to develop in which sectional social and economic interests have fought to secure rights for themselves without a corresponding sense of their obligations to work for the wider public interest as well. Indeed, I believe that the origins of one of the greatest failings of the economy in the post-war period - short-termism - can be located in our lack of a clear national purpose. Throughout the post-war period, in the absence of a shared long-term vision of where we were going, successive governments often succumbed to the temptations of boom-and-bust, successive generations of managers often focused on their own pay awards instead of the long-term performance of their companies and successive generations of workers often sought pay increases unjustified by productivity increases. We are living through a period of unprecedented change. The exponential growth of information and communication technologies is transforming the world's economies and making them increasingly interdependent. The breakup of the postwar international order and globalisation are calling into question systems constructed around the nation state. New ideologies of personal liberation and opportunities for self-fulfillment, made possible by social and economic change, are transforming traditional social structures and turning some inwards to themselves rather than looking outward to the nation and the state. In this new world, it has become increasingly fashionable to predict the death of the nation-state. A world in which capital crosses national frontiers at the push of a key, where air travel has made the outside world personally familiar to millions, where television has brought it into the homes of millions more, a world where supra-national organisations like the EU and WTO play an increasingly important role is a world where questions are inevitably going to arise about the continuing significance of national identity. What is the answer to such a challenge? Not to retreat into the past or cling to the status quo, even if it cannot sensibly be justified; but to rediscover from first principles what it is that makes us British and to develop that identity in a way in tune with the modern world. What makes Britain and Britishness important, valid, as necessary today as ever is a powerful combination of shared values and mutual self-interest. We are stronger together, economically and politically with the nations of the UK able to maximise their collective will and authority. In defence, foreign policy, economic weight, we are better off and stronger together. But, more important, our identity is not threatened by change. Our identity lies in our shared values not in unchanging institutions. It is when our values fail to be reflected in the institutions that govern us that Britain and British identity is under threat. When we came to office, the Party of no change - the Conservatives - were left without any seats in Scotland or Wales. Forces for change were left with no alternative but status quo or separatism. Devolution at long last offered a sensible modernisation of the partnership in the UK. Let Scotland and Wales do what they do best locally. Let the UK do what it is right to do together. The Conservative Party, in the Tory policy document on five guarantees for Britain, proposes \"English votes for English laws\". While rejecting a proposal to set up a wholly separate English parliament and now today re-affirming that they support devolution, they propose to exclude the Scots, Welsh and Irish from any discussion of laws defined as \"English\". The rest of Britain's MPs would, in effect, become second class citizens in the UK Parliament - voting on some issues but not on all of them - and the make-up of the executive would have to reflect the possibility of defeat on English issues even if a majority was available for British issues. But what their proposal reflects is a complete misunderstanding of reality. The measures needed to protect a minority are not always the same as the measures needed to protect a majority. England can if it chooses outvote Scotland, Ireland and Wales at any point. English MPs are in an overwhelming majority in voting through the money for Wales and Scotland. It is the recognition of this that makes devolution a fairer settlement for the future. The growing pressure for regional change in England - decentralisation in London, the first steps to better local government in our cities - are a logical consequence of the policy of modernisation. In Northern Ireland - if, as I do, we value the Union - we had to make progress on fairness and a recognition of nationalist aspirations. What we then are left with is an identity not shaped by institutional rigidity, but by values and common purpose. That purpose is a Britain that is stronger, fairer, modernised to be fit for the new world we live in. That is a constant recurrent theme in all the Government does: modernisation based on values. The NHS is not just a necessary part of a civilised society where need not wealth should determine health care. It is a unifying force. It is a true British service. It represents the best of British values in action. But it has to be updated and reformed to take account of the new opportunities and challenges of today. On Europe, standing up for Britain does not mean being anti-Europe. It is not pro-British to be anti-Europe. The EU is part of the modern world. Britain is part of the EU. Standing up for Britain means fighting for British values, getting the best for Britain, whether it is economic reform, moving Europe closer to the USA or protecting the British rebate. Likewise, at a time when individuals have been becoming increasingly empowered in their personal lives and increasingly aspire - and rightly so - to the prerogatives of citizenship, how could a healthy body politic defend the political privileges of hereditary peers and deny the right to freedom of information and to the protection in British courts of the European Convention on Human Rights ? I believe few would disagree with the qualities that go towards that British identity: qualities of creativity built on tolerance, openness and adaptability, work and self-improvement, strong communities and families and fair play, rights and responsibilities and an outward looking approach to the world that all flow from our unique island geography and history. If these values are what makes us British, rather than unchanging institutions, the devolution is a necessary part of keeping Britain together; more regional decentralisation in England makes sense, City mayors with real power have their place; hereditary peers in the House of Lords don't; and a constructive engaged attitude to Europe reflects the best of British values of openness and leadership in the world. Of course, there will always be those who argue the consequences of change will always be worse than the consequences of sustaining the status quo. But, I think this is as much a cast of mind as a political analysis. And this criticism usually falls into one of two broad categories - both of which play essentially on atavistic fears of the future. The first category of criticism is a traditional Tory one - based on the claim that the pre-devolution, pre-reformed House of Lords, political institutions have been a uniquely important part of British national identity. Changing them, in this view, destroys something quintessentially 'British'. Of course they have been historically significant, but they have never been anything more than a reflection of the needs of the British people at any one time. They are not eternal expressions of the British character. To change them does not mean that something quintessentially British has been destroyed, that a part of 'Britain has gone. On the contrary, it is quintessentially British, it is one of our distinguishing characteristics as a people, that we have always been willing to adapt our institutions to changing circumstances. In the 19th century, in response to tumultuous economic and social change, we reformed the suffrage not once but three times. This first critique amounts to little more than sentimental nostalgia. The second critique is more argued: that somehow a process has been unshackled which will not run its course until the Union has disintegrated - that the institutional recognition of complex and enriching plural allegiances will somehow lead - inevitably - to their replacement with simpler and more excluding identities. And, of course, there are those, like the SNP, who argue that this would be positively desirable and that the Union has had its day and the sooner it is unravelled, the better. Of course, the great currents in our national life which have produced the climate in which such radical constitutional reform became necessary and was implemented will not suddenly cease. Of course they will continue to flow. But this does not dictate a retreat from an inclusive British identity to more exclusive identities, rooted in 19th century conceptions of territory and blood? It is actually just not possible to construct any practical and meaningful national identity on such a basis. Why should we want to? 20 per cent of the population of Wales was born in England 7 per cent of the population of Scotland was born in England 745,000 people born in Scotland live in England: equivalent to 15% of the Scottish population. Why should anyone want to say to all these people that they should suddenly become foreigners in the land they live in ? This nation has been formed by a particularly rich complex of experiences: successive waves of invasion and immigration and trading partnerships, a potent mix of cultures and traditions which have flowed together to make us what we are today. Blood alone does not define our national identity. How can we separate out the Celtic, the Roman, the Saxon, the Norman, the Huguenot, the Jewish,- the Asian and the Caribbean and all the other nations that have come and settled here ? Why should we want to ? It is precisely this rich mix that has made all of us what we are today. Both current critiques of our constitutional reforms, I believe, are rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between a democratic people and the institutions they consent to have rule over them. New institutions do not necessarily create new feelings. They can just give longheld feelings new - and often better - expression. 'This government's progressive programme of constitutional reform is now moving us from a centralised Britain, where power flowed top-down, to a devolved and plural state. A new Britain is emerging with a revitalised conception of citizenship, as the House of Lords finally is reformed to remove the democratic anomaly of the hereditary peers, as the European Convention of Human Rights is incorporated into British law and as we bring in, for the first time, rights to Freedom of Information. This is a complex journey towards a revived sense of ourselves, applying to modern life historic British values and qualities. I entered politics to fight for the changes I believe are necessary to modernise this country. I believe in the importance of preserving our British identity and I will fight to strengthen the Union. I will fight against all those who would weaken the Union, whether those forces of conservatism who oppose change on principle or those separatist nationalists who wish to see Britain die.' Our vision is of a Britain that thrives on optimism, on shaping its own destiny not cowering before the might of the global economy. For us Britain succeeds when we ally our courage to our imagination. The courage that won wars. The imagination that built the NHS. Ours is a vision of Britain where pride comes from a strong economy that can compete in the world, and rising living standards that benefits all. A Britain where pride comes from a modern constitution that strengthens the nations of the United Kingdom. Where pride comes from strengthening British values - creativity helping us build a knowledge economy, fairness guiding our fight against child poverty, reward for hard work helping us return to full employment, rights matched by responsibilities guiding us in the fight against crime and the reform of welfare. Ours is an outward looking vision that believes in Britain's place in Europe, but believes Britain will always be much more than that. A \"pivotal\" nation - a bridge between East and West between the United States and the EU. In this new world, a new modern patriotism is needed. That is what we offer. See Britain as it is seen from abroad today. An economy gaining in strength. A society seeking to combine enterprise with investment in public services that bind the nation together. A politics that from relations within the UK, to pursuing peace in Northern Ireland, to engaging with Europe, is prepared to change to overcome the problems of the past and rise to the challenges of a changing world. We can have confidence in our future. Britain is no longer in decline. We are rediscovering our strength and values. We are uniting those values to a common purpose: modernising the nation for the 21st Century. If we succeed, Britain will be stronger and fairer, on the road to providing opportunity and security for all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/mar/28/devolution.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-28T14:57:29Z","webTitle":"Labour tries to reclaim the flag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/mar/28/devolution.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/mar/28/devolution.uk","fields":{"headline":"Labour tries to reclaim the flag","bodyText":"Tony Blair will today try to kick start a debate on the nature of modern Britishness when he leads off a series of speeches by a group of his cabinet colleagues - Gordon Brown, Jack Straw and David Blunkett. A Blair aide explains the thinking. \"For over a century, the Conservative party has successfully wrapped itself in the flag. By contrast the left has seemed to have had a blind spot about nationalism regarding it as an awkward fault in human psyche. \"But until we are sure we are sure about our own British identity, we cannot resolve our relationship with Europe. \"If we can get this right we can associate Labour with the values and institutions the British people hold most dear and regard as emblematic of Britishness - decency, tolerance, liberty fair play. Even more, we can start to put some pressure on Hague. He will have to decide whether he is going to put himself at the helm of a new English nationalist party, or remain the leader of the Conservative and Unionist party.\" Labour, in its various guises, has made many previous efforts to wrest the union flag from the party of Churchill and Thatcher, and conspicuously failed. The task was made more problematic in the 80s by Labour's commitment to defence cuts and unilateral nuclear disarmament. Many on the left also felt alienated by the traditional notions of Englishness, unable to come to terms with what they regarded as its blend of imperial nostalgia, conservatism and xenophobia. Nevertheless, Neil Kinnock repeatedly tried to reclaim the patriotism for the left, placing the union flag on his party platform and most of his manifesto documents. Before the 1997 election it was largely left to Jack Straw to pursue the English question when he wrote in the New Statesman: \"For the left it it is time to end the rightwing ghetto in which public feeling for England has been for too long corralled.\" Mr Blair himself strikingly tried to break the Conservative link with the flag in his first speech as party leader in 1995, claiming \"Labour is the true patriotic party\" and accusing the Tories of waving the union flag at the close of their party conference when they \"have spent 16 years tearing apart the fabric of our nation\". In the 1997 election campaign Peter Mandelson paraded a bulldog in an attempt to associate Blairism with the British fighting spirit. But in government the \"cool Britannia\" theme was aborted, almost as soon as it was launched. Some currently associated with the present Blair initiative regarded the bulldog and Britannia episodes as crass beyond belief. At the time of the bulldog episode, a group, largely around Gordon Brown and including his former speech writer and now industry minister Michael Wills, had been thinking about the modern British identity. The challenge of devolution, Europe, globalisation multi-culturalism and the \"privatisation\" of many British institutions was making British identity ever harder to grasp. Mr Brown's group had gone so far as to commission qualititive and quantitive polling to find out what values and institutions had come to represent Britishness in the public mind. They discovered the NHS was the single most cherished and unifying institution in Britain and even emblematic of British values. The group also held seminars with thinkers such as the historian Linda Colley, chosen two months ago to give a mil lennium lecture at Downing Street on Britishness in the 21st century. She called on Labour to \"take a healthier, more comprehensive and less apologetic view of our past\", adding the British are not a \"nice, but an interesting people\". The poll findings suggested the public associate Britishness with decency, outwardness, the work ethic and tolerance. These, the Brownites claim, are the values of the centre-left. Moreover, the findings showed the British regarded themselves as a pluralist nation, able to accept different identities, including Scottish, Welsh, Irish and English. Devolution and the integrity of the United Kingdom were compatible. Similarly, the Blairites claim a true reading of British history reveals a nation committed as much to Europe as to a far flung empire. A government minister explains: \"Britain has never been a narrow chauvinst country. From Plantagenets, Tudors Hanoverians, Palmerston to Churchill, we have been committed to Europe. We have to assault this notion that you cannot be pro-British if you are pro-European.\" The Blairites also reckon there is a straight political gain since, they believe it places Mr Hague in a quandary. He has referred in militaristic tones to the drumbeat of English nationalism, and called for English votes for English laws. But there are also powerful Unionist voices inside the Conservative party, not least Lord Cranborne and Michael Ancram, the chairman. Gordon Brown claims that Mr Hague, by becoming so obsessed by the break up of Britian, has missed the essential British magic. \"Perhaps uniquely in the world, Britain is not just a society of many communities, but also a country of nations - with large, contiguous areas of distinct national heritage. \"Instead of a bland Britain, Britain is buzzing with difference; no longer a state in monochrome, but a nation in living colour.\". How Blair has attempted to redefine patriotism â¢ \"The New Britain\" was a Labour slogan in the 1960s as the party, led by Harold Wilson, focused on the need for social and economic change. As the economic climate worsened, the catchphrase \"I'm Backing Britain\" was coined, to encourage shoppers to buy British goods. â¢1986 Neil Kinnock claimed patriotism as one of Labour's principal values, telling the Scottish Labour conference that his patriotism was the \"confident and generous patriotism of freedom and fairness\". â¢ 1995 Tony Blair attacked the Tories for waving the union flag at the close of their conference when they \"have spent 16 years tearing apart the fabric of our nation\". He called on voters to help turn Britain into a nation reborn. \"One Britain. That is the patriotism for the future.\" â¢ 1997 Election campaign mastermind Peter Mandelson introduced the bulldog, in a party political broadcast, as a symbol of New Labour, saying: \"Some may be surprised that we use the bulldog. But New Labour is the party of one nation and the bulldog is a way of saying this. It is an animal with a strong sense of history and tradition.\" â¢ 1997 In his party conference speech later that year Tony Blair used the word \"Britain\" 53 times, \"country\" 31 times, and \"nation\" 19 times.

A report by the London-based human rights organisation says that on average two people are beheaded every week in the desert kingdom, which has increased its use of the death penalty, despite the world trend towards abolition. Alleged robbers have their hands and feet amputated, often after unfair trials. Offences related to alcohol consumption or breaking the strict moral code are punishable with flogging, the report says. Vague laws on \"sabotage\" and \"terrorism\" are used to prosecute perceived government opponents and political parties, elections, independent legislature, and trade unions are all banned, said Amnesty at the start of a six-month campaign to highlight abuses in the kingdom. The report says migrant workers, particularly those from poorer countries in the Middle East, African and Asia, are vulnerable to abuse from their employers as well as from the authorities. If arrested, foreign nationals may be tricked or coerced into sign ing a confession in Arabic, which they may not understand. Migrant workers are frequently tortured and ill-treated, Amnesty says, and are more likely than Saudis to be executed or punished by flogging or amputation. Many expatriate workers exchange horror stories about acquaintances who ended up in jail or were deported for offences ranging from traffic violations to arguments with employers. The report describes how women who go about unaccompanied or are in the company of a man who is neither their husband nor a close relative risk being arrested on suspicion of prostitution. They are terrorised by the Mutaween or religious police who patrol public places on the lookout for \"moral offenders\". The Mutaween shout at women to cover their hair and sometimes their faces. \"The Saudi Arabian government spares no effort to keep its appalling human rights record a secret, and other governments have shown themselves more than willing to help maintain the secrecy,\" says the report, entitled Saudi Arabia: A Secret State of Suffering. With oil prices at their highest in years, the US and other western nations, busy lobbying oil producers to increase output to put a cap on further price rises, are unlikely to rock the boat by condemning Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Home to thousands of US and British troops since the Gulf war, the kingdom has earned itself the mantle of trusted ally of the west, often to the detriment of those seeking to flee its oppression. Hani al-Sayegh, a 30-year-old Saudi who was seeking asylum in the US, was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia in October 1999. He was detained on arrival as a suspect in connection with the bombing of a US military complex at al-Khobar in 1996 - an offence punishable by death. He continues to be held without access to lawyers and is at risk of being tortured, Amnesty says. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world in both absolute numbers and per capita, it says. In February 2000 alone, 11 people were executed. The state executes murderers, drug smugglers, rapists and those convicted of other violent crimes. Amnesty recorded 90 judicial amputations between 1981 and December 1999, but says the true number is probably higher. Amputation is prescribed for causing injury and for theft, punished by amputation of the right hand, and for highway robbery, punished by amputation of the right hand and left foot. Saudi officials rarely respond to the charges of human rights groups. If they do, they deny abuses and say the punishments meted out are based on Islamic law, and that strict judicial criteria and safeguards are applied. But Amnesty says the Saudi Arabian justice system \"from the outset treats suspects as guilty and the lack of independent mechanisms for reporting torture and investigations into allegations have all fostered a climate of fear, secrecy and impunity\". Case studies: Victims condemned without defence Nieves's story A Filipino married mother of two, Nieves worked as a secretary at King Fahd National Guard Hospital in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. She was arrested by Mutaween religious police on 9 November, 1992, while celebrating a friend's birthday at a restaurant in Riyadh. Her group included a married couple and a single man and woman. The Mutaween suspected the group of prostitution after they found money in in the bag of one of Nieves's friends and accused her of accepting the money for introducing Nieves to the single man. They tricked the group into signing \"confessions\", which were used against them at a court trial. Nieves was sentenced to 25 days in prison and 60 lashes. \"I could not describe the pain,\" she said. Nieves was deported to the Philippines immediately after serving her sentence. Abdul's story Abdul-Karim al-Naqshabandi, a Syrian, was arrested, tortured into signing a confession and then convicted of \"witchcraft\" after a secret, summary trial. He had no access to a lawyer and had no opportunity to defend himself, even though he was charged with an offence punishable by death. In a letter to the court, he protested his innocence: \"They did not give me a chance to defend myself. The investigation was carried out by just one person, but they all ratified what he had to say even though they had not heard what I said to him. \"He threatened me with a beating and they tied me up like an animal. I had to sign to protect myself. I signed in the hope that I would find someone in the police who would want to listen to the truth, but I was surprised to be treated even more severely. The officer put his shoe in my mouth, beat me up, put me in a cell, and did not allow visits. He threatened me with worse treatment if I refused to agree to the confession in court. I ratified my confession in the hope that someone would listen to me in court.\" Naqshabandi argued that he had been framed by his employer after refusing to help with false testimony in a business deal. He gave information that threw considerable doubt on the case against him, but it is not known how the court dealt with his defence. He was executed on 13 December, 1996."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/mar/30/tvandradio.television","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-29T23:55:00Z","webTitle":"How I tamed Ali G","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/mar/30/tvandradio.television","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/mar/30/tvandradio.television","fields":{"headline":"How I tamed Ali G","bodyText":"When Channel 4 rang me last year to ask me to take part in a new television programme designed to introduce young people to politics, I agreed at once and greatly looked forward to it. Since \"New Labour\" was elected, there has been a notable de-politicisation of young people, many of whom tend to think of the prime minister as if he were the well-liked manager of a successful United Kingdom football team, whom they admire as spectators without much sense of personal involvement. Like many MPs, I visit a lot of schools and speak at student conferences; these sessions are always followed by questions which reveal the pernicious influence the tabloids have upon their political thinking. When he arrived, Ali G was courteous and friendly as I welcomed him into my office and, in his first question, he asked me to explain socialism, which he seemed to believe was the same as the welfare state but went on to argue that all strikes were motivated by laziness, almost as if he was a leader-writer in the Sun. It was at this early point that I decided that the only respectful thing to do was to argue with him and to do so as vigorously as I could. There was nothing else I could do since all the crudest prejudices poured out of him, not least his argument that all \"bitches\" just got pregnant to get on to benefit, and so on. Although I found his questions deeply offensive, he was very polite to me personally, and I concluded that his views were based upon a deep ignorance - as when he claimed that Mrs Thatcher was a Communist. At the end, he turned to the camera and said \"Tony Benn is my main man\", and put out his hand in my direction in some greeting of good will, and left after I had told him how much I had enjoyed our talk. At no stage during our talk did I suspect for a second that it was other than a genuine programme, and when the interview was broadcast and someone rang to tell me about it, I was very angry and wrote to the production company demanding a video, which I watched. That should be the end of a simple story of an old man being completely fooled by a comedian in a hoax interview - but there was a sequel which showed it all in a very different light. Lots of young people came up to me in the street, or wrote in to say how much they had enjoyed the programme and how glad they were that I had stood up to him. I didn't know what they were talking about until one of my teenage grandsons bought the Ali G video at Christmas and we all sat down, as a family, to watch it. It was, indeed, a hilarious series of interviews with a range of people who had no idea how to deal with Ali G's questions and were puzzled, confused and silent when pressed to explain some absurdity in their own opinions. These responses were made possible by his feigned naivety, warm expressions of regard for whoever he was talking to, and an absurd emphasis addressed to the television audience of the importance of the person with whom he was talking. For me the high points were when he asked the general whether he had ever thought of changing sides in the war, and respectfully inquired whether the head of the Orange Order would be ready to marry a Catholic girl \"if she had a stereo\". All the interviews on the video were of the same general kind, and although they were extremely funny to watch, they all were genuinely educational in that anyone watching them would be bound to question their own prejudices and think about the real issues raised. In fact, the programmes were exactly what Channel 4 had said they would be - a chance to present politics to young people. Ali G is a very clever man, and I am beginning to wonder if that was what he actually intended to do.

Businesses - and not just internet service providers (ISPs) and e-commerce outfits - are becoming seriously alarmed about the cost of additional equipment and the administrative impact on their staff. Britain is in danger of having one of the least enabling regimes in the world as Home Office attempts at \"balanced\" legislation too often favour the needs of plod/spook over those of citizens and business. Ireland, France, Germany, even Singapore and other countries to which many UK e-businesses could easily migrate, appear to be taking a much more liberal line. The regulation of investigatory powers (RIP) legislation is yet another Home Office bill in trouble. Few quarrel with its aims: to bring into a single law the disparate regimes for the interception of telephone traffic, use of bugs and opening of letters, as well as defining circumstances to compel decoding of encrypted data. But assessment of \"balance\" needs detailed knowledge - not widely available among politicians - of datacomms, e-commerce and crypto protocols, and the practicalities of surveillance. And the result must comply with human rights and data protection laws. The outcome has to be turned into precise wordings that can be applied by warrant-issuers and the courts. Finally, since so much of the enforcement depends on the co-operation of private sector communications service providers (CSPs) - including telephone companies and ISPs - the laws and associated codes of practice have to become part of a manageable, affordable regime. That's the trick the RIP bill must pull off. The 1985 telephone tapping provisions (in the Interception of Communications Act) assume voice traffic only and BT as the main significant operator; RIP recognises new realities. There are now more than 150 telco operators, land and cellular, and even more acting as ISPs. It properly includes data, and covers private as well as public systems. CSPs have to make \"reasonable\" provision to facilitate warrants and to do so without alerting suspects; but as suspects may have several phone numbers and multiple email accounts, will telcos and ISPs have to prepare for one interception per 16,000 lines (the current figure for telephones) or one in 500 (as touted by the Internet Service Providers Association)? It's unclear how far the government will fund this. Even here, Home Office rhetoric that it doesn't want new powers but simply to maintain existing capability runs into difficulty: a single telephone conversation is easy to identify and isolate; not so data traffic where many simultaneous emails, world wide web requests and file transfers all occupy the same pipe and look pretty similar as data packets. How do we stop the intercept from exceeding the intended scope of a warrant? It's in relation to encrypted data that many of the problems lie. The first situation is stored data that is seized under warrant in a raid and which once decrypted might become evidence. RIP makes it an offence not to provide plain text or a key - but who does the asking and how does a court assess if a key has been genuinely rather than conveniently lost? And on whom does the burden of proof lie? It is much more difficult where there is a warrant for covert interception of data in transmission which turns out to be encrypted. Here the recipient of a decryption demand will be an innocent third party. He or she may have severe contractual and data protection obligations to other users of the same crypto system but faces criminal sanctions both for non-compliance with a RIP demand and for any action which might lead to a suspect being tipped off. And if legitimate users of the crypto system suffer because of law enforcement clumsiness, what remedies do they have? One needs to look at the whole mechanism of RIP to see the extent of the difficulties: different types of activity give rise to a variety of warrants and demands, some issued by judicial figures, most by ministers, some simply by policemen. The range of bodies that can ask for (but not always issue) warrants extends as far as the inland revenue and the benefits agency. Criteria are sometimes \"for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime\" and \"safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom\" (in clause 5) but elsewhere \"for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime\" and \"in the interests of economic well-being of the UK\" (clause 21 - on traffic data). MPs in the standing committee reviewing the bill have complained about the proliferation of oversight tribunals and commissioners with varying powers and to whom the private citizen has variable rights of access as well as to information about suspected intercepts that might make such application meaningful. Ministers have justified the complexity by saying that the right balance has to be struck for many different circumstances. MPs have also been concerned that some RIP provisions offer a covert means for the security service, secret intelligence service and GCHQ to extend their territo ries into traditional police and customs territory. It is possible to guess why the RIP bill has taken this form: the scenario builders at NCIS, Cheltenham and the Thames-side fortresses read the same internet scare stories as the rest of us. They make projections about the powers they might need, partly to increase their influence but also because they fear they may not get another slot in a very crowded legislative calendar. And ministers lack knowledge to challenge their threat assessments. Peter Sommer is a research fellow at the LSE, special advisor to the commons trade and industry select committee and has been an expert witness in \"computer crime\" trials for 15 years. \"It will wreck our e-commerce hopes for the UK.\" Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, opens the debate on the RIP bill The new economy means we need an updated and revised framework for the legal interception of communications. But the proposed regulation of investigatory powers (RIP) bill won't make Britain a better place to live, and it'll wreck our hopes to create in the UK the world's best environment for e-commerce. RIP proposes powers to demand, even from an innocent person or business, the electronic keys that will unlock not just one or two messages, but perhaps all one's traffic to date. Though earlier attempts to legislate to secure copies of decryption keys have failed, and though other countries have turned their backs on the idea, the British government is still trying to secure a general right of access to them for a wide range of state authori ties, and for loosely defined purposes. Furthermore, at the government's whim, you cannot tell anyone, even your wife or your boss, that this has happened. This is intrusive for individuals. Business is slowly waking up to the enormity of these proposals, which have no parallel anywhere in the world. From this seriously flawed start, the RIP proposals degenerate. They seem to have been devised by redeployed cold warriors who want to put Britain on a paranoid infowar footing. Meanwhile the rest of the e-world plans a prosperous future based on trust in robust security without unwarranted interference. Do you still have every key, password, PIN number, cash card you have ever owned? Do you ever lose computer files by mistake? Under RIP, if you don't have your decryption key any more, you're liable to two years in jail unless you can prove to a court, on balance of probability, that the key was lost or destroyed. I can commend home office minister Charles Clarke for now joining the debate, and his boss Jack Straw for conceding in the house that there is room for improvement in the bill, but we first pointed out these problems to the government two years ago. Mr Clarke recently said in a letter to this newspaper, \"We believe that we've struck the balance right\", and that \"innocent people are not going to suffer under these proposals.\" Ministers come and go, but the legislation they leave defines our rights and freedoms. There is nothing in RIP that stops these powers being used arbitrarily. Although we've proposed many amendments, the RIP bill cannot be patched up. It must be withdrawn and rewritten. Law enforcement's task is not helped by unenforceable laws: we need, instead, a law that suits an aspiring e-commerce leader. \"The bill does not outlaw any form of encryption.\" Charles Clarke, home office minister, replies: I welcome a constructive dialogue on the RIP bill. I agree that we need to update law enforcement powers for the digital age. Not surprisingly though, I do not hold with your other assertions about the government's proposals. The bill is about ensuring, as best we can, that powers crucial to keeping this country a safe place for everyone to live and work remain effective in the face of technological advancement. Some of these powers, interception of communications for example, are particularly intrusive. That's precisely why they should, as the bill proposes, be closely regulated. This is a difficult area. New technologies, the growth of the global knowledge economy (and our desire to be a leader in it) and the penchant of criminals to exploit whatever new ways they can to evade detection throw up new challenges. Encryption raises difficult, some might say unique, problems. But we would be putting our heads in the sand if we didn't tackle them. The bill does not outlaw any particular encryption technology or mandate the use of any particular key management system. Individuals and businesses alike remain free to use whatever technology best suits their needs. What the bill does is provide a power, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has a key to unlock particular encrypted material, to require the disclosure of that key or the data itself in an intelligible form. The power only applies to lawfully obtained material. And if you've lost or forgotten a key then there is a statutory defence for you. Neither of us wants to see criminals being able to use the latest technologies with impunity. You want to see an individual's rights upheld. So do I. You don't want to see business encumbered by unreasonable burdens or draconian laws. Neither do I. This is all about a balance and I believe that the bill strikes the right one. The bill will not be withdrawn. There is cross party support for the thrust of what is being proposed. But as you (almost correctly) point out, the home secretary has said that he hasn't yet introduced a bill that has not benefited from careful parliamentary scrutiny. The RIP bill is important and it deserves such examination. And that's just what is happening. We're going through the proposals in committee now, clause by clause. Mr Bowden replies: The RIP bill is about what it says, not necessarily what you say it is about. There's nothing criminal about using encryption, but RIP treats everyone as suspect. Bad memory - maybe two years in jail will help? As we use more websites, email, digital TV, and smartcards to live more of our lives through cyberspace, use of encryption is essential to stop fraud, blackmail, identity theft, and just to preserve a little privacy. But most people don't even realise they are using encryption when they make up a password. You can't bully people into recording every one as if their liberty depended on it. In the real world, 10% of ordinary computer users lose data by forgetting keys - passing a law won't change that. You assume everyone prosecuted will be a villain, refuse to say how they can prove they are not guilty, and then assure us that the innocent will not suffer! That's not the job of a politician. We have a judiciary to sort out the innocent from the guilty, on the basis of evidence. The trouble with your \"statutory defence\" is that there is no evidence when someone forgets something, so criminals with a lot to hide will always plead a bad memory. The jury or magistrate (if mode of trial goes through, people won't have the choice) will simply have to guess whether the defendant is lying. RIP requires no evidence (46.2.b.2) of an underlying (let alone serious - 46.3.b) crime in order for decryption to be demanded. So here are four questions about RIP Part.III that we've been asking for a while: 1) How can a person who loses a password reliably prove their innocence \"on the balance of probabilities\"? 2) The handling centre for keys in the MI5 building may be secure, but what about keys in transit? MI5 lost a laptop the other day, and an encrypting modem disappeared from No.10 in 1998. How much is guarding seized keys really going to cost? 3) Won't RIP encourage \"steganography\" (or information hiding), which will exacerbate law enforcement's problems ? 4) It's true RIP doesn't insist that companies lodge spare keys with \"trusted\" third-parties anymore, but you are making company directors liable to imprisonment (S.69) if they cannot comply with a decryption order. Isn't this \"key-escrow by intimidation\"? I am sorry that you have closed your mind to the possibility that this part of the bill is misconceived. But the opposition parties have clearly signalled that they will withdraw support if their serious concerns on these and other matters are not met. There are a hundred amendments tabled before decryption is due to be considered. Will you allow the committee to take its time? Mr Clarke replies: The committee is scrutinising the bill carefully. And it will continue to do so. As you assert, it's important to see what the legislation actually says. Innocent people are not going to be imprisoned for having a bad memory. Remember a vital point. The bill does not allow the authorities to get their hands on material which they cannot do now. The new power only works where material is lawfully obtained. If it is encrypted, and someone who is in a position to decode it refuses to do so, only then does the question of a prosecution arise. Where prosecutions occur, the authorities have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person has, or has had, a key. How do you demonstrate that you've lost or forgotten a key? You explain what has happened and the court will decide whether, on balance, you're telling the truth. There are statutory defences if you hand over as much information as you can. If you've forgotten your key, you might explain how it was generated, when you last used it and what you normally do if you forget it. Your earlier analogy of losing a PIN is inappropriate. I can't think of an occasion when a bank would be unable to provide details of an account when required to do so under existing powers. This isn't escrow by intimidation. The cost of establishing the technical facility which will handle keys obtained under the bill will be met from the money the chancellor has provided for tackling crime in the capital modernisation fund. Deploying the highest level of security for such keys is a top priority. Will criminals turn to other forms of information hiding post-RIP? We cannot tell what the future holds by way of other technologies that may or may not be taken up by criminals. Experience tells us that they will use what most readily suits their needs. The implication that the bill treats encryption users as suspect is wide of the mark. We know the technology is good for e-business, individuals' privacy and helps prevent certain crimes. It's also important to our e-government agenda. The bill does not criminalise the use of encryption. It targets the criminals, such as paedophiles, who use it to conceal their insidious activities. Mr Bowden: RIP doesn't target anyone at all - it's a blunderbuss which an extreme government could abuse for its own purposes. It's a pity that once again you seek to justify an unworkable encryption policy by associating it with an abominable crime. Child pornographers should be severely punished and deterred, but a responsible government would begin to give law enforcement the training and resources to defeat encryption when necessary through technical surveillance devices, and put in place an oversight framework with teeth to see that these powerful new capabilities can never be abused. The course on which your officials have ill-advisedly committed you will enmesh us further in a culture of secrecy, which will corrode our democracy long after you have left office and anodyne reassurances have been long forgotten. A law which replaces the presumption of innocence with a medieval trial-by-ordeal is simply wrong, not \"a question of balance\". Mr Clarke: The RIP powers are necessary. But we've never said that they represent a panacea for all law enforcement's ills. We know that simplistic answers no longer work in today's fast changing technological environment. Last year's joint government/ industry task force on encryption and law enforcement recommended that a package of measures is needed if we are to have any hope of addressing effectively the threat posed by the criminal use of encryption. We're putting that package in place. Providing new powers, specifically recommended by the task force, forms an integral part of our approach. They require authorisation and are subject to independent oversight. But we're also providing law enforcement with a dedicated resource to assist over encryption and forging a new co-operative relationship with industry. These too are vital elements of the package, on which I place great store. This isn't about \"corroding\" democracy. It's about helping keep society safe.

Fears of a unionist backlash against the report, which called for the removal of royal symbols from Northern Ireland's courts, proved unfounded as Ulster Unionist supporters of the Good Friday agreement made clear they could live with its findings. The response to the review of the criminal justice system, set up under the Good Friday agreement, was welcomed by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson. The report, likely to be implemented after a six-month consultation period, would introduce sweeping changes to Northern Ireland's legal system to remove what nationalists see as overtly British symbols. Judges would no longer swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen, and an independent commission would be set up to increase the number of nationalists sitting as judges. In the most controversial area of the report, all royal symbols would be removed from inside Northern Ireland's courts. However, the Royal Coat of Arms would remain on the outside of existing courthouses and the union flag would continue to fly. The report's authors underlined their determination to strike a balance between unionists, who see royal symbols as an important sign of Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom, and nationalists who regard such symbols as alien. \"We considered the removal of all symbols but felt that this could be misinterpreted as being inconsistent with Northern Ireland's constitutional position,\" the report said. \"On the other hand, we are conscious that the presence of the Royal Coat of Arms in a prominent position in the courtroom could be regarded by some as inconsistent with the need for court proceedings to take place in a neutral environment.\" Their even-handed approach was welcomed by allies of Mr Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party leader. Duncan Shipley-Dalton, a UUP member of the Northern Ireland assembly, said: \"We're quite pleased to see the crown symbols will be retained on the exterior of court buildings so the overall ethos remains British and clearly an integral part of the UK legal system.\" His remarks were welcomed by sources at the Northern Ireland Office, who had feared the Ulster Unionist reaction to the criminal justice review would mirror the party's response to the Patten commission's report on the RUC, which also recommended the removal of royal symbols. Grassroots Ulster Unionists registered their opposition to the Patten commission last weekend by voting to block Sinn Fein from rejoining the Northern Ireland executive if the government implemented the RUC reforms. Mr Trimble disagreed with the vote, although he rejects the key recommendations of the Patten commission. Ulster Unionist opponents of the Good Friday agreement rejected the criminal justice review. Jeffrey Donaldson, the UUP MP for Lagan Valley, said: \"The review will have the same impact as the Patten report and it could be extremely damaging at this very sensitive time.\" Ministers will fear the Donaldson faction, which was strengthened last weekend when it captured 43% of the vote in a party leadership challenge against Mr Trimble, may also try to use the new report to lay down further conditions over the formation of the power-sharing executive. Unionist opponents were also angered by other key recommendations in the report. These included the setting up of an independent public prosecution service to take over the work of the DPP. Sinn Fein said republicans would wait to see whether the report delivered a major overhaul of the Northern Ireland justice system.

Over the next year the Royal Shakespeare Company is to stage all eight of Shakespeare's Histories in chronological sequence. It kicks off with Steven Pimlott's fiercely intelligent, modern-dress Richard II in the Other Place, converted by David Fielding into a space resembling a white-walled squash-court or science lab: a perfect setting for this masterly dissection of kingship. Modern dress, even when stylised with lots of maroon and grey maxi-coats, creates problems for this most ceremonial of plays, one that is steeped in medieval myth and that shows the notion of the king as God-sanctioned monarch giving way to personal ambition and legalistic statecraft. But Pimlott and his designer, Sue Willmington, pull it off in various ways. They suggest Richard presides over an already divided kingdom: one in which rancorous bullies confront each other in the lists at Coventry, with lethal axes. They make good use of symbolic props, including a long wooden casket which variously becomes throne, vertical mirror and coffin. Above all, with the aid of Simon Kemp's bright, overhead strip-lighting, they give the work a strong European dimension: it becomes a Brechtian analysis of the nature of power. One could pick holes in the execution: I distrust the modern habit, already seen in Macbeth this week at London's BAC, of plucking lines from the fifth act to use as a choric refrain. But the abiding impression is of dazzling clarity. Samuel West's Richard moves from heedless tyrant to Christian martyr with absolute, and absolutist, conviction. Donning crown and ermine when it suits him, West shows the raging wreck that lurks beneath: he lunges at the prophetic John of Gaunt like a berserk thug and, having been likewise ticked off by the Duke of York, promptly makes him Lord Governor. West also captures Richard's accelerating self-consciousness - he wraps himself in the national flag for the Westminster deposition scene - and mordant irony: his cry to Bolingbroke of \"Here, cousin - seize the crown\" ripples with taunting ambiguity. I have known more lyrical Richards: what West conveys is the character's progress from Ceaucescu to Christ. David Troughton's Bolingbroke is also brilliantly effective: an overweening politician who cloaks driving ambition under a sense of wrong - \"I am a subject and I challenge law\" - and who swiftly dispatches Richard's followers with a bullet through the brain. But, having staged his takeover, Troughton also captures the hermetic isolation of power, making redundant the decision to end the play with the opening lines of Henry IV Part One. David Killick's dithering York, Christopher Saul's Machiavellian Northumberland and Adam Levy's armed-to-the-teeth, SAS-style Harry Percy lend unflinching support. The production, since the Histories will have a variety of directors, may not provide a pattern for the future. It does, however, rescue Richard II from medieval pageantry and reveal its modern relevance as a study of the way revolution often begets tyranny. â¢ In rep at The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 403403), till October 5."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2000/apr/02/newsstory.sport6","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-02T21:09:10Z","webTitle":"Sky in Â£250m World Cup bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/apr/02/newsstory.sport6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/apr/02/newsstory.sport6","fields":{"headline":"Sky in Â£250m World Cup bid","bodyText":"Sky have offered Â£250 million for the exclusive United Kingdom television rights to the next World Cup in 2002. The satellite broadcaster wants to become the British 'gatekeeper' for the rights, forcing the BBC and ITV to negotiate with them, rather than Fifa, to show matches. This would even include England games. If Sky's bid succeeds, it would mean viewers who wanted to watch games in the peak evening viewing time having to subscribe to Sky's satellite or newer digital channels, both of which are pay-TV services. Because of time differences, live games from the tournament in Japan and South Korea will start in the early hours or at lunchtime. The UK's 'listed events' legislation prevents Sky showing the matches exclusively live, as the entire World Cup is a protected event. However, there is nothing to stop them sub-licensing live games to the BBC or ITV and keeping for themselves the rights to re-runs in the evenings, when most viewers will want to watch. The eight-hour time difference between Britain and the co-hosts means many of the games will be screened when most people are asleep or at work. Sky believe this will make live TV rights much less valuable than usual and the rights to show games 'as live' later in the day will be of greater value. These rights are not covered by listed events regulations, which protect live transmissions of important sports events. Japan proposed last week that games begin at three different times, which in British Summer Time would be 3.30 or 4am, 6 or 6.30am and 1.30pm. Fifa want kick-off times adjusted to ensure that more fans in Europe can watch matches as they happen. The BBC acknowledge that kick-off times could be a problem. 'They are still talking about middle-of-the-night kick-offs and that clearly doesn't suit European broadcasters,' said a BBC Sport spokesman. 'That would inevitably affect the value of the rights.' He refused to say if the BBC would negotiate with Sky, should their bid be successful. Sky's offer is more than double the Â£115 million paid by Spain's Via Digital in the biggest deal so far agreed in Europe. However, Sky would expect to recoup a good slice of the fee from selling on live rights to a listed events broadcaster (the BBC, ITV or even Channel 4). Prisma, the sports agency selling the rights in Europe on Fifa's behalf, is thought to have reservations about granting Sky the 'gatekeeper' role for such an important listed event. If Sky succeeded, there would almost certainly be a public outcry, with Sky accused of deliberately depriving viewers of the opportunity to watch matches when most working people will be able to watch them - unless they subscribe to pay-services. Prisma is owned by Germany's powerful Kirch Group. Sky recently took a 24 per cent stake in Kirch's German pay-TV service Premiere World. Under listed events legislation, Sky would be allowed to show games exclusively live if, having offered the matches to free-to-air broadcasters on 'fair and reasonable' terms, their terrestrial rivals turned them down.

This is a comedy of manners crackling with ideas: about feminism, commitment, politics, Africa and the West. Rush brilliantly sustains the voice of his central character - hyper-analytical, drily witty and honest to the point of mania - and makes the post-colonial city and the new community itself familiar and concrete. The question of the community collapses a little too easily into personal dilemmas. But this is no doubt the point.

Granta 69: The Assassin Edited by Ian Jack Granta Â£8.99 pp256 Granta, the quarterly book-cum-magazine of new writing, believes in the value of description. In its blend of memoirs, photojournalism, reportage and in its championing of contemporary realist fiction, Granta has its face firmly pressed up against the window, determined to witness the world. This faith in the redeeming power of the writer risks self-indulgence. But more often, as in this issue, the faith is vindicated. The title piece is a moving biography of the half-European, half-African who killed Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of Apartheid. It is a quietly masterful work of restoration, giving back to the supposedly insane assassin a history of perpetual statelessness and disturbed politicisation. Diana Athill, former editor of V.S.

So he hit the road, seeking out representatives of what he calls the republic: workers of the deindustrialised North, reviled travellers, Odinists, fetishists, drag queens and Rastafarians. Yes We Have No is reportage committed to whirl with a whirling world. Cohn writes with gusto and can slip from one milieu to the next, his eyes wide open. But does the mosaic really work? Cohn rarely stays with anyone long enough to move beyond curiosity and spectacle. And when he does, he too readily sketches another 'plucky prole'. It is good to see 'Other England'. But these are indeed 'adventures' without binding insight. For that, you would be better with Tony Parker or Andrew O'Hagan - or the US gonzo journalists whom Cohn sometimes resembles. â¢ Stephen Brown Spinners Anthony McCarten Picador Â£6.99, pp272 Buy it at BOL When 16-year-old Delia Chapman is abducted by aliens in the little New Zealand town of Opunake, the townsfolk are overwhelmed with excitement.

Here the author of The Gate of Heavenly Peace examines the way in which Western travellers to China, poets, diplomats and missionaries, from Marco Polo onwards, described their experience of the Middle Kingdom. These chapters, which began life as a lecture series, have a witty and accessible tone which breathes life into a subject that in other hands might be unapproachable and obscure. Spence elegantly demonstrates that commentary about China is often as curiously timeless as the subject it explores, saying as much about our own preoccupations and anxieties as China's. You close the book with the thought that, even now after the moderrnising upheavals of the twentieth century, we are as ignorant of this extraordinary country and its people as ever. â¢ Eldon King"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/05/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-05T00:33:47Z","webTitle":"Minister to speed applications of asylum seekers found begging","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/05/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/05/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","fields":{"headline":"Minister to speed applications of asylum seekers found begging","bodyText":"New measures to speed the applications of asylum seekers caught begging were announced last night by the immigration minister, Barbara Roche. The personal details of any foreign national arrested by the police for begging will be passed immediately to the Home Office's immigration and nationality directorate and if they are found to be asylum seekers their cases will be rapidly processed. \"It is my policy to ensure that all asylum seekers, including those convicted of begging, whose applications are unfounded, are removed from the United Kingdom as quickly as possible,\" she said. Although the Home Office would not put a timescale on it last night, in practice it means their cases are likely to be resolved within two to three months rather than the average wait of just over a year. The decision to take new powers against asylum seekers found begging followed a case in which a coachload of claimants was sent back to London from Glasgow after they were allegedly caught asking for cash. Home Office ministers decided to press ahead with the crackdown even though the local authorities involved soon agreed it was a misunderstanding and the asylum seekers were sent back again to Glasgow. The Refugee Council said last night that it wanted to see the government speed up the process for all asylum seekers. \"We have repeatedly said that the answer to the current backlog of cases is for the Home Office to implement a faster as well as a fairer decision making system.\" The announcement came as the police said fraud squad detectives had launched an investigation into allegations that illegal payments were received by landlords responsible for housing nearly 2,000 asylum seekers in Northamptonshire. It is believed more than Â£425,000 of public money has been lost. New checks have been put into place by Northamptonshire county council to ensure asylum seekers are still at the address which the landlord claims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/apr/05/zimbabwe.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-05T00:33:51Z","webTitle":"It's home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/05/zimbabwe.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/apr/05/zimbabwe.comment","fields":{"headline":"It's home","bodyText":"As a white Zimbabwean, I watched the xenophobia and government-directed lawlessness in my home country with some despair. For the first time in nearly 40 years my relatives there voiced a fearful uncertainty about what tomorrow, next week and the period running up to the country's general election will hold. They know better than I that Robert Mugabe will hang on to power for as long as he possibly can, not least because he fears being brought to book for his systematic human rights abuses. My elderly mother speaks carefully, circumspectly, (sometimes in her native Gaelic) on the telephone; the mail that I receive from Zimbabwe has invariably been tampered with. And yet, I know that neither my relatives, nor most white Zimbabweans of my acquaintance, have any doubt that their future remains in Africa. For one thing, they represent the hardened rump, at 75,000, of a white population that stood at 300,000 when Ian Smith's gerontocracy still smirked at the possibility of black majority rule in the next thousand years. Those who loudest sang the chorus to \"Rhodesians never die\" have retired to other climes, Perth in western Australia, the Cape in South Africa, or even the outer reaches of the United Kingdom from Tunbridge Wells to the Monday Club. The whites still in Zimbabwe represent a group who have adjusted remarkably well from the rule of the rebarbative Rhodesia Front to the blessings of democracy under Zanu - Patriotic Front. Some whites, of course, could not leave if they wanted to, simply because the ruination of the Zimbabwe dollar means they could not afford it. Some are too old to go. But many others stay because they regard Zimbabwe as their land and are tied to it by that whole fine web of memories and dreams and associations that give a country to a people. Not every white is a farmer. Whites serve on Aids charities, the Anglican cathedral's lay commission, human rights organisations and conservation groups. Not every white owns a tennis court and a swimming pool. My parents, teachers from the idealistic days of the federation to the ominous days of Robert Mugabe's ascent to power, had neither. My father's ashes are scattered in a dry Matabeleland churchyard; my mother makes a daily visit there. My brother, a young conscript in Ian Smith's war, works for a company owned by a black businessman; his children learn SiNdebele at school, in preference to French, and they speak it well. The farmers, particularly those in Matabeleland, have stayed tenaciously on the land, through both Smith's war and the vicious post independence \"dissident\" campaign that saw 61 of their number killed in a short period by guerrillas who were trained and armed in part by a white, Christian, South African government. Some farming families have lost fathers and sons, paying a biblical price for their farms and ranches. They are good farmers and, yes, their employment practises probably are feudal. They provide the only economic security their workers are likely to find in a cruelly impoverished country. There are precious few stellar social structures or relationships in Zimbabwe at present. And it is certainly the case that farmers are now investing considerably in money, in land and in expertise both to improve their workers' lot and in private land redistribution projects that answer the suicidal rapacity of the ruling party's land grab. Which brings me to my best hope for the future of white Zimbabweans: Robert Mugabe. He has created the spectacle of stuffy whites marching and dancing, and being beaten by Zanu (PF) stalwarts, in the streets of Harare, shoulder to shoulder with black Zimbabweans. He has played the race card for all it is worth and has still been humiliated in a referendum defeat where his supporters, who ran the referendum, were ultimately unable to rig the result. He has created a determined national consensus against \"white bashing\" - and, indeed, the demonisation of Zimbabwe's tiny Asian community. Whites are active as human rights campaigners and lawyers. They have helped to bring forensic experts from Argentina to Zimbabwe to identify the remains of their fellow citizens who were this government's first victims. Ironically, in the 80s, when the Fifth Brigade killed anywhere between 8,000 and 30,000 rural Ndebele people, and made a blood-chilling attempt to starve to death 400,000 more, Robert Mugabe was still being feted across the \"civilised\" world. So it is likely, in the coming weeks and months before the election, that things in Zimbabwe will become pretty hellish. But the country has been to hell before, and emerged (a quarter of a million people were displaced in the civil war; over 30,000 died). If his party wins the election, Morgan Tsvangtral may prove to be capable enough to reverse the country's decline. He may be an unknown quantity, but as an Ndebele priest I know put it, \"Sometimes, better the devil you don't know than the devil you do!\" I hope that there will be whites in Zimbabwe one hundred years from now. I pray that they will include my descendants - who will perhaps remember the epic sojourn of their ancestral spirit in exotic Walthamstow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2000/apr/07/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-07T00:29:16Z","webTitle":"John Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/07/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2000/apr/07/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"John Green","bodyText":"The radio producer John Green, who has died aged 90, made serious, even challenging, discussion acceptable to a BBC still trammelled by Sir John Reith's fear of arousing controversy or being accused of partiality. What's more, he did this from a career which began and ended as a specialist in farming and gardening matters. In a rare pleasantry in his massive History Of Broadcasting In The United Kingdom, Asa Briggs says of Green that \"he was, to use farming metaphors, both down-to-earth and cultivated.\" Ironically, Green was recruited by Reith in 1933, when a pupil barrister at the Inner Temple, after winning a place there from Cambridge University, where he had been president of the union. Reith was apparently worried by the underlying leftwing attitudes of some talks producers, and wanted to hire someone of the right. Green's first assignment was to set up a regular gardening talk for the rising number of listeners, who, as the suburbs spread, had gardens to tend. His choice of expert to deliver the hints and advice was inspired. CH Middleton, soon to be universally known as \"Mr Middleton\", was one of four gifted sons of the farm bailiff at Renishaw Hall, seat of the Sitwell family, and the only one to pursue a similar career, as gardener to the younger son, Sacheverell Sitwell, at Weston Hall, in Northamptonshire, and pillar of the local horticultural society. His quiet, friendly chat at 12.15 on Sundays, just ahead of Sunday dinner, swiftly became an institution. \"He seemed,\" wrote the critic Peter Black, \"to enlarge the business of cultivating one's garden into a serene and comforting philosophy.\" Green also started a farming programme bluntly called For Farmers Only, which, on the outbreak of war in 1939, was crassly taken off - only to be reinstated at the urging of a Ministry of Agriculture desperate for an extra channel of communication to the growers of the nation's food. With the Dig For Victory campaign, Mr Middleton likewise acquired national importance. Green now launched further speakers to give practical advice. Notably, there was the radio doctor, Charles (later Lord) Hill, and John Hilton, who handled what would now be regarded as social services issues, such as service married allowances, wartime separation and war pensions. The BBC had steadily become bolder in its general editorial policy. The Sunday night Postscript was famously accused, when JB Priestley delivered it, of being a manifesto for postwar socialism. As the end of the war approached, however, old misgivings arose again, sharpened by implications of wartime propaganda. In a signed chapter in the 1945 BBC Yearbook, Green defended the Englishman's right - he was quoting Dr Johnson - to be informed, but looked ahead apprehensively to those who might one day \"bombard words against the privacy of the home with all the concentrated force of modern organisation and technique\". In 1950, he was the logical choice to head a BBC working party set up to determine how the BBC should aim its factual output: which was more important - to be topical and newsy or to aspire to \"more abiding themes\"? Green was subsequently put in charge of the current affairs side of talks, and set up a panel of 12 experts to provide background information, suggest speakers and sometimes take part themselves - in other words, an attempt to provide the immediacy that listeners seemed to want, but ensure that it was wise and informed as well. One of the first fruits was the regular series At Home And Abroad, whose rollcall of speakers in its first year included Pandit Nehru, Christian Dior, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Chinese premier Chou En-Lai. There was also an interview with Archbishop Makarios, leader of the Greek Cypriot independence movement, which drew a protest from Sir Winston Churchill, possibly the last of many he chalked up before he retired from office in 1955. Later that same year, Green took over as controller of the whole talks division, remaining in this post until it was abolished in 1961. By now, he found himself regarded as an expert on rural broadcasting, and wound up his BBC career with a mission to Australia and New Zealand to report on their local radio. He retired to Gloucestershire, becoming chairman of the Agricultural Advisory Council for five years. His wife, Judith, died in 1996. â¢ John Dennis Fowler Green, broadcaster and agriculturist, born May 9 1909; died March 25 2000"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/07/northernireland.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-07T00:29:17Z","webTitle":"Key Mandelson concession on police badge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/07/northernireland.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/07/northernireland.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Key Mandelson concession on police badge","bodyText":"Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday offered a concession to unionists when he declared that British symbols, possibly including the crown, are to be incorporated in the cap badge for the new Northern Ireland police service, to be set up within the next year. In a move which was designed to shore up the position of David Trimble, Mr Mandelson rejected a central proposal in Chris Patten's policing report that badges should be \"entirely free from any association with either the British or Irish states\". During a Commons debate on the Patten report, which was called by the Ulster Unionist leader, Mr Mandelson told MPs: \"I am not convinced that [the badge] needs to be entirely free of association with either tradition, as recommended.\" Mr Mandelson insisted that he had decided, \"after a lot of thought\", to accept Mr Patten's other main recommendation that the name of the RUC should be dropped in favour of the more neutral Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland secretary believes that a name change is a crucial element in encouraging nationalists to join the police. But in another gesture to unionists, Mr Mandelson announced that he would honour the RUC name \"in perpetuity\" through \"suitable initiatives\". These are likely to include a memorial garden to commemorate the 302 RUC officers killed during the troubles, and an RUC bursary scheme to fund police officers who want to attend the Bramshill training course in Britain. Mr Mandelson's gesture was designed to assuage the fears of unionists and to offer some encouragement to Mr Trimble as the government intensifies its efforts to resolve the disarmament deadlock. Ministers, who are hoping that the Ulster Unionist leader will agree to re-establish the power-sharing executive ahead of actual disarmament, believe that a gesture on the RUC may strengthen Mr Trimble's position against the hardliners within his party who are determined to wreck any agreement. However, Mr Mandelson's insistence on removing the RUC's name will anger Ulster Unionists, who voted last month to link Sinn Fein's admission to the power-sharing executive to retention of the force's name. Government sources indicated that the new cap could include a symbol of the crown. Another possibility, which Mr Mandelson hinted at in January, would be to include the George Cross, which the Queen awarded to the RUC last year to mark the force's bravery in fighting terrorism. Unionists were deeply angered by Mr Patten's recommendation because they believe that his proposal to remove the crown from the existing badge severely undermined Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom. Their anger was exacerbated because unionists believe that the existing RUC badge, which features a crown and a harp, represents both British and Irish traditions. Mr Trimble described the Patten proposal as a \"grievous insult\". Most Labour MPs support the Patten proposals, seeing them as an important way of encouraging nationalists to join the police. But former minister Frank Field voted against the government, saying more progress should be made on decommissioning before further concessions were offered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-07T10:52:08Z","webTitle":"Barclays closes swathe of branches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs","fields":{"headline":"Barclays closes swathe of branches","bodyText":"Up to 40,000 Barclays Bank customers across the country will today lose their local Branches. The bank is closing 171 branches, arguing they are uneconomic to run. Customers and politicians from all parties have condemned the move, which comes in the same week that the bank revealed top directors are in line for lucrative pay increases. People living in rural areas have complained the move will leave some communities with journeys of up to 20 miles to a bank. Barclays has confirmed that there would be some job losses among staff but said it did not have a precise figure. However, just hours before the closures were due to take effect, the company attempted to appease customers by announcing that a deal had been struck with the Post Office to offer some level of service in affected areas. Barclays retail banking director John Varley said that people using the 171 branches set to close would be able to carry out basic banking transactions at their local post-offices. He told the BBC's Watchdog programme: \"We have had a pilot with the Post Office in Cornwall to try to help customers where we are withdrawing from certain areas. \"After listening to our customers, we will have, within three weeks, in collaboration with the Post Office, arrangements in each of the areas where we are closing banks to help those customers cash cheques, pay in and withdraw money.\" While the move is unlikely to pacify those bitterly opposed to the closures, it might help calm the furious row ignited by environment minister Chris Mullin's comments that Barclays customers should \"vote with their feet\" over the closure plans. Barclays will now have 1,550 branches, compared with 2,000 in 1995 and more than 2,400 in 1991. Last year the bank made record profits of Â£2.4bn and last week it revealed it had paid its new chief executive, Matthew Barrett, Â£1.3m for just three months in the job. But Barclays argues it needs to move with the times, claiming that less than 40% of customers now use its branches because of an explosion in the use of cash machines, telephone and online banking. Company bosses are instead putting more resources into other branches and into telephone banking and online banking. Mr Varley said he apologised for the inconvenience caused to customers but insisted it was important for the bank to make a profit. \"There has been a sea change, a seismic change in the way in which customers choose to bank in the United Kingdom. \"If we ignore that then we will go out of business and this country is littered with the carcasses of businesses that have failed to move with the times. \"Look at NatWest, our biggest competitor - taken over. Look at Rover - going out of business. It is in the interest of Barclays, it is in the interests of Barclays' customers and its employees to be successful. \"If we are profitable, that is a good thing, not a bad thing.\" In an angry encounter with a presenter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Varley refused to confirm that directors were to get up to Â£40 million in bonuses. But he said Barclays \"had to compete for the best intellectual capital in the world\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-07T15:03:47Z","webTitle":"Bank checks out to cash in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/07/ruralaffairs.comment","fields":{"headline":"Bank checks out to cash in","bodyText":"Barclays Bank has a snazzy website listing all its wonderful services: investments, loans, offshore accounts and so on. You can even look up your nearest branch - whoops, sorry, no you can't. That page, understandably I suppose, is being rebuilt, with 171 locations electronically Tippexed out. Still, there is a useful press release pointing out that soon, very soon, Barclays account holders who no longer have a branch within easy reach will be offered basic services - cheque encashment, paying in, that sort of thing - at their local Post Office. Good-oh, I thought, with a sigh of relief - until I tried to find out where my local Post Office is. I went to the equally snazzy website of Post Office Counters and, sure enough, there was a helpful page where I could type in my postcode and hey presto! It tells me my nearest Post Offices are in Spelsbury, Kingham, and Adlestrop; all a 'handy' five miles away (or slightly less). But in actual fact, those are not my nearest Post Offices at all. My nearest one is five minutes' toddle away, in the middle of Chipping Norton (a couple of doors away from the (surviving) branch of Barclays, in fact). My point is this: website access to vital services is not, yet, quite all that it's cracked up to be. And yet Barclays would have us believe that we don't really need all those branches cluttering up the rural landscape, when we can simply log on and click. That argument is, at best, fatuous. Three-quarters of the nation has no access to the internet. And even for those who have access, there will be a substantial proportion for whom over-the-counter banking will remain essential. Nowhere is that more true than in the countryside, where basic services, both public and private, are under relentless threat. Bank closures are part of a dismal pattern of rural atrophy. Village schools, shops, Post Offices, and public transport have all been whittled away. That may not be much of a deal for the new class of country dwellers, with their Range Rovers and converted barns. But for true locals, it is a disaster. What about the old, the poor, and those who need help with their finances? Does Barclays really believe that it can service such customers through automated screens or automatons in call centres? Of course it doesn't. The fact is, the bank wants rid of such awkward, low-return custom. It wants to be shot of all that messy real estate, staffed by real people who insist on being paid real money. Barclays retail banking director John Varley, in his spirited bid to become Media Prat of the Year on this morning's Today programme, delivered the ritual assurance that rural bank customers would be able to use the Post Office network to carry out their business. Balderdash! The Post Office option is a slow, truncated version of a proper banking service, dreamed up by Barclays when it realised it was drifting into a public relations nightmare. And, although Mr Varley may not have heard about it, the government is about to sabotage the rural Post Office network, by diverting pension and benefit payments to the very banks which are closing down their rural branches. Varley was at least refreshingly honest about the bank's real motive, which is to make barrowloads of dosh - and to hell with the customers. Barclays has closed nearly 1,000 branches in the past decade and sacked God knows how many thousand staff. Last year it made record profits of Â£2.4bn. \"There has been a sea change, a seismic change, in the way in which customers choose to bank in the United Kingdom,\" said Mr Varley.

John Humphrys: It is an extraordinary way to run a bank, isn't it, Mr Varley? You close all these branches and then you award yourself potentially massive, massive amounts of money. John Varley: Well, I think there is a profound change in the way customers are banking in the United Kingdom. JH: So that isn't anything to do with you awarding yourself lots of money, is it? JV: Well, I'm here to talk about branch closures. JH: Oh, you're not here to talk about the whole picture? JV: I'm here to talk about branch closures. I'm also happy to talk about the importance of organisations such as Barclays being profitable. JH: In order for you to get massive, massive bonuses. Is that not a factor in this? JV: It isn't a factor in this. Profits are good because profits enable successful industries to invest, invest on behalf of customers, to offer their people good employment prospects. The profits of Barclays are owned by pension funds for the most part, representing pensioners all round the United Kingdom. So, if Barclays is successful, that's good for all its stakeholders. JH: It's especially good for you, though, isn't it? You personally would pick up Â£15m if all goes well. JV: Well, that's an assertion, an allegation you're making which I deny. JH: When people come into this programme, they normally answer the questions that are relevant and this is a relevant question because you are closing these branches to be more profitable. And most people would say a perfectly acceptable reason, but one thing you will do with the money you save on this is pay yourselves very large amounts, including the man who runs the bank potentially Â£40m, and yourself Â£15m. JV: I reject those numbers. JH: What are the accurate numbers? JV: And I reject that assertion. We're closing these branches because we need to redirect resource into upgrading other branches, integrating better telephone banking and online banking, into cash machines. JH: But a lot of the money is going to go in very large bonuses and share options to people like yourself who run the bank. People say fine, if you run a good business, you're entitled to be properly remunerated, but Â£40m for the man who runs the bank? Â£15m for yourself? And if those aren't the right figures, tell me what are the right figures and I'll change them. JV: Provided there are common interests between Barclays shareholders and the management of Barclays then it is good that the management of Barclays should be incentivised. JH: Forty million quid? JV: If we're operating, as we are, in an intensely competitive industry, then it is right that when Barclays seeks a new chief executive that it should go to one of the best managers in the world and Matt Barrett is one of those. JH: Â£40m worth of management? JV: I haven't accepted those numbers... We have to compete for the best intellectual capital in the world...

The company is creating an online auction site to sell spare flights on Virgin planes, holidays and products such as mobile phones. The site will allow users to buy and sell collectibles and memorabilia, similar to the service by online auctioneer eBay. An announcement is expected in the next couple of months. The move marks a shift in emphasis for the troubled Virgin group, which is turning its focus to the Internet and away from divisions which have failed to perform. Last week Virgin announced it was to stop selling its branded clothing in the UK and that Virgin Express, its low-cost airline, made a loss last year. The V2 record label and Our Price stores have also required multimillion- pound injections. Developing Virgin's powerful consumer brand on the Internet - using some of the Â£400 million the company made from the sale of its 49 per cent stake in its airline - makes sense. As Virgin Net is one of the most popular Internet ser vices in the UK, the company's online expansion plans represent a new challenge for companies like Lastminute and QXL. Lastminute sells late holidays and gifts, while QXL specialises in auctioning bulk orders of goods and services. Last week Lastminute's share price continued to depress investors. QXL, meanwhile, surged 128 per cent on Thursday alone as a wealth of analysts expressed faith in the stock and the company's ability to consolidate the fragmented online auction market. The Virgin site is being built by US technology firm FairMarket, which also built the auction service for FiredUp.com, the online firm owned by News Corp. The system monitors users' instructions so that it can offer a more personalised service. 'It learns what they buy, it gives Virgin the ability to market to its customers,' said Lou Shipley, president of FairMarket. 'Over time, we would expect to get all of their products from phones to excess plane seats on the site. They'll start with one set of auction products and then they'll expand the range from there.' Link-up with London Electricity to sell energy over the Internet Virgin is finalising a deal with French-owned London Electricity to sell energy over the Internet. The joint venture, which is majority-owned by Virgin, will see London selling electricity and gas across the United Kingdom under the Virgin Energy brand. The final details about exact equity stakes are still being hammered out, but an announcement should come some time within the next two weeks. Virgin has talked to a number of utilities about launching its energy brand, and London Electricity is thought to have pipped Eastern Energy, owned by the American giant TXU, and Scottish &amp; Southern Energy to the finishing post. The site is due to be launched in the summer, with Virgin aiming to add other services, including telecoms, at a later stage. Virgin is entering the utilities market as other players such as npower, the former National power, Centrica and Scottish Power expand their web-based operations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/apr/09/observerescapesection","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-09T17:09:53Z","webTitle":"Warriors hunt for a fairer future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/apr/09/observerescapesection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/apr/09/observerescapesection","fields":{"headline":"Warriors hunt for a fairer future","bodyText":"'It's either a bushbaby or a leopard,' said Paul, the blond safari guide, who knew what he was talking about. I balanced precariously on the top of the Toyota Landcruiser as he sent a searchlight slicing throught the eerie darkness of the African bush. The powerful beam landed on scrub that exploded into brightness. Several pairs of stars seemed to have dropped down to it from the sky; the eyes of anxious animals, staring at us, the intruders. One pair, ruby-red, shone out hypnotically. 'They're the only two animals with red eyes,' explained Paul. Maritei, a Masai warrior who wrapped his pendulous earlobes over the tops of his ears, drove us forward when a giraffe strode in slow motion out of the blackness into view, answering the question. No giraffe would go near a leopard. It can often be easier to see animals at night rather than day in Eselenkei conservation area, an expanse of Masai tribal land in the shadow of snow-topped Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain and the highest stand-alone mountain in the world. During the day the animals, unused to humans, hide in the thickets. At night, their reflective eyes give them away. At night every tree comes to life. Which was not a comforting thought for me as we drove back to the tents to sleep. We weren't protected by any wooden fences, electrified wires or rangers on watch with guns. The tents are just there, pitched in a clearing in the middle of the bush. As I lay in my bed there was nothing between me and any leopard but some canvas and a crisp white sheet. Earlier, while eating dinner, we had heard the howl of a wandering hyena. The previous night elephants had passed by, leaving nothing but droppings. This was camping al fresco, as close to African nature as you can get. And sometimes closer than you would wish. Paul regaled me with campfire tales about how he once took a safari on the other side of Kenya and two guests were trapped in their tent by a buffalo sleeping outside who refused to move. Buffalo - grouchy at the best of times - do not like being woken up. On another trip, people stayed up all night as lions wandered between the tents engaging in a roaring contest. 'People were a little shaken,' admitted Paul. I was grateful that Eselenkei is not as packed with animals as Kenya's more famous safari parks. The scarcity of lions means it is safe to walk about Eselenkei. Or so I was assured. You can wonder about and see lots of giraffe and ostrich, zebra and Thompson's gazelle, but no big cats. As we trooped up a dried-up river bed, Paul pointed out giraffe prints and piles of porcupine droppings. He told me how the river bed, with its steep sides, was the perfect location for a flash flood, where you hear the roar of trees being pulled down only seconds before a wall of water hits you. He confessed he hadn't checked the weather forecast before we left but assured me it was the wrong season for it. Farther along we saw a hyena lair with holes full of animal bones, and the dried out waterhole where the zebra like to roll about in the dirt. Owned by the Masai, rather than the government, Eselenkei is a private reserve. It's 70 square kilometres and we were the only guests. There's an intimacy with nature that is hard to catch in other parks, where a truck of snapping tourists will drive up alongside you as soon as you've spotted anything interesting. But you won't see the big animals. For that, we drove an hour down a shifting dirt track, across the parched terrain, in the direction of Kilimanjaro. The melting snow and the rain pour down the mountain to make Amboseli Park a huge oasis, a splash of year-round green in the browns of southern Kenya. Above you, wherever you are in the park, towers Kilimanjaro like a sentinel, its snow a strange sight just a hundred miles south of the Equator. The park is improbably teeming with buffalo, zebra, antelope, and wallowing hippos. But the elephants are the unmistakable stars of Amboseli. Small, large, and super-large, they are swarming all over the verdant park, more than a thousand of them in total. The celebrated elephantologist Cynthia Moss lives in a camp in Amboseli, dubbed the Kingdom of the Elephant. They stroll in families across the grass plains, they loll in the water ponds, they wade out to islands to sunbathe, they frolic in the marshes, Kili towering above them. Which for me was wonderful. Far more than any other safari animal, elephants have character, social complexity, and a sense of a tale to tell. Most safari animals don't actually do that much, but sit there or stand there and you think after a while, what now? I can stare at elephants for hours. At one point we were surrounded by around 200. Cute little ones, just a few months old, nuzzled up to their mothers; two amorous adults entwined their trunks and seemed to massage each other. Two males had a stand-off, one advancing slowly, the other backing away step by step. The lone bulls wandered about, with careworn tatty ears and tusks fractured in fighting. In Zimbabwe, where they cull elephants to control their numbers, they have learned how intelligent, social, and almost human they are. If you don't kill all the members of a family group, the survivors will turn into problem elephants. Not just distrustful of man, and vengeful, but they will warn other elephants of what man has done. Zimbabwe rangers have learned they must cull the entire family together, making sure that not one elephant escapes to cause trouble and warn others. Amboseli is great for tourists but it has not been as good for the Masai. The national park was carved out of their land and not only have they lost the watering rights for their cattle - except during drought - but they have received little of the tourist revenues that it brings (this ends up in the pockets of corrupt government Ministers). Until now, the Masai have sought revenge in a traditional manner: spearing wildlife. For a people proud of their warrior traditions and keen to prove their hunting skills, nothing beats killing a lion. Earn your spurs and get back at the park authorities at the same time. Amboseli is full of antelope and zebra but has virtually no big cats. But now one branch of the Masai - the Kisongo - have adopted the American adage: don't get mad, get even. The result, after years of planning and politics with the group ranch committee, the equivalent of the local council, is Eselenkei conservation area. It is a wildlife park on their land, but this time it's on their terms. It nestles up to Amboseli, in the so-called 'dispersal area', and during the rainy season much of Amboseli's wildlife saunters through. Roads have been painfully cleared by hand, using just farm tools. Waterholes have been dug to make sure the wildlife stays there once the rainy season ends. 'Water is a magnet. The animals will stay where the water is,' said Paul. The accommodation tents have been put up in a clearing in the middle of the conservation area. These aren't your usual camping-in-Devon tents. Indeed, they're not even the usual luxury safari tents. Put it like this: these are tents with flush toilets. They have hot showers, copper basins, wooden wardrobes, comfortable beds and solar-powered electric lights. Everything in the camp is 'low impact': take it all down and you'd never know there'd been a camp there. There's a mess tent and the food is cooked for you but, perhaps fortunately, it is not traditional Masai fare. I didn't need to decline politely the traditional Masai appetiser of cows' milk with fresh blood. Having milked the cows, the Masai then tap a neck vein for a pint or two of blood. (Apparantly it's a favourite with growing young men and pregnant women.) Instead, on the first night I had roast chicken and potatoes with mange-tout and on the second a Greek version of lasagne. I felt like a relic from colonial White Mischief days, sitting at a table in the middle of the bush, surrounded by animal sounds, sipping French red wine and eating a traditional English roast served to me by a usually semi-nomadic Masai warrior wearing his traditional red robes, covered from earlobe to ankle in multicoloured beaded jewellery, sword dangling at his side. The costumes aren't put on for the tourists: it is just the way they dress. Jeans and T-shirts have yet to make their mark. Their earlobes are hugely distended from dangling large objects in them. On their cheeks they have little circular scars where they were branded with burning rope as toddlers to ward off eye disease. As I tucked into roast chicken, I was almost overwhelmed by Western liberal guilt. My presence was turning a warrior into a waiter, making a proud person servile. Wouldn't contact with all the tourists on their tribal land destroy their culture? Such concerns were laid to rest by the remarkable Emmanuel Onetu, officially the conservation manager of Eselenkei, unofficially the cultural liaison officer, and, as he calls himself proudly, the 'community mobiliser'. He grew up in a traditional cow-dung hut, but was educated to O-level and is now chairman of the local school. He lives in a wood and corrugated steel hut and, quite startlingly in the bush, he has a telephone. He has been the driving force behind Eselenkei, working with Jake Grieves-Cook, founder of the travel company Tropical Places. Emmanuel has had to work hard to ensure that all 3,000 people on the group ranch understand what the project is about, and give it their support. The involvement of a white man raised suspicions that they were going to be taken advantage of, but after decades of sending tourists to Kenya, Grieves-Cook is keen to put something back in to the community. It is a joint venture between him and the Kisongo group ranch. The Kisongo Masai have agreed not to kill the wildlife for the sake of it. In Eselenkei there is no spearing or snaring. Emmanuel has even persuaded Masai from farther afield to cut down on the killing. 'We have all this nature and wildlife and we want to share it. We are proud of it,' said Emmanuel. 'We are learning about conservation.' Emmanuel talks almost messianically about the benefits of the project. The Masai get a lease fee for the conservation area, as well as a bed-night fee and an entrance fee for every tourist. There are also 26 Masai employed in the upkeep of the conservation area. It's the first paid job they have had. Emmanuel explains that it is their chance to get some of the financial benefits from tourism, to help them with the most basic things. 'We want to generate income, so we can send our children to school and pay for health care.' He showed me the local school, which has 270 pupils, many of whom have to walk three hours there and three hours back each day. They have virtually no books but plenty of enthusiasm. They want to turn the wooden classrooms into brick ones, but first they have a more critical problem: getting water. The pump at the school borehole has broken, and, of course, with no water the teachers cannot wash, or drink, or cook for themselves or the children. Revenues from Eselenkei tourists will mean that they can mend the water pump, rather than close the school. 'Without education, nothing can happen. Without education you have no future,' said Emanuel, who believes conservation is the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2000/apr/10/artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-10T01:55:20Z","webTitle":"Look what's landed in Brum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/apr/10/artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2000/apr/10/artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Look what's landed in Brum","bodyText":"List six architectural landmarks in central Birmingham (readers from the West Midlands are excluded from this part of the article). The Rotunda. The Town Hall. Spaghetti Junction. St Chad's by Pugin - the first Roman Catholic cathedral built since the Reformation. And, erm, the aqueduct? I'm sure there's an aqueduct somewhere between Birmingham and the dams of the Elan Valley. I'm not trying to be cynical. Despite a lacing of fascinating Georgian and Victorian buildings, and brave attempts to make its canals into new urban arteries and its central squares hotbeds of new public art, Birmingham's architecture remains strangely unmemorable. The centre, the Bull Ring, was blitzed in the war and then rebuilt dismally, save for the Rotunda, and is being rebuilt again in a trashy, flashy way, as if the city were determined to be known for its philistinism. Help, however, is at hand from an unlikely source: Future Systems, the studio of radical architects fronted by Amanda Levete and Jan Kaplicky, who designed the gloriously original new press pavilion at Lord's cricket ground in London. Future Systems has been commissioned by Selfridges to design its new Birmingham store as part of the Bull Ring redevelopment. Work begins this autumn, and should be completed in 2002. What it will offer Birmingham, aside from sophisticated shopping, is what we have learned to call a \"landmark\" building, one that cannot be missed and helps define the image of a city centre. This martian spaceship-like building will be visible from the exit of Birmingham New Street, one of Britain's most wilfully banal railway stations. It is guaranteed to catch the eye of locals and visitors alike: a soft, organic form billowing seductively above the rooftops of existing shops and offices and acting as a foil to the spire of St Martin's church. Central Birmingham is being remodelled along two new principal streets - one of which will be covered and will form part of a massive new shopping mall. This will house the main entrance to the Selfridges store. Apart from this, the building will be accessible only by a pedestrian bridge designed by Future Systems, leading from a multi-storey car park. The blue store will thus help define the new-look Birmingham. It makes sense that this image will be dominated by modern buildings that are, effectively, air-conditioned covered markets, for the city has always been a great centre for getting and spending. It's a little sad, though, because while Birmingham is better known today for its conferences and summit meetings, its trade shows and its orchestra, it was also the working home of Boulton and Watt (and thus the steam engine); of Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen; and John Baskerville and his peerless typeface. Here, too, the X-ray was discovered, together with cotton wool and Cadbury's Creme Eggs. If New York is the Big Apple, Birmingham is the Mountainous Chocolate Egg. In designing Selfridges, however, Future Systems has reconciled commerce, art and science in a building that reflects many of this landlocked city's virtues and inventions. The design is a fairly simple five-floor building penetrated by two amoeba-shaped atria and topped with a curvaceous roof-top garden and an ultra-modern restaurant. What makes the building so distinctive is its skin, a kind of architectural chain-mail, which will flow sinuously around the building. This is to be made from thousands of ceramic or coloured-aluminium discs in many shades of blue. The new Selfridges will seem to be windowless, except for one large eye-window that peers out from behind the chain-mail and another that glides open and leads on to a balcony. If the building is all but hermetically sealed, this is because the area it is sited in is really no place to walk. The Bull Ring area is a kingdom for cars, with some of the fastest urban traffic in Europe. Selfridges' chain-mail, says Kaplicky, was inspired by the metal fabrics devised by fashion designer Paco Rabanne, who, incidentally, trained for 12 years as an architect. The clever thing about this second skin is that it allows a loose fit over the building. If an additional curve were required in the building's jellyfish-like profile, it would be easy to add some more discs curving up and over it. As a result, the building will appear to be softly structured, a design that should appeal across the board. It is so distinctive, however, that, in theory at least, Selfridges agrees with Levete and Kaplicky that the store will need no name. Everyone will know it is Selfridges as surely as shoppers do the great neo-classical store in London's Oxford Street. While the architects will be able to shape the main restaurant and cafes, what they cannot do is control the shops inside the new store. These will be given over to individual brands and outlets, each with its house style - from the preppy New England look of Ralph Lauren to the slick European modern of Giorgio Armani. The store will not have a conventional entrance. Instead of a wall of glass interrupted with a row of doors, customers will enter through nothing more than a screen of steel mesh, inspired again by the fabrics of Paco Rabanne. Security is hardly a problem inside these new malls: they seem to boast more CCTV cameras per square foot than the headquarters of the CIA. If we must have these giant shops, they should at least be interesting as works of architecture. Future Systems has pulled off the trick, doing for Birmingham what Sir John Burnet did 90 years ago for London's Oxford Street with his original Selfridges store - a wonderful steel-framed structure that remains the one great building in a mile-long corridor of commercial schlock. Can you name five others?"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/10/britishidentity.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-10T12:24:44Z","webTitle":"North-south divide gapes ever wider","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/10/britishidentity.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/10/britishidentity.comment","fields":{"headline":"North-south divide gapes ever wider","bodyText":"It's Kilfoyle's revenge. Since the Liverpool MP resigned in January a succession of reports and surveys have confirmed that there are hard, enduring and structural differences in the prosperity of the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Cardiff report on competitiveness, released today, is the latest. What distinguishes it - and probably makes it all the more dismaying to read in Manchester, Swansea or Gateshead - is its future orientation. The northern regions, Wales and Northern Ireland are losing out in precisely those technologies and areas of knowledge from which the jobs and incomes of the 21st century are to come. Peter Kilfoyle accused the Blair government of neglecting its \"heartlands\" - the parts of the United Kingdom from which it draws its traditional support. Blair's response was that within every region there are successful towns. He is right but it is a politically weak answer. The poverty and lack of opportunity on Merseyside and Tyneside are too physically apparent to be wished away by reference to growth in Chester or Newcastle's undoubtedly successful revival as a tourist destination. What Kilfoyle has managed to do is put \"regional policy\" back on the map. He has revived an issue that had been consistently downgraded during the Tory era, on which Labour too had been none too keen when it took office. Whitehall is now hurriedly listing all the ways in which regional assistance is provided and Blair has become a convert to the possibility of transforming John Prescott's regional development agencies into embryonic democratic assemblies, allowing the regions to assert themselves. Yet the Cardiff report is a chilling reminder of the size of the gap between north and south. Central intervention on a huge scale is going to be needed to boost productivity and introduce the new communications technology into the economic bases of Wales, Yorkshire, Humberside and the northeast. The report also shows that the government is going to have to swim against the economic tide which is washing so luxuriously around London's towers. But there are ways in which the government can channel investment: if it invests in skills and infrastructure even the most southern-oriented company directors can be persuaded to relocate or set up a new shop in the north. First, however, the government is going to have to concede the truth of the Kilfoyle critique. Labour's heartlands are suffering and only the most energetic revival of regional subsidy is going to help."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/apr/11/jonathanwatts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-11T01:03:16Z","webTitle":"Two Koreas to meet after 55 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/11/jonathanwatts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/apr/11/jonathanwatts","fields":{"headline":"Two Koreas to meet after 55 years","bodyText":"North and South Korea took a historic step towards resolving the world's last major cold war conflict yesterday with the announcement of their first bilateral summit since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945. Washington, Beijing and Tokyo welcomed the move as the best chance for peace on the peninsula since the Korean war of 1950-53, but diplomatic experts said many obstacles lie ahead on the road towards unification. In an unprecedented joint declaration, the two sides said that the president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, would meet his North Korea counterpart, Kim Jong-il, for talks in Pyongyang from June 10-12. The main item on the agenda will be economic aid for the communist North, where the infrastructure is in ruins and millions are thought to be starving as a result of natural disasters and a failed government policy of economic self-sufficiency. The two Kims will also discuss how to reunite families that were split during the Korean war - the cold war's most bloody conflict - during which more than 3m people were killed. Since the 1953 armistice, the two sides have never signed a peace treaty. Forty-seven years later, they remain technically at war, divided at the 38th parallel by the most heavily fortified border in the world. Timed just three days before a general election in South Korea, the summit announcement is a stunning political coup for Kim Dae-jung, who has gone further than any other previous leader in Seoul to try to coax the reclusive and aggressive north out of its shell. Despite domestic political criticism and military provocation by Pyongyang, his \"sunshine policy\" of engagement has seen a four-fold increase in visits across the border in the past two years. Bilateral trade hit a record high last year of $333m (Â£211m) and passenger cruises to the Mt Kumgang resort in the North have attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists. Kim Dae-jung said the June meeting would take relations to a new level. \"The agreement is an opportunity for bringing development and prosperity to the nation and ensuring hope for peace on the Korean peninsula,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. It would also mark the debut on the world stage of Kim Jong-il; the North's mysterious \"Dear Leader\" has not held a summit meeting since taking power after his father's death six years ago. Although North Korean news agencies claim that flowers bloom when the 58-year-old \"Renaissance Man\" walks by, he has rarely been seen in public or on television. The breakthrough comes amid the most concerted international effort in history to persuade the \"hermit kingdom\" to open up. Taking a lead from Kim Dae-jung, the US, Japan and Europe have increased diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, while offering increased economic aid in return for improved North-South ties in Korea. China - the North's most important ally - has also played a key role by hosting unofficial talks between the two sides. The Chinese foreign ministry said it welcomed and supported the summit plan. \"We have always advocated the belief that both sides on the Korean peninsula should improve relations through dialogue aimed at reconciliation and ultimately reunification,\" the ministry said in a statement. Given Pyongyang's provocative negotiating tactics in the past and the complex range of issues dividing the two sides - most notably the future of the 37,000 US troops in the south - a successful conclusion of the talks is far from certain. Professor Kim Ki-jung of Yonsei University said sudden reunification was unlikely. \"The summit meeting is the beginning of what will be a very long and time-consuming process,\" he said. \"The most important first step will be to build confidence after all the years of mutual distrust.\" In Seoul, the response was mixed. Optimism about prospects for trade helped to push the stock market up by almost 4%, but members of the opposition Grand National party accused the president of cynical electioneering. The feeling among the city's population, however, was muted. \"I cannot get excited about this announcement at all,\" said Ahn Soo-jeong, a film industry worker. \"We've seen plans like this dashed before, so it is best not to have high expectations.\" In contrast, supporters of the Pyongyang regime were jubilant. \"This is an epochal step towards realising the peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula,\" said So Chung-on, spokesman for the 400,00 North Korean residents in Japan. \"Now that the will on both sides is there, reunification is not so far away.\" Decades of conflict â¢1945 Second world war ends 35 years of Japanese colonial rule.

The report, by the Commons defence committee, is so studded with asterisks that much of the evidence provided by the MoD is rendered meaningless.

Labour MPs of the Kilfoyle, Doug Henderson stripe look like winning the argument. The likelihood of their winning the war - and securing a major shift in policy and resources northwards - is lessened by the strength of the cynical/psephological argument. It says that even if Labour supporters stay at home in their droves in Gateshead, Bootle or Glamorgan, the cushion of huge Labour majorities there will hold up. More important for the party's future is the south, where Labour won against the historical odds in 1997. But even a government with only a residual commitment to equality must find this argument hard to sustain. North-south remains a proxy for the system's inegalitarianism and cannot be winked at. National indices are dragged down by regional underperformance. Yes, unemployment is well down, even in Mr Kilfoyle's Merseyside - though conventional definitions exclude those who have withdrawn from the labour market. The \"northern\" economy shows signs of rosy health at sub-regional level in the cities of Leeds or Manchester. Newcastle upon Tyne is reinventing itself. But persisting imbalance in economic (and social) prospects between the south and east of England and most of the rest of the United Kingdom is too stark. A new report on competitiveness in the regions compiled by Robert Huggins of the University of Cardiff shows how the disparity will grow as capital and employment moves to e-business. One of his indicators is the proportion of firms which are \"knowledge-based\", which these days as good as means future-proofed. If the south-east is 30% above the UK average, Yorkshire and Humberside is at 34% below and Wales scores two-thirds of the average. Such uneven development demands active government intervention - whether it is on the Third Way script or not. Because regional assistance has such a long pedigree it gets characterised - for example by the chancellor - as old Labour interventionism. There is a lot to be said against profligate support for manufacturing investment, subsidising branch plants and industries in decline - though the fact that Longbridge and Harland and Wolf are mass employers makes sudden abandonment of support politically difficult. Call centres could be the next sector to fall. But subsidy can work. The remarkable success of the Irish Republic in recent years proves that being on the geographical edge is not itself an obstacle to attracting external investment. Yet the evidence favours indigenous growth based on small and medium enterprise and the enrichment of a region's human capital. Until school attainment rates are raised and mass higher education arrives in the back streets of Sunderland and Sefton cruel regional disparities will persist. Tony Blair has lately warmed to the devolution of political decision-making within England - oddly late in the day for a north-eastern MP. His remarks about the Alun Michael-Rhodri Morgan affair reported at the weekend may be a sign of a lesson painfully learned.

It is a reasonable bet that the words \"Council of Europe\" will not pass anyone's lips. References to \"Mrs Robinson\" may even be taken to refer to Kathleen Turner's current role on the London stage. But when Mr Putin meets the prime minister and other government ministers, should not someone feel some embarrassment for the alacrity with which Mr Putin is being received in London after an election campaign which exploited the brutality of the Russian onslaught in Chechnya? Will no one ask why it is that the Council of Europe, not renowned for stern action, should have put Russia on notice of suspension for its callous disregard of civilian lives in Chechnya? Will anyone question the fact that Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, should have humiliated the UN's own Mrs Robinson by denying her the access to which her office as high commissioner for human rights entitled her? Will no one argue that when it comes to human rights it is not the rhetoric which counts but the reality? None of this is to deny that Russia should be a focus of British foreign policy; or that its stability is essential for the security of Europe; nor that in the end it played an important part in the settlement in Kosovo. But a foreign policy with an \"ethical dimension\" cannot ignore the indiscriminate use of military force such as Mr Putin presided over in Chechnya. Chechen terrorists and rebels have done some terrible things, but countries whose leaders aspire to be received in the United Kingdom should not be lightly excused the use of such disproportionate force. Men, women and children are not the legitimate targets of military operations whose avowed purpose is counter terrorism. When serious allegations are made by respected organisations, governments which claim a commitment to human rights have a duty to investigate and if necessary put perpetrators on trial. When the UN high commissioner came to call, the Putin government had a duty to afford her every assistance. Some argue that so urgent are Britain's interests in relation to Russia that \"engagement\" is necessary, and there is force in that argument. But has anyone thought how Mr Putin's early invitation to London will be seen in Moscow? No matter how many qualifications, caveats, or conditions, the visit will be seen as an endorsement of the policy towards Chechnya which he has pursued with such ruthless determination. It will also reinforce the humiliation handed out to Mary Robinson. If the Council of Europe proceeds to suspension how will our alacrity look to our European allies? Even if \"critical engagement\" has replaced \"ethical dimension\", that is still no basis for this precipitate visit. Here is a \"critical\" approach to Russia, but one which recognises the primacy of human rights and does not confer unqualified approval. We recognise your importance in the world. You have the nuclear weapons and the influence to prove it. Europe will not be secure unless you feel secure. Your internal stability depends very heavily on economic progress. We understand your concerns about Nato and about the American proposal for a missile defence system for which they may be prepared to breach the ABM treaty. We can help with the economy but you must root out corruption and curtail the activities of the Mafia. There is not likely to be any further enlargement of Nato for some time. Nato is still digesting the three who joined last year. We in the UK are concerned about the ABM treaty and will do our best to persuade America not to do anything which breaches it, or at the very least to offer you the technology so that your national interests are not prejudiced and you do not feel the need to abandon any hopes of nuclear reductions. But human rights are important to us - we are about to adopt the European Convention into English law -and you cannot expect the kind of full partnership which would benefit us both unless you show a regard for them. You can do that immediately by reining in the brutality in Chechnya and by conducting your own investigations into abuses with sufficient transparency as to satisfy Mary Robinson, and sufficient regard for the rule of law as to put people on trial if it is justified to do so. There is the proper basis for a constructive relationship, and when the deeds of both of us match our undertakings then we can see about a trip to London and the Palace. But not before.

Born in Swansea, the son of a shop steward - from whom he derived his concern for social justice - Walters was educated at Gowerton boys' grammar school and the London School of Economics. After briefly considering a stage career, in 1957 he entered ordination training at Ripon Hall, Oxford. Then came a curacy in Swansea, and in 1962 Walters migrated to England, where two incumbencies in industrial areas were followed by his appointment in 1974 as diocesan missioner in the Salisbury diocese. The rural composition of Wiltshire and Dorset contrasted with the settings in which he had hitherto worked, but for nine years he threw himself into the promotion of the Church's mission in country parishes. His sharp mind and incisive insights were welcomed at the meetings of the bishop's staff; and he developed a penchant for information technology. In 1983, he was summoned to Liverpool, to succeed Edward Patey as dean. A lesser spirit might well have been daunted both by the vastness of Giles Gilbert Scott's cathedral and by the condition of Liverpool at the time. But Walters, supported by his superb wife Joan, whose radical convictions matched his own, had a clear vision of what could be brought about both within the cathedral and beyond its walls. He blew into the cathedral like a rushing, mighty wind. He enhanced the worship and the music and developed its facilities, giving it a refectory and a shop and making it attractive as a conference venue. He was concerned deeply with its spiritual dimension. He did not pursue his wider projects to the detriment of his primary responsibility. But Walters could not be confined by the cathedral walls. His theology was based on the kingdom of God, and that drove his commitment to the city of Liverpool as a whole and the conditions of its citizens' lives. He was fortunate to have in David Sheppard a bishop who shared his priorities. When Walters came to the cathedral, there was an expanse of derelict land adjacent to it. He saw his chance and embarked upon what were to become major schemes of development. The waste land was transformed, with the building of Queen's Walk and the John Moores University media studies block, which was named the Dean Walters Building in his honour. There was also the creation of housing for students, for cathedral clergy and staff and, most important of all, public housing. This last was his contribution to the effort to reinstate inner-city living in Liverpool. It was calculated that Walters was associated with developments worth, in total, some Â£230m. By any standards, it was an enormous achievement. How did he do it? He saw that the prominence of the cathedral gave its dean some real power. He had great charm and great powers of persuasion, and so was able to draw others to follow his vision and to cooperate in a creative way for the common good. While some saw him as an ecclesiastical entrepreneur, those who worked closely with him soon became aware that his promotion of development sprang from deep theological convictions and that God was at the centre for him. Beyond any doubt, he left his mark upon many areas of the life of both cathedral and city, which was recognised by the award of an OBE in 1994. His final years were beset by a prolonged struggle against cancer. By a great exertion of will, and with the aid of two sticks, he managed to install James Jones as Bishop of Liverpool in 1999, his last act in the cathedral. His final days were marked by great serenity and by much gentleness and kindness to those around him. He will long be remembered and honoured in Liverpool and in the hearts of his many friends. He is survived by his wife and two sons. â¢ Rhys Derrick Chamberlain Walters, priest, born 10 March 1932; died 5 April 2000 â¢ This article was amended on 27 September 2011, when the name and date details were added at the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/apr/14/3","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-14T00:02:53Z","webTitle":"Going ape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/14/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/apr/14/3","fields":{"headline":"Going ape","bodyText":"Three years before King Kong, there was Ingagi. It was a real-life, documentary account in 1930 of an expedition into the Belgian Congo by somebody called Sir Herbert Winstead of London. Ingagi packed the US motion-picture halls. \"Has the Ape Man been Found?\" ran the ads in Chicago. \"Gorillas! Wild Women! Apparently Half Ape! Half Human!\" Crowds came especially for the last 10 minutes of the film, which purported to show a tribal sacrifice of a woman by native Africans to a 600lb gorilla. Variety reported that the \"suggestiveness\" of gorilla scenes guaranteed Ingagi a \"sure box office\". Congo Pictures Ltd sold the rights to RKO after the film grossed $23,000 in a week at one San Francisco cinema. The film offended American naturalists and the Hays Office - not because of the sexual innuendo or bestiality but because the gorilla scenes were quite obviously a compilation of stock orang-utan footage and a man in a gorilla suit. The film was faked at a zoo in California and the actresses were girls in what the showbiz trade used to call \"blackface\". The Chicago Tribune thought the cinematography so awful that it just had to be \"the real thing and not a staged adventure\". Gregg Mitman, a US science historian, tells the story in a new book called Reel Nature, which makes it quite clear: violence and sex win every time, and fakes beat reality any day. Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack of RKO got the message of Ingagi, hired an actress called Fay Wray and an even bigger gorilla suit and set to work on the \"most awesome thriller of all time\". In 1933, they sold King Kong as fiction. But gorilla tactics began long before Ingagi. The first wildlife documentary was called Roosevelt in Africa. Made in 1910, it shows the great ex-president and naturalist Theodore Roose-velt planting a tree in Kenya, watching giraffes and hippos at play and the courtship dance of a bird. There is a scene with a serval cat, but the lion footage had to be spliced in from a still taken with a flashlight. It didn't play in Peoria. People expected to see Teddy the white hunter \"slaughtering lions and tigers and wallowing in their gore\". A Chicago entrepreneur called Selig went one better. He got someone to impersonate Roosevelt, faked a scene of a lion being shot and carried away by native porters, and had a success on his hands. \"There is no doubt about this lion,\" said the critic of Moving Picture World. \"He stalks majestically about the picture, thus enabling an audience to realise how a lion would look, not on the warpath, but peaceably ambling about among natural surroundings.\" That's natural history movies for you. Show life as it is, and the punters yawn. Fake some drama and you have a winner on your hands. The ultimate natural history movie - well, it is scripted and carefully cast and $800m was spent on the sound stage - is Disney's Animal Kingdom, in Florida. There, with the help of 1,000 animals, 100,000 transplanted trees and some African music on the loudspeakers, Disney's \"imagineers\" have synthesised the African veldt on the Florida flatlands: nature, this time round, as drama. The actors couldn't get more authentic; the theatre itself is the fantasy. How the wildlife documentary got from Roosevelt to Disneyworld is a story of charlatans, hucksters, crooks, imaginative cameramen, brilliant zoology and shameless appeal to the sex and violence of life as cinema audiences have grown to expect it to be. Mitman, of the University of Oklahoma, tells the American version of this lurid celluloid safari. The David Attenborough tradition of real naturalists and real film footage was born out of all this - and mostly ignored. Konrad Lorenz did something called The Ethology of the Greylag Goose. Alexander Korda and Niko Tinbergen, the scientist who inspired generations of zoologists, worked with John Grierson on The Private Life of the Gannet, which raked in a net profit of Â£220 after an 18-month run. One of Tinbergen's book spin-offs from his filmic career pursuing seabirds was marketed in the popular press as Sex and the Single Gull. The public wanted drama, tenderness, comedy, sex and violence - or at least a perm of any three from those five. Disney moved from Bambi and Thumper to apparently authentic crowd-pleasers of the True Life Adventure series such as Beaver Valley, Nature's Half Acre and The Living Desert. Hollywood, meanwhile, auditioned for Lassie and Rin Tin Tin. Even when the nature documentary grew up and got classy, the sales pitch carried on coarsely. Time-Life Video advertised Attenborough's The Trials of Life with a clip of killer whales snatching sea lion pups off the beach and the voice-over \"See up close how the law of the jungle is kill or be killed... find out why they call them animals!\" Mitman, born in 1960, grew up on films starring Flipper the dolphin and the underwater adventures of Jacques Cousteau. They set him off on a course of marine biology and then into the history of science, from which vantage point he began to see how movies had shaped his own attitudes towards nature. Meanwhile, out there in the real world, a huge tragedy is taking place. Most of the megafauna movie stars are being extinguished, or are surviving only in national parks and reserves. That is why he prefaces his book about nature on film with a visit to Disney's Animal Kingdom. \"There is something very troubling about what that says about our kind of relationship to nature,\" he writes. \"It may be the only way it can exist - that is the more chilling side. I remember hearing a story a couple of years ago. I was talking to primatologists about an effort to create a CD-rom library of primate behaviour, and the justification was so they could study these animals even when they had become extinct. To me that is a chilling statement about where we might be headed. The future is maybe us making nature films in Disney's Animal Kingdom.\" â¢ Reel Nature: America's Romance with Wildlife on Film, by Gregg Mitman (Harvard, Â£18.50)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/apr/15/weekend7.weekend3","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-15T01:00:00Z","webTitle":"Where to source the best British cheeses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/apr/15/weekend7.weekend3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/apr/15/weekend7.weekend3","fields":{"headline":"Where to source the best British cheeses","bodyText":"So, I'm standing in Neal's Yard Dairy in Covent Garden while around me several cheeses lounge about, humming gently to themselves, and I'm looking for that rarity, the traditional Caerphilly. What's more, I'm looking for one that topped the league of Welsh cheeses at last year's British Cheese Awards. Fortunately, Geoffrey can help. He points me in the direction of the two Caerphillys stocked by Neal's Yard Dairy (020-7379 7646), one by Chris Duckett, Somerset cheesemaker and bestower of the Caerphilly baton to one Martin (known as Todd) Trethowan, whose cheese I've come in search of today. Maugan Trethowan, brother and business partner of Todd, describes their cheese as having \"a fresh, lemony taste, slightly salty and well-rounded; it lasts in your mouth\", which is better than I could have phrased it. Todd and two enthusiastic employees turn out 114 8lb cheeses every week, all made by hand, from their farm tucked under the Cambrian mountains in Ceredigion. So far, so authentic. They use traditional methods to a traditional recipe to produce a traditional Caerphilly of the type lugged underground by Welsh miners in generous, cake-like wedges. It's a surprise, then, to discover that the gold medal-winning Gorwydd Caerphilly business is all of four years old, and that the brothers (whisper it) aren't actually Welsh. Maugan joined the fledgling family firm only two years ago, turning his back on a career in archaeology to get his hands stuck into the curds and whey business. \"I'd been involved in helping out before,\" he says, \"so it was the logical step to join full-time. I was enjoying archaeology, but the prospect of my own business, making an award-winning cheese, was a challenge.\" Besides, he says, the two aren't so different: \"I always enjoyed the physical side of archaeology, the digging, the hands-on work, being out and about. Cheesemaking is very similar. There's the same sense of satisfaction.\" Founding partner Todd had solid reasons for choosing the Welsh countryside to try his hand at making a Caerphilly, though. The Trethowans have their links with the country, admittedly via Cornwall, but, more important, after 10 years of working with cheesemakers the length of Britain, Todd had realised that Welsh-made Caerphilly was something of an endangered species. A former Neal's Yard Dairy employee himself, he'd been sent out to learn life at the stickier end of the business, and found himself happier amid the rennet. Armed with the Caerphilly recipe divulged to him by Duckett (with \"certain modifications\"), Todd decided to go west. Ask why a Welsh Caerphilly should be better than a Wherever Caerphilly, and the reasons come thick and fast. A territorial cheese such as Caerphilly thrives in certain environmental conditions - rainfall (presumably lots of), mould and soil types, humidity - which Todd found in abundance at Gorwydd Farm, wedged between the shadow of the Cambrians and the banks of the Teifi. Pitching up here meant a ready supply of real Welsh milk from real Welsh cows belonging to real Welsh farmers - who, unsurprisingly, are thrilled at the revival of the dairy tradition on their doorstep. \"Our local ties are important to us,\" Maugan says. \"The farmers are pleased that we've decided to do this here.\" Help was also forthcoming from various Welsh business agencies, keen to see Caerphilly re-established in its homeland. In an EC Objective One area (categorised as being in need of financial assistance to reach European levels of investment and employment), the Trethowans are doing their bit to keep the area's dairy heritage healthy. And, despite plans to boost production of their Caerphilly, they have no intention of moving out of Ceredigion. \"We're definitely staying,\" says Maugan. \"We've got a good system, with enthusiastic people who care about the cheese. We've no plans to go global.\" So, despite ferrying their cheeses to all corners of the kingdom, and even over the waters to America, the team at Gorwydd Farm will continue to cut the curd and texture the cheese with minimal mechanical intervention, and to set up stall at London's Borough Market every weekend to sell big wedges of Welsh heritage to the vacuum-packed Cheddar generation. And my description of the Gorwydd Caerphilly to a member of the aforementioned generation? I could laud the creamy outside (known as the \"breakdown\"), which changes subtly in flavour as the cheese matures, or enthuse about the firmer, flakier centre, which has more of a kick. But, most of all, it tastes like cheese - hand-textured, hand-moulded, hands-on cheese."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2000/apr/15/fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-15T01:00:00Z","webTitle":"The wordly mystic's late bloom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/15/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/apr/15/fiction","fields":{"headline":"The wordly mystic's late bloom","bodyText":"Lately, among Saul Bellow's keenest readers there had been somewhat emaciated expectations. It seemed that energy was fading. Bellow's first novel appeared in 1944, he had been writing for nearly 50 years, and it was perhaps time for his admirers to polish their gratitude for the earlier work and let things go. In 1995, Bellow was poisoned by eating toxic fish in the Caribbean, developed pneumonia, and very nearly died in a Boston hospital. When he at last recovered, he was not strong enough to sign a cheque, had no idea of the day or month. His nervous system had almost been erased by the poisons, and he needed months of primitive tuition to reclaim it. When he published a novella, The Actual, in 1996, it was a feat to have written it at all. Unsurprisingly, it seemed a mere ricochet from a talent that had already hit many targets; it had an interrupted energy. How extraordinary, then, that Bellow's substantial new novel, Ravelstein, written in his 85th year, should be so full of the old, cascading power, its prose displaying that august raciness one remembers from Herzog (1964) and Humboldt's Gift (1975), darting with metaphor and wit. The book's protagonist, Abe Ravelstein, is a lightly disguised portrait of Bellow's old friend, Allan Bloom, the conservative Chicago political theorist who became famous for his book The Closing Of The American Mind (1987). Indeed, it memorialises a larger intellectual community at the University of Chicago, and tells the story of Bloom's death from Aids, and of Bellow's dance with death five years ago. Most of the recent events in Bellow's life find their telling in this new book. But before one knows that,the novel's prose has to be reckoned with; it has an abundance and energy remarkable for a man his age, an overflowing quality that dissolves the book's biographical powders, and insists on its own autonomy. It tends to make irrelevant the usual questions of \"Who is X based on?\" Here are some of the many lustres to be found in Ravelstein. There is an angry cardiologist, who grips his stethoscope \"like a slingshot\". Or a man, seen with \"accordion pleats under his chin\". Or the neurologist who coaxes the poisoned Bellow-figure - the book's narrator - back from death, and is described thus: \"Dr Bax, like a skilful Indian scout of the last century, pressed his ear to the rail and heard the locomotive coming. Life would soon be back, and I would occupy my seat in the life-train. Death would shrink to its former place at the margin of the landscape.\" In these instances, one hears the sound of the Bellow of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. He once said that, in old age, he had so little energy that \"you have your foot to the floor but you are only going 20 miles an hour\". Of course, his own habitual recourse to metaphor, even in this instance, suggested otherwise, and his new book entirely contradicts his own fatalism. Recently, he joked, unconvincingly, that \"maybe one reason that I have so much energy is that I'm so lazy, really. I preserve my energies.\" At present, they are doubtless stretched, because in addition to the media-flummery of bringing out a new book, Bellow has recently become a father. His wife, Janis, gave birth to a daughter, Naomi Rose, at the end of last year. He has been much more involved in the child's early months than perhaps he expected to be. He plays the recorder to her (he is an accomplished musician), and sings the Volga Boat Song, and various Yiddish tunes. \"I'm the kid's personal troubador,\" he laughs. Janis Freedman, then a graduate student of Allan Bloom's, met Bellow 15 years ago, at the University of Chicago. Bellow was estranged from his fourth wife, Alexandra Ionesco Tulesca, a Romanian astro-phycisist. After marriages to Anita Goshikin, Alexandra Tschacbashov, Susan Glassman and Tulesca, and three sons, he has described himself as a serial husband, yet it is clear that in this fifth marriage an equilibrium and blessing has been found that he did not perhaps expect. He is aware of the rigidities in the writer's domestic life: and while no Tolstoy of matrimonial demand, has never hidden his past failings and impossibilities. In his new book, he pays a fine tribute to Janis, to her intelligence and beauty, and writes that the narrator and his wife understand each other. That is certainly the particular vibration the Bellows's marriage sounds. They have been living in Boston since 1994 - Janis teaches political theory at Boston University, and Bellow gives a statesman's course in the European novel - and their lives have a shapely, seasonal balance. In term time they write and teach, and entertain in their large, unlavish home in a Boston suburb; and in the long summer they decamp to Vermont, where they have a house built to Bellow's specifications (he can lie in the bath and study the stars through a skylight.) Until the Caribbean collapse, he rode a bike and swam in the local lake. They read Shakespeare out loud, sometimes auditioning village guests for other parts. Janis, in her early 40s, has a warm, shrewd, limitless quality, and a kind of wiry patience that suggests great reserves of strength.During his ordeal at the hospital in Boston she did not leave his room for 10 days, fearful that if she was absent even for a minute, he might die alone. Staff brought her infrequent meals. Bellow knows she saved his life, and continues to save it in some measure. It was touching, last year, to see the couple when Janis was very pregnant, the great gourd of her belly making mobility difficult, and her much older husband, differently frail, tender and solicitous on her behalf. They are unwarily loving in public: it is one of those marriages that seems entirely right, the provider of its own nutrients. Bellow seems unsurprised by, though grateful for, this late burst of creativity. But his biographer, James Atlas, rightly says that Ravelstein \"is an astonishing book, one of his strongest, and it comes, as you know, after a period of attenuation. Who are the other great writers who have done anything like this in their 80s? Tolstoy's late stories, I guess. Otherwise, I can only think of Thomas Mann, who created the character of Felix Krull, when he was, I think, 79.\" And Bellow's old friend, Keith Botsford, who with him edits an irregular literary journal called The Republic of Letters, admits that he is \"amazed. The power is there; it takes a little longer.\" Bellow himself seems chiefly concerned that readers will ignore the book's fictive qualities, and consider it only as a memoir of Allan Bloom. \"There is a strange literalism that's become a habit in America, \" he says. \"People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When people proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. Allan was certainly one. Yet I can't help being a fiction-writer. It's a curious process. Life is obviously feeding you, yet Ravelstein is a composite, taken from 100 different streams, like all of my characters.\" This seems true, for one finds oneself treating Ravelstein as if he simply joins the room of large Bellovian comic characters, like Moses Herzog, or Tommy Wilhelm in Seize The Day, or Uncle Benn Crader in More Die Of Heartbreak, or Victor Wulpy, in \"What Kind Of A Day Did You Have?\" (another powerful intellectual, yet one who \"wore his pants negligently,\" in Bellow's unforgettable phrase). Bellow is celebrated for his powers of physical portraiture, of grotesquerie, which tend to make all of his characters old, whatever their actual age: they are seniors in moral struggle. One of the comedies of this description is that while Bellow insists on our free agency as intelligences and souls, he gestures at the same time toward the physical imprisonment of our bodies. We are all victims, physically, all helpless account-keepers. That is why his heroes are so often bearish, large, fat-chested, panting, clumsy men - yet with delicate sensitivities. These men wear their moral age visibly, as a tree stump is ringed with years, and this in turn tells us something about Bellow's metaphysics. For he is not a psychologist, as novelists go. He does not go around unpicking his characters' selves, and truffling for motives. Instead, his people are embodied souls; they wear their stretched essences on their bodies, and it is Bellow's delight to, as it were, \"read\" their souls through their surfaces, as a Victorian phrenologist might read the skull. As in Dickens, Bellow's characters are flat, but they vibrate very strongly. The difference with Dickens, of course, is that Bellow writes often about intellectuals. Thus his people, paradoxically, are all mind and, simultaneously, all body. Typically, Ravelstein, in Bellovian mode, is large, flamboyant, and excessively clumsy. When he laughs, he throws his head back \"like Picasso's wounded horse in Guernica\". He loves fine clothes, Lanvin jackets, Zegna ties, but tends to spill food on them. Hostesses know to put newspaper underneath Ravelstein's chair at a dinner party. At home, he wanders around in an exquisite silk dressing-gown, chain-smoking. His apartment is stuffed with beautiful glass and silverware, with the finest Italian and French linens, and thousands of CDs. He reclines on a black leather couch, listening to Baroque music, is enormously learned, and given to oration on a thousand subjects. Though Bellow does not say it, Ravelstein has more than a touch of Proust's Charlus, the brilliant, snobbish homosexual who loudly lectures Marcel as they walk along the Parisian boulevards. (Bellow is a careful reader of Proust.) Or closer to home, Ravelstein is a more refined version, perhaps, of Simkin, the lawyer in Herzog, who \"liked to lie down on the black Naugahyde sofa in his office, cover himself with an afghan knitted by his mother, listening to Palestrina, Monteverdi, as he elaborated his legal and business strategies.\" Ravelstein has become rich and famous with a popular book which has distilled to ordinary readers his conservative analysis of American decline. Now in the summer of his fame and influence, he likes to keep in touch with his former students, several of whom are in the US government. He is a shambolic gossip; the novel's narrator mentions a colleague who liked to joke that \"when I gossip it isn't gossip but social history\". He is loyally attended to by his boyfriend, Nikki. By all accounts, including Bellow's, this is Allan Bloom as his friends knew him. Keith Botsford says that Bellow and Bloom, in addition to sharing a love of music, \"practised a kind of emotional shorthand together. Most of Saul's friendships have been like this. You have to be learned, to have read nearly everything, as he has done, and above all to enjoy it.\" Bloom, Botsford continues, \"was an irresistible figure, especially to a novelist, whatever one's opinion about his politics. I remember sitting in Allan's apartment, and as usual he was wearing his beautiful silk bathrobe, somewhat opened so that you could, um, admire what was inside, and he went to get some CD or other to play. He had a fantastic collection of CDs. As he stood at the wall, he passed a map of Jerusalem that was hanging on it. 'And that's a self-portrait,' he said, gesturing towards the map. That was the kind of life-force he was.\" Bellow and Bloom taught together at the University of Chicago in the 70s and 80s. The university, which has always been a bulwark of a Great Books approach to learning, was perhaps at the height of its influence. Its committee on social thought allowed novelists (like Bellow), classicists, economists, and philosophers to draft their own courses. Milton Friedman (Thatcher's economics guru), Edward Shills, the great scholar of comparative religion Mircea Eliade were all at Chicago at the same time. \"Chicago was a place that loved irregular people,\" says Bellow. \"Great scholars, most of them, but people with interesting streaks and histories.\" He has always been drawn to powerful intellects, in part because they offer an adequate match to his own powers, and also in part because their existence sanctions his own will-to-theory, his fondness for making use of speculation and scholarship in his fiction. Yet intellectuals are also a source of comedy because as scholars they are often labouring on quests for what is essential, but as private citizens their lives are full of the usual nonsense and superfluity. So their intellectual work seems to bring them no benefit, no relief, in domestic life. This is humblingly true of Moses Herzog, Bellow's most famous creation, a scholar of the Romantics who is undergoing a vicious divorce, and has taken to write zany letters of plaint in his head to famous people, dead and alive: to Churchill, Heidegger, Spinoza, Eisenhower. But more generally, Bellow's work has as its theme the struggle to find what is essential amidst the piles of our emotional slack, and amidst the heap of trivia and gratuity that is the contemporary world. Allan Bloom seems to fit this mould, a penetrating intellect who soiled his ties. But Bellow was obviously attracted by more. There was a political agreement between the two men, a feeling that America was refusing to talk honestly about its problems, and instead hiding them under wish-fulfilment or meaningless jargon. For both Bloom and Bellow, America, in its materialism, its violence, its shallowness, embodied \"nihilism without the abyss\". In his novel The Dean's December, written in 1982, his first after winning the Nobel Prize in 1976, Bellow contrasted prosperous, capitalist America with punitive, communist Romania. In the Communist world, there was \"hard nihilism\"; in America, there was \"soft nihilism\". Both dispensations incarnated a kind of cynicism about the possibilities of spiritual life. Bellow's complaint against America had been building since the 1960s, and The Dean's December, with its superb but unsettling descriptions of the Chicago ghettoes, was taken, by many, as a rancidly conservative book, even a racist one. Bellow describes The Dean's December as a \"cri de coeur. I disliked the fact that people wouldn't talk about this stuff honestly, particularly the state of the ghettoes, the inner-cities. But I don't know if anyone heard it.\" Five years later, he embossed his reputation as a neo-conservative by writing the introduction to Bloom's book, The Closing Of The American Mind, which wailed against the decline of the great universities, the destruction, as Bloom saw it, of the traditional literary canon, the sanctimonies of the left, the triumph of political correctness, and so on. Some found his endorsement of what seemed a rather mediocre conservative squeal a diminishment. There are probably some who feel that Bellow's new valedictory to Bloom is a further political fall. One of Bellow's friends, Robert Boyers, the editor of the literary and cultural journal Salmagundi, explains: \"Bellow rapidly became anathema to left-leaning liberal academics. That preface marked his separation from mainstream American academic life. But it has probably not affected his reputation as a writer: it's mostly in the realm of PR or politics.\" What, I ask Boyers, did Bellow find so attractive in Bloom? \"He liked the courage of going against the grain of so many ideas dearly held by the academic world. Bloom had written the book that Bellow might have written had he the appetite to do it.\" Yet Bellow's preface is not espe cially political. Instead, it is largely an insistence, congruent with all his work, that the self should not be defined politically, nor even intellectually. Bloom, who was able to escape his clumsy body and his undistinguished origins by the power of mind, was probably attractive to Bellow because he was an example of the way the self flies beyond the nets that society wants to throw over it. This liberation had an urgency at a time when, more strongly perhaps than now, academics and theorists were herding people into their ethnicities, sleeving them in racial and political data, arguing that we are always the ideology that speaks us, not the voice that sings over ideology. Singularity - if one wanted a word to define Bellow's ambitions for the self it would be this. In many ways, he is an Emersonian individualist. Moses Herzog recalls being a class orator at school, and reciting from Emerson: \"The private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy than any kingdom in history.\" This Emersonianism is then crossed with Russian and Jewish influences. It is hard not to hear Bellow in Martin Buber, when Buber writes that \"the uniqueness of man proves himself in his life with others. For the more unique a man really is, so much the more can he give to the other.\" Bellow's characters, especially his intellectuals, are people, like him, who grew up in straitened circumstances and discovered the expansions of thought in books, and then felt free to roam wherever they liked. He is something of a zealot for the freedoms of the soul. One of the more provocative contradictions of Bellow's enterprise is that he has been a late-modern novelist, writing in the age of Beckett and Bernhard (Beckett read Bellow with pleasure, and the two met once in Paris), who has yet prolonged the soul-pungency of the great 19th-century Russian novelists. He is most like Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky in his determination to deliver his characters from the inessential. Of course, Bellow was nearly born in St. Petersburg, as Saul Belov. His family emigrated from Russia to Quebec, where he was born in 1915. But they moved to America, and he grew up in Chicago, \"clumsy, tender, stinking Chicago, dumped on its ancient lake bottom\". Chicago, as he has often said, was a fine place for a boy like him to educate himself. He took nourishment from the great books in the public libraries. In addition, traders came by with cheap editions of new work. \"You could get freethinkers like TH Huxley, along with Tolstoy's Confession, and selections from Hegel. It was a comprehensive education,\" says Bellow. And there was a thriving sensory world, of course. There were Jews and Poles, Germans, Italians and Russians, and Bellow was a keen observer. Much of this early life finds its way into the big novels like The Adventures Of Augie March, Herzog, and Humboldt's Gift. Moses Herzog recalls receiving packets of worthless roubles from Grandfather Herzog, still in Russia. \"You held the glorious bills to the light and you saw Peter the Great and Catherine in the watermarked rainbow paper.\" This was almost certainly a family memory or story. Bellow has been associated with Bloom, and with neo-conservatism, for over a decade now. He jokes that \"Allan had very serious enemies, and I came in for my share - a kind of agent's percentage cut.\" But Bellow's sense of the world is finally religious, rather than political, and in this regard his new novel joins arms with his earliest work. Occasionally, one senses a tension between the Bellovian narrator and his metaphysical, even mystical impulses, and Ravelstein's atheist-materialism. Bellow's new book is ghosted by death. His locomotive has raced past the death-sidings, full of friends like John Berryman, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison. One sometimes forgets that Bellow belongs to Robert Lowell's generation - Lowell, who died in 1977. He has been not only the greater writer than any of them, but the more steadily persistent. Allan Bloom's death perhaps seemed like a warning: Bellow next. He writes, in Ravelstein, of Chicago (though the city is unnamed): \"On every one of the surrounding streets there were front rooms where friends had lived - and at the sides, the windows of bedrooms where they died... It was collection time for an entire generation.\" Partly to soften hard memories, the Bellows moved to Boston in 1994. I first met him, one of the few living writers I admired as I admired the august dead, 10 years ago, in Chicago. In his mid-70s then, he was vigorous, commanding, and planted solidly on his home turf: he offered to drive me around, and introduce me to his \"contacts\" - the dry-cleaners, hotel-managers, policemen and local politicians who fund his fictional version of Chicago. I met him again in 1996, not long after the Caribbean collapse, in Boston, and he was not strong enough to lift the salad-bowl. A gate had closed, one thought. Surely Bellow's style, so obviously indexed to his energy, a kind of intellectual virility, really, had died, too, was now as weak as the hand that had been so easily vanquished by the little salad-bowl, with its burden of greens. He had an old man's impatience at this dinner party, stiffly drumming his vine-like fingers, and eager for his bed. In the past few years I have been lucky enough to witness Bellow's renovation, sometimes in Washington, more often in Boston. At times he seems weary or withdrawn, but more often one is struck by how intellectually speedy is his mind, still throwing out Bellovian enticements. What is Bellovian? At a restaurant last year, a pompous dessert was served. The chef had placed little dots of red coulis around the rims of the bowls, each dot geometrically exact. It seemed that someone had measured the gap between each blob. \"Euclidean pimples!\" Bellow said, raised his head, and offered his jointed, sluggish laugh. When one thinks of a phrase from Bellow, it almost always has this kind of wit, and of course it is a metaphysical wit in the way that Donne or Shakespeare is: a metaphorical liveliness, yoking together apparent incompatibles. There is Valentine Gersbach, in Herzog, with his wooden leg, \"gracefully bending and straightening like a gondolier,\" or Mason, the young thug in The Dean's December, whom \"you had to study to find the humanity in. It was like looking for the mercury in a thermometer.\" It is not surprising that Joyce is one of Bellow's great pleasures, nor that he owns one of the Shakespeare and Company's editions of Ulysses, with the Parisian typesetter's errors. \"It was smuggled into America by a schoolfriend of mine.\" In Joycean style, Bellow loves puns and wordgames. One of his jokes, which gets into Ravelstein, is to turn the Jermyn Street shirtmaker, Turnbull and Asser, into \"Kisser and Asser\". And this is not mere play, because it also contains a worldly judgment about Jews dressing as goys, kissing the gentile ass, as it were. Bellow is a worldly mystic. His prose logs impressions with broken speed; his metaphysical engine then grinds through these images for what is essential. In Herzog, Moses is seen pausing on \"the metal doors of the sidewalk elevator,\" and receiving \"the raised pattern of the steel door through his thin shoes; like Braille. But he did not interpret a message.\" It could be said that the world presses on Bellow's characters like Braille for those who do not need it. Reality is both a code and a distraction, and the task is to sort out the necessary from the superfluous. For all that Bellow may be seen by some as a conservative, he has been constantly hospitable to American modernity, especially to the tumult of the city. He says that \"America contains all human types\", and it is true of his books. It is this wordliness that allows him to be, as a stylist, both an aesthete and a pounding realist, so that he is very exquisite without being precious. He truly writes prose, but prose written at least as well as verse, and it is doubtless this combination of the worldly and the lyrical that has been such an influence not only on Philip Roth and Don DeLillo, but on the most interesting stylists in Britain, like McEwan, Amis, Rushdie. And at 85, astoundingly, he is still writing. One thinks of Henry James on his deathbed, the writing hand still moving involuntarily. Bellow will write to the end, no doubt, harnessed to the novel, that form he has sharpened again and again since the early 1940s. His biographer, James Atlas, says: \"He used to say when he was in his 70s, 'I'm not ready to be summed up yet', and I thought, privately, 'Yeah, yeah.' But you know what? It turns out he's right.\" Life at a glance: Saul Bellow Born: June 10 1915, Lachine, Quebec, Canada. Education: University of Chicago 1933-95, Northwestern University 1937, BS.

Most of his boats have been built or refitted in Bristol and he's often sailed with the tide out of the Cumberland Basin and under the famous Clifton suspension bridge at the start of one of the eventful voyages - sometimes over-eventful - during his 30 years as a sailor. There have been more times when, in between voyages, he's walked across Clifton Downs to the gorge to survey the same scene from the perspective of terra firma. This was his first UK walk following his rescue by the Australian navy after spending five days and nights on the upturned Exide Challenger in the Southern Ocean during the Vendee Globe round-the-word race three years ago. \"I walk to the bottom of our road, then down Claypits Lane and straight across the Downs for a couple of miles to the Sea Walls, just above the gorge,\" he says. \"It's never crowded and, in the winter, it can be quite desolate. \"Once you get to the Sea Walls, there's a wire fence, but you can look down into the gorge and at the suspension bridge just sitting there, all stark and misty in the winter and in the summer all warm and crystal clear. It's really quite special. \"Walking is a little of everything for me: it's exercise and it gets you out into what I call the freedom zone, where you can think quite deeply about the things you're involved in - your life, your activities, your family. Or you can just let it all fade away and stare into oblivion. I go on my own, mainly, because I find it's a loner's job.\" When he's skirted the gorge, he goes past Bristol zoo and takes a detour through the Downs, if there's time. The Downs have been used at various periods by thieves, prostitutes and rival Civil War armies, but the Victorians prettified it and now there's nothing more dangerous than a mobile cafÃ©. Sailing rather than walking remains his obsession, but he's scaled things down a bit. Training for his next voyage will be a run of three miles round the Downs each morning rather than six, and the voyages will be with a crew rather than the single-handed ventures that have seen him lose three boats. One forthcoming voyage is called the Great Race of the Century and should finally give him the circumnavigation of the globe, which he calls his \"unfinished business\". The kingdom of Brunel The Bristol Tourist Office's guide to suburban walks describes a two-hour route through Clifton covering some of Tony Bullimore's ground. By the suspension bridge is a visitor centre that describes how the engineer Thomas Telford was asked in 1829 to judge a design competition. He rejected all the entries, submitted one of his own and declared it the winner. This was blocked by Bristolians, who substituted one with an Egyptian theme by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Riots and shortages of money delayed completion until 1864, after the great engineer had died. The bridge carries three million vehicles a year and has been notorious for suicides. Brunel's other links with Bristol are Temple Meads, the terminus of his Great Western Railway from London, and his three great ships built in the docks - the Great Western, the Great Eastern and the SS Great Britain. SS Great Britain was launched in 1843 and towed home in 1970 from the Falklands, where it was wrecked and spent 80 years as a coal bunker. It gets 100,000 visitors a year and a Â£7 million lottery application has been lodged to put the hull under a huge glass shield to halt its rusting. \"Everything in the Great Britain had been tried somewhere else, but their conjunction in one ship was quite remarkable,\" says Shane Casey, assistant curator. \"It was 100ft longer than any previous ship, which was just mind-boggling, and during its life it retained that mystical quality, rather like Concorde. \" Other walking routes in the Tourist Office's booklets take you round sites of historical and maritime interest in the city. They include a Literary Trail, which passes the birthplace of Thomas Chatterton, and places connected with the Romantics Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Some long-distance paths also cross or touch the city: the Frome Valley Walkway from south Gloucestershire, for example, and the Monarch Way, which follows the southwards flight of Charles II from the Parliamentarians. The Severn Way, which starts at that river's source and ends on the Bristol Channel, can be extended by walking up the Avon to Bristol and Bath, from where the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal can be followed to the River Thames and then London. â¢ The SS Great Britain costs Â£6.20 and includes interpretative displays in the Maritime Heritage Centre and a visit to the replica of the Matthew, the ship of 15th-century explorer John Cabot.

That was my guide, George, and I hoped he was referring to the horn on the rhino's nose. I had never considered rhinos to be particularly well camouflaged, but as George became more and more agitated in the driver's seat, I strained my eyes to see the creature amongst the wavy yellow stems. 'You see 'im. Dere is a mother, a father and a baby. Man, they so ugly.' George was a taxi driver who had picked me up in Nairobi, and he had somehow managed to talk me into letting him act as my safari guide for the afternoon. He had insisted that he would show me 'all de animals,' and so far he wasn't doing a bad job. I still couldn't see the rhino, though, and I began to wonder if he was hallucinating. After all, his animal identification skills were limited, everything vaguely antelope-like was termed 'gazelle', and anything resembling a monkey was labelled 'baboon'. For all I knew he could have been looking at a family of tortoises or something, and assuming that they were rhinos. As I watched intently, I suddenly saw movement. George was clamping his fists to his nose and excitedly making trumpeting noises, as the male ambled out into the open. 'You' see 'im now? He use de horn to kill food.' This was another of George's unique insights into the animal kingdom of southern Africa. He was making it up as he went along, but it all served to make things interesting. Following the huge bull came the slightly smaller female, and then the sprightly youngster, skipping along and chasing a terrified butterfly. Why it didn't just fly a bit higher, I'll never know. 'Get a photo. Show your friends,' George insisted, taking the words out of my mouth. Tentatively, I leant out of the window of our ageing Peugeot taxi. Rust fell to the floor in orange flakes as I positioned my arms on the door and raised the camera to my eyes. Through the lens I saw the expression on the face of the bull change from contentment, to curiosity, to furious anger. 'Uh-ho, 'im not 'appy,' George said, with impressive understatement. Before I knew it, the rhino's head was bowed and he was charging. George tried frantically to restart the engine and I placed my head between my legs, bracing myself for impact in the way they show us all on an aircraft safety drill card. I was convinced that the papier-mchÃ© taxi would be crushed by the rampaging four-ton beast. Just in time, the engine started with a splutter. George accelerated away from the crazed animal, leaving me with minor whiplash injuries and a rather closer view of a fibrous rhino horn than I would have liked. Still in shock, I watched the angry rhino contemplating our escape via the taxi's rear-view mirror. 'You wanna go back and get your photo?' George inquired, concerned that I had missed out. 'I'll buy a postcard,' I managed to stammer.

This was a little ironic given the immense amount of effort which the present Government has put into presentation. The very fact that a senior Minister should say such a thing does not, at first look, fit easily with polling returns that show record popularity for a government at this stage in the political cycle. To understand the Minister's concerns, it is necessary to recognise that politicians do not address one audience, but a whole series of them, most of which have differing expectations of the government of the day. Not for nothing is politics defined as the art of the possible. What the Minister was perhaps unconsciously saying was that there is a problem for the Government in addressing its core vote and its own party activists. Recent reports suggest that Millbank is anticipating major losses in the forthcoming local elections, although there have been immediate rebuttals of the leaked information. Nevertheless, given the high point in local election success in 1996, it would be astonishing if Labour did not lose seats this time around, regardless of the Government's poll standing. Yet there are other signs that all is not well within the Labour family. Apparently, about a third of Labour constituency parties have not bothered to nominate a delegate to the annual jamboree known as the Labour Party conference. Traditionally, this has been a high point in the calendar for Labour Party activists, often with fierce competition for delegate places. Indifference to it is sure sign of trouble at t'mill. The anecdotal evidence within the Parliamentary Labour Party is of a disjunction between activists and the Government. The reasons for this remain clouded in mystery for many MPs, who are rightly focused on government successes. Is the aforementioned Minister right? Is it merely a presentational problem with one of a number of target audiences? We have to first look at that audience, a wide spectrum of people, both geographically and socially. Their common link is the Labour Party and its values, particularly its commitment to social justice. The link between them was reinforced by 18 long years in opposition, fighting the repugnant tenets of Thatcherism. Their high hopes in May 1997 were based upon a profound sense of optimism, hence, the resonance of 'Things Can Only Get Better' as a campaign song. While a minority still hankered for 'The Internationale' or 'Jerusalem', the modernity of the campaign tune reflected the acceptance of the need for modernisation - of the Labour Party, the constitution, the Government, the country. The huge enthusiasm of that spring paralleled that of Prague in 1968. Why, then, is there now, three short years later, a sense of unease among many Labour supporters? Part of the answer lies with people's own experience on the ground. They tend to judge a government's performance not by inputs, no matter how impressive, but by outcomes. Their experience is reflected in the findings of the Office of National Statistics, which reports an increasing gap between rich and poor. In many parts of the country, they recognise the conclusion last week of the economic consultancy, Business Strategies, that the North-South divide is getting worse. An issue for Labour Party activists is a feeling of irrelevance in the overall scheme of things. It is this sense of alienation which has led to the less than enthusiastic take-up of conference seats. It emanates in part from a perception of an increasingly centralised party structure, a suspicion of an emasculated conference and a belief that we are heading towards a happy-clappy, American-style form of politics. This is anathema to activists although it may be attractive to some newer members who see 1997 as Year Zero. It is a perplexing situation. It may be that current party strategists are right, believing this to be a period of metamorphosis into an as yet ideologically undefined new political entity. For a governing party, however, it is a particularly dangerous conundrum. For those same strategists have a very simple strategy. They have adopted clothes and language consonant with those whose votes gave us the Thatcher-Major years. They have asserted repeatedly that our core supporters would stay with the Labour Government simply because they had no other political home to go to. They argue in party councils that the result in 1997 confirmed their thesis. They had based their original views on Clinton's break from traditional party parameters in the presidential campaign of 1992. However, time has moved on in America and the United Kingdom. There is also another polity closer to ours whose experience merits examination. In the early Nineties, the Australian Labour Party started to suffer from the attrition of their core supporters. Where did they go? They stayed at home. A conversation last week with Australian politician Wayne Swan indicated that 'things have moved on'. Many stay-at-homes now do turn out to vote - for the xenophobic extremism of Pauline Hanson. For both party and governmental reasons, it is essential that such a tendency should not develop here. A government at odds with its party activists is in danger of denying itself the many thousands of personal networks which those activists represent and use at election periods. A sensible approach is to ensure - in word and deed - that both activists and core voters feel wanted by the Government. The worst of all worlds is for these lay audiences to believe that they are being taken for granted. It is not as if the Government is imperilled at the next election. It is the longer term effect on morale in the party and support on the street. Right now, Members of Parliament with relatively low majorities raise their eyes fearfully to the looming general election. They were given a salutary reminder of the swings and roundabouts of representative politics by the Prime Minister's recent comment on his anticipation of lost seats at the next general election. More than any others, such MPs in marginal seats will examine their local election results like an ancient diviner rummaging through the entrails of a chicken. The real challenge for the Government is already being recognised as the general election after next. There will be no credibility in blaming previous Tory governments for difficulties. There will have been a referendum on the euro. There will, barring miracles, be a decreased majority with more Labour members fearing a twist of the electoral cycle against them. And, of course, in Harold Macmillan's words, there will be 'events, dear boy, events'. It will require a hugely co-ordinated and disciplined effort to take the Labour Government through its second term. It will require committed activists and a resolute core support in the country. These not only provide the spine of campaigning, and a platform for electoral success, but give resolution to MPs who might waver under pressure. I suspect it will take more than presentational changes to keep them reassured - and they need reassuring now. â¢ Peter Kilfoyle is Labour MP for Liverpool, Walton, and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence until his resignation from the Government in January this year to rally the party's traditional voters.

There is something well worth watching on Sky One. The Tenth Kingdom is like an enjoyable Gormenghast, an elaborate fantasy but much less pretentious and far more fun. What we have here are creatures of the imagination escaping into the real world and back again. When characters from fairy tales burst into Central Park, their arrival is not as noticeable as you might expect. Prince Charming has been changed into an attractive dog called, what else, Prince; three thuggish trolls are indistinguishable from your run-of-the-mill mugger and the big, bad wolf is, demonstrably, still a wolf. Particularly when he catches sight of Virginia, the heroine. \"Tasty or WHAT!\" It is difficult to convey in the modesty of print just how noisy a native New Yorker can be when he puts his mind to it. Memorably played by Scott Cohen, this well over-the-top wolf (\"BORN TO GORGE!\") is what you might call an Alan Rickman role. Or, put another way, damned hard luck on the hero. The Tenth Kingdom, appropriately 10 hours long, was made at Pinewood (with a flurry of forays to Austria and France, which caused quarantine problems for Prince.) The cast are roughly half and half British and American and some of them, in a quiet way, take your breath away. When a lanky green Geordie said gloomily, \"My name's Clayface, the Goblin\", I heard myself saying, \"Oh no it's not! It's Jimmy Nail!\" You can play this pantomime game virtually indefinitely. The Tenth Kingdom isn't so straight-faced that you feel you shouldn't. Simon Moore, who wrote it, shows all the signs of a child who once lived in the kingdom of his own head. There's plenty of pantomime, with particular reference to magic beans. Disney's Snow White is a strong influence, particularly the Wicked Queen, whose every appearance used to be greeted with a clatter of seats as a generation of children dived for the floor. And there are older, Grimmer legends like the Wicked Queen being forced to dance in hot metal shoes at Snow White's wedding. The prince is Snow White's grandson, morphed into a dog by the the current Wicked Queen. \"Happy ever after didn't last as long as we hoped,\" he said sadly. Labradors can do desolate, charming and dim. After that they're back to desolate. Prince does all these beautifully. Only a persistently wagging tail suggests that he hasn't quite grasped the seriousness of his situation. There are lines which struck me as unpushily funny. Prince is, naturally, rather officer-class. \"Follow me!\" he cried confidently. \"The dog said 'Follow him,'\" interpreted the heroine's father, who'd wasted a perfectly good wish learning dog-speak. Talking of dogs, Lucinda Lambton's lurcher has died. She appeared in One Foot In The Past (BBC2) wrapped all in black. \"Our beautiful dog, Flint, was killed here a few weeks ago. He died, thank heavens, a glorious death for a dog - in full and delirious flight, speared straight through the lungs and ribs by a long, sharp stick.\" Lucinda has been much missed and so, of course, is Flint. \"He was a rough-haired lurcher whom I love with all my might and main. He was just two years old. It's a sorry and strange business constantly catching sight of him or, rather, thinking that you are about to catch sight of him.\" In a power cut in a coal mine, you would know it was Lucinda. She is one of the last great alliterists and often gives adjectives a jolly good whack on the head to drive them home. If she goes overboard, it is a most distinctive dive. She determined (\"Huzzah and hurrah!\") to raise an obelisk to Flint's memory. The master mason, a man with a mordant sense of humour, arrived with a dog of his own. \"That's all we need, to run our dog over,\" he said, trundling the stone into place. Am I hallucinating or was that a topiary rabbit, all ears, beside Flint's grave? She took us round a pet cemetery, which included a large family of rats. \"Disraeli, a kind rat\" and \"Gladstone, a loving rat.\" You did wonder, albeit respectfully, why they were all called after politicians. I remember seeing a gravestone to Major. \"Born a dog. Died a gentleman.\" And another to Bill, a mule. \"He done his damnedest. No angel could do more.\" Guess their nationalities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/apr/17/1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-17T00:51:58Z","webTitle":"In brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/17/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/apr/17/1","fields":{"headline":"In brief","bodyText":"At least 44 die in Congo blasts The search continued in Congo yesterday for some of the dozens killed in explosions at Kinshasa's airport on Friday.

Tony Blair's rush to embrace Vladimir Putin, first with his visit to St Petersburg during last month's election campaign and now by hosting the Russian president-elect in London, is shameful, unseemly and surprisingly old-fashioned. It has disturbing echoes of the Soviet period when western statesmen often competed with each other to see who could develop the best special relationship with the Kremlin. That was the Old Diplomacy and it ought to have been discarded in an era when state planners no longer decide on contracts and European governments profess their aspirations to a common foreign policy. Mr Blair's infatuation with Mr Putin also has echoes of the Yeltsin years, when western governments invested too much in personalities rather than process. Instead of trying to encourage the growth of democratic institutions, the values of the parliamentary way, public accountability, and a system of checks and balances, they made the mistake of endorsing almost everything the increasingly vain and ailing autocrat in the Kremlin did, as long as he called it \"reform\". With President Yeltsin's departure the west had a chance for a fresh start, yet Mr Blair did not even observe the niceties of meeting any other presidential candidates when he travelled to St Petersburg. What kind of message of respect for pluralism did that send? The precipitate invitation for Mr Putin to visit the United Kingdom is doubly misguided at a moment when international criticism from respected human rights organisations and independent observers over Russia's tactics in its war in Chechnya is mounting. The prime minister argues that he did raise his concerns over Chechnya during his visit and did ask Mr Putin to provide access to international monitors. His overtures failed. And when the Council of Europe debated Russia's suspension two weeks ago it was UK diplomats who sought the softest resolution. It would have been much better for the UK to hold back until after Mr Putin is inaugurated next month. We do not want a freeze with Moscow, but nor do we want unseemly friendliness. Instead, we should stick to a cool and united European line which makes it clear to Moscow that the kind of brutalities being perpetrated by Russian forces in Chechnya are unacceptable on this continent. On Kosovo Mr Blair saw more clearly than some other leaders that the Serbian security forces' tactics of overkill and their wanton failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians were outrageous. It is strange he does not understand that Russian forces are acting similarly in Chechnya. No one doubts that Chechens have also committed atrocities, but neither under international law nor under the values of the Council of Europe does that justify atrocities in return. The council has asked its members to take Russia to the European Court for Human Rights over Chechnya. Mr Blair can redeem his earlier mistakes by announcing during Mr Putin's current visit to London that Britain will join that endeavour unless Moscow changes its tactics, sets up a serious inquiry into the complaint and allows international investigators into Chechnya forthwith. This is not a call for economic sanctions since they rarely work. Nor is it an attempt to humiliate Russia. Russia deserves to be strong and will be, whatever the west does. It is simply a public message to all Russia's leaders, in the Kremlin, the Duma, and the armed forces' general staff, that in Chechnya they have to clean up their act."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/18/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices3","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-18T17:20:38Z","webTitle":"William Hague's full speech (part two)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/18/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/18/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices3","fields":{"headline":"William Hague's full speech (part two)","bodyText":"We Conservatives have already committed ourselves to a policy of automatically detaining asylum seekers who come from countries which we know to be safe in reception centres until their cases are decided. Now we have decided that it would be right to go further. So the next Conservative Government will detain all new applicants for asylum, whether port applicants or in-country applicants, in reception centres until their cases have been determined. There will be a cost in providing the centres, but I am convinced, not least by the experience of our European neighbours, that this policy will have a significant deterrent effect on those thinking of travelling here without a well founded case. In fact, we estimate that overall, our new system would reduce the cost of at least Â£600 million that asylum currently imposes on the taxpayer. Second, we shall take action to speed up asylum decisions and appeals. A report commissioned by the Home Office from the consultants Vantagepoint identified massive and unnecessary delays in the system. Let me give just two examples. Under the present arrangements, an asylum seeker who arrives in Dover or at Heathrow is interviewed at length by an Immigration Officer. He then has to refer the case to the Immigration Directorate of the Home Office, in Croydon, for the papers to be reviewed and a decision made. If these two roles of interviewer and decision taker were merged, we should be able to remove delays of between five and twenty days in around fifteen to twenty thousand asylum cases each year. The Vantagepoint report has been on the Home Secretary's desk for the last nine months. We ought to implement its recommendations speedily on the handling of cases, and that asylum interviews should be tape-recorded. Incredible as it may seem, the usual practice is for the interviewer to record manually what is said by the applicant. It is sixteen years since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act required police interviews to be recorded on tape. The extension of that arrangement to our asylum and immigration system is long overdue. Third, we shall amend the law to deter applications by people who have come from a country which is manifestly safe. It is extraordinary that we receive applications for asylum from countries which have now been formally accepted as candidates for EU membership. How can we say, on the one hand, that we accept that a country has the rule of law and good government that would qualify it to join the EU and, on the other, that we believe its citizens to be suffering systematic persecution? A future Conservative Government will draw up a list of countries where we judge the rule of law is being properly enforced and from which we will not normally accept asylum applications. We shall write into the law a presumption that a claim is unfounded if the applicant has either travelled directly from or began his journey in a safe country. Fourth, we shall also make clear to our European partners that we expect them to take seriously their obligations under the Dublin Convention. In theory, under the Convention, asylum seekers should be dealt with by the first safe country they reach, regardless of where they choose to make their application. In practice however, this policy becomes unenforceable when migrants destroy their tickets so that it is difficult to prove exactly where they came from. Despite our geographical position, we saw in 1999 a surge in applications here which was not matched anywhere else in the European Union. Some of this, of course, is accounted for by refugees who have come directly to Britain from non-European ports of origin. But we are still left with thousands of people who have travelled illicitly through safe and prosperous parts of western Europe before choosing to declare that they are victims of political persecution. Something is going badly wrong when migrants are prepared to cross the length of the continent of Europe, without once being detained, in order to lodge their asylum claims in the United Kingdom. For every genuine refugee, the priority is surely to get out of a particular country, not to get in to one. There will be a few legitimate exceptions, for example someone may be joining other members of his family who have reached Britain by a different route. But barring such exceptional circumstances it is surely reasonable to expect anyone fleeing persecution to apply for sanctuary as soon as he reaches a safe country. I hope that that can be done in co-operation with our European neighbours. The next Conservative Government will press for intergovernmental agreement among the EU states not to turn a blind eye when their countries are being used as a stopover for asylum seekers transiting to a neighbouring country. We must call on our European neighbours to take the Dublin Convention seriously. We must also call on the British legal profession not to take international law to absurd lengths and interpret it in a way not recognised in other countries. It is very odd that our courts have on occasion decided that perfectly civilized countries in Western Europe such as, in one recent case, France, are not 'safe' places to which refused asylum seekers can be deported. If we cannot get the current international system to work properly we may have to begin to work with other countries to change that system. Fifth, when people have been refused asylum they should be removed from this country without delay. What is the point of spending all this time and money on assessing whether asylum seekers have a genuine case, when nothing is done with those who do not and when, in the meantime, those with bogus claims learn how to disappear into the melting pot of society? In the last six months for which there are figures, there were just over 10,000 asylum decisions. Only 12 per cent were granted asylum. Another 11 per cent were allowed exceptional leave to remain. 77 per cent - 8,000 asylum seekers - had their claims turned down. Yet during the same period, fewer than 4,000 actually left the country. The Home Office admit that they know of at least 20,000 asylum seekers who have absconded. Some reports suggest it could be much higher. The next Conservative Government will set up a Removals Agency with the sole mission of making sure that people who are supposed to leave the country, do so at once. That will take a burden off the police, and simplify the process of removals. The Removals Agency will be largely composed of Immigration Service staff, assigned permanently and full-time to removals duties, with their own chain of management and sense of purpose. We need to make clear to everyone that people whose claim for asylum is not justified will, quite simply, not stay in Britain. Sixth, we need to make sure that there is a dose of common sense in the way the existing law is applied. We need deterrence - but measured deterrence, which is likely actually to make a difference to the way people behave. There are penalties for businesses who illegally employ people who have no right to be in the UK. They are not being applied properly. We would make sure that they are applied, because the prospect of finding illegal work is one of the things that attracts abusive asylum applications. Take the Â£2,000 automatic fines on lorry drivers in Labour`s Immigration and Asylum Act. This automatic penalty does not distinguish between those who deliberately set out to evade the law, an offence already covered by criminal law with a penalty of up to 10 years in jail, and those who are the innocent victims of unscrupulous racketeers. We will seek to make the system fairer. Between eighty and ninety per cent of asylum applications are currently being refused because they have no foundation. Many of those asylum seekers should in any case never have made it to the UK in the first place, but should have been dealt with in the first safe country they came to. The package of measures I have outlined will deter bogus applications, while accelerating the progress of well-founded cases. People will know that if they claim asylum in Britain, then they will be detained and their cases will be dealt with quickly; genuine refugees will then be welcome to stay while bogus asylum seekers will be guaranteed a speedy departure from our shores. We will make it harder for criminals and shady businesses to exploit the asylum industry. We will protect the British taxpayer, and bring clarity to the current chaotic system. Clarity so all will know that Britain is just and fair, welcoming refugees, but not Europe\u0092s soft touch for those who want to play the system. In conclusion, I believe that offering asylum to genuine political refugees is the duty of democracies and the hallmark of a civilized nation. Since, as almost everyone accepts, no country can cope economically or socially with an unrestricted flow of migrants, the acceptance of political asylum seekers must be governed by strict rules. Since there have to be rules, there has to be enforcement of rules. And, in turn, since there has to be enforcement of rules, enforcement must be firm, fair and efficient rather than weak and arbitrary. If it is not, the system will lose public support. The system we have today is not firm, it is not fair, and it is not efficient. It is weak and it is arbitrary. And it is losing public support. Some people feel this doesn\u0092t matter. They would rather I didn\u0092t talk about it. They are wrong. A democracy that sets rules and doesn\u0092t enforce them loses the respect of its own citizens and the international community. A system of law that is arbitrary and unfair will break down. A tolerant, welcoming society too weak and inefficient to determine whom it wants to welcome will decline into an intolerant and unwelcoming society. By itself, of course, the asylum crisis is not big enough to do this. It cannot destroy something as robust as British democracy and rule of law. But it can damage the rule of law and establish deeply damaging precedents. In other words the crisis in the asylum system damages many things that we value most dearly about our country. It damages many of the very things that distinguish this country from the places refugees are fleeing from. And when there is such a crisis, the Conservative Party will speak out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/19/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-19T00:36:00Z","webTitle":"Thank you, England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/19/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/19/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","fields":{"headline":"Thank you, England","bodyText":"In my grandfather's 1920 wedding photograph, he stands awkwardly, looking something of an impostor in an all too obviously rented topper and tails. That photo was taken in London several years after he successfully wormed his way (as some might put it these days) into Britain. Fetching the picture out now, I think: \"Were you a bogus asylum seeker, grandpa?\" It is a dismaying question to find running through the mind, because I had always previously felt quite straightforwardly towards those in authority who had let my grandfather, Abraham Levack, in off the dockside. My longstanding emotion can be summed up very simply. Thank you, England. Now the airwaves are heavy with the most malevolent descriptions of asylum seekers and their dirty ways. \"Flooding\" is the word I'm sure I heard Ann Widdecombe use on the radio one morning. The tabloids are baying, and a Labour home secretary is issuing demeaning vouchers and talking of tough measures against foreigners. William Hague promises a \"removals agency\" to speed the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers and the Daily Mail hires Paul Johnson as his cheerleader: \"I salute Mr Hague for the courage and vigour with which he has broached the issue.\" Johnson assures respectable England in large type that \"the problem of asylum seekers is now the biggest issue in British politics. It affects all of us\". Is it people like my family that he means to define as \"the problem\"? I suspect it is. When my grandfather arrived, he and his brothers could not speak a word of English. And they were not alone in that. The hired gun Paul Johnson himself, flying a much more tolerant flag in his book, A History of the Jews, describes vividly the apprehension he fancies to have been aroused by the appearance in the west of that vast crowd of would-be migrants from Russia: \"These two million refugee Jews were overwhelmingly Yiddish-speaking, Orthodox or Hasidic, wild-eyed and frightened, superstitious, and desperately poor.\" They were described as \"alien hordes\". This was the first modern mass refugee movement. Britain at the time had an open-door policy that allowed any destitute foreigner in without controls. But not for long. Soon it passed its very first immigration law - the Aliens Act of 1905. Its purpose was to exclude as many as possible of these poor Jews from Russia. To that extent, all the arriving \"asylum seekers\" were regarded as \"bogus\" (as we would put it today). They were not allowed to land without a permit from an immigration officer, and could thereafter be expelled for poverty, criminal convictions, or vagrancy. Professor Saskia Sassen from the University of Chicago, one of the most authoritative analysts of world migration flows, points out: \"This act made a distinction between refugees and immigrants; its perspective on refugees was one of political activists or revolutionaries suffering persecution, not masses of poor persecuted people. The Jews were not seen as refugees.\" And the passage of the act had been promoted by years of violent press attacks on these \"bogus\" arrivals. In 1888 the Manchester City News wrote: \"Their unclean habits, their wretched clothing and miserable food enables them to perpetuate existence upon a pittance... They have flooded the market with cheap labour.\" The Mail of those times carried reportage about the arrival of my foreign family and those like them that was even more venomous than its equivalent today. In 1900, its reporter described the passenger liner Cheshire docking in Southampton with \"600 so-called refugees\" among its passengers. \"There were Russian Jews, Polish Jews, German Jews, Peruvian Jews: all kinds of Jews, all manner of Jews. They fought and jostled for the foremost place at the gangways; they rushed and pushed into the troopshed, where the mayor of Southampton... had provided free refreshments. They had breakfasted well on board, but they rushed as though starving at the food. They cursed if they were not quickly served, they helped themselves at will, they thrust the children to the background, they pushed the women... they jostled and upset the weak, they spilled coffee on the ground in wanton waste. \"Incredible as it may seem, the moment they were in the [rail] carriages they played all manners of games at cards, staking sovereigns on a single card. These were the penniless refugees, and when the relief committee passed by they hid their gold and fawned and whined and... asked for money for their train fare.\" My grandfather - as you might expect - told a very different story. Although there were aspects of my own family's flight which did not fit perfectly with the preferred notion of the political refugee, their whole exodus was plainly brought about by the excesses of the Romanov regime and Tsar Nicolas II - \"that wicked tyrant\", as my grandfather referred to him. Abraham Levack and his parents originally lived in Lipcon, outside the town of Kishinev, near the river Pruth which divided Romania from Ukraine as it ran down towards the Black Sea. Their lives were pretty hellish by the sound of it. Successive tsars had sought to shore up the popularity of the crumbling Russian state by bullying and impoverishing the Jews, herding them into reservations, banning them from many occupations, blocking them from education, and conscripting their sons into the lowest ranks of the tsarist army. In 1881 came a first wave of pogroms in Ukraine, with mobs attacking more than 100 Jewish communities. It reverberated as far as England itself, where humanitarian protests were met with the smooth tsarist explanation that popular hostility to the ways of the Jews had led to spontaneous misbehaviour. The authorities certainly intended to stamp it out, they said. The pogroms continued intermittently. The hero of the family was my great-grandmother, Hannah Goldstein. It was she who ran the small holding, with the cow to make cheese for sale, on which the family subsisted. It was she who bore six children. And it was she who was left destitute - still breast-feeding my grandfather at the time - when her husband Solomon Levack injured his leg and contracted gangrene. In 1896, it took him a month to die in a primitive hospital. Hannah Goldstein had got her eldest son out to London at the age of 18 to save him from being drafted into the Russian military. Her 16-year-old daughter followed. Finally, in 1901, she got herself out - illegally - with the rest of the young children. She bribed local Russians who we should today call racketeers, or human smugglers, and they hiked for three nights, until they got past the border guards and safe into Romania. Hannah Goldstein had been wise to run. In 1903 came the big pogrom in Kishinev itself. The details are still commemorated in the history books. While police stood idly by, and Russian newspapers were censored, 45 Jews were killed, and nearly 600 injured and 1,500 homes destroyed by the mob. Hannah's flight was the start of a desperate wandering through Europe that lasted for the next six years, first in Austria and then in Frankfurt, and finally in Holland, in Rotterdam. The plan was to sail to London. \"They charged Â£5 per person,\" my grandfather Abraham recalled in later years. \"That meant Â£25 for all of us, but we didn't possess that much.\" Another two years passed before the grown-up children in London could save the cash from their meagre wages and send it across. The refugees' luckier compatriots made it to New York, the true destination of choice for those huddled masses yearning to breathe free. England was always second best. But at last my family got on the boat. They fetched up in the tenements around Brick Lane, part of the swarm of 200,000 Russian Jews who crammed for sanctuary into the east end of London. Thank you, England. But how did the 12-year-old Abraham Levack, his brothers and his mother, beat the hostile provisions of the 1905 Aliens Act and talk their way in? I consulted Nicholas Blake QC, one of England's most prominent immigration lawyers. He pointed out they must have been able to persuade the authorities that they weren't going to be a burden on the state. And they weren't. By God, they weren't! My illiterate grandfather went to school for the first time in his life - to the Jewish free school organised by his own community - for just two years, until he was 14. They taught him to read English, and offered to allow him to stay on until he was 16. It was a hard blow when Hannah Goldstein refused to let him have any more schooling. She needed him to earn money. He wrote to me years later as an old man, saying sadly: \"I very much regret that I had no opportunity to have the fortune of having a good English education, to which I was looking forward so much.\" He underlined the words \"so much\". Instead came a lifetime of ill-paid work - as a shop boy on a bike; helping a cap manufacturer; and finally, 31 years in a hat factory. For that, he became entitled to the old-age pension and lived to the age of 90. Thank you, England. The little Levack family clearly had an ambivalent status back at the dockside in 1907. Many of the general public certainly saw them as \"bogus asylum seekers\" - dirty, illiterate and dangerous; taking the bread out of English mouths. But the new regulations designed to shut them out were relatively porous. After demonstrating years of tenacity, and dragging themselves, sometimes illegally, across the whole breadth of Europe, my forebears did get in. Would they be treated better or worse today, if they turned up on Jack Straw's doorstep? The Russian Jews would have received the same sort of hostile reaction from the Mail and the other tabloids that the Gypsies and the Kosovars get at present. My grandfather and his foreign-looking brothers would no doubt be once again accused these days of picking pockets in any spare time they had left over from raping English girls and spreading diseases. But what about the government? Certainly in some respects, they'd have treated my family much worse while their cases were assessed. If the Home Office had their way, they'd be packed off to some remote part of the country far from friends and support; forced to live on inadequate and humiliating \"asylo\" vouchers; forbidden to work; and denied a speedy decision on their case. As Nicholas Blake points out, the government would also now like to count against my family's request for asylum the two years they spent in Holland, waiting for the boat fare. \"They'd say, 'No way, Jose' and suggest you went back there.\" With its large Jewish population for support and absence of persecution, Rotterdam would be classed as a safe haven. No need to come to England. But it might nevertheless be possible to argue successfully against such a ruling, because we had two close family members already in the UK. In which case, everything would turn on whether we had a \"well- founded fear of persecution\". Poring over the checklist of the questions modern adjudicators must ask themselves, which the Home Office now publishes, I would have thought my grandfather must have had a sporting chance of success on those grounds. Every case has to be looked at \"in the round\", and there's plenty of room for discretion. But the Russian authorities were continuously mistreating the Jews in his \"country of origin\". No doubt of that. All in all, then, my grandfather - who was an absolutely genuine refugee from persecution - would probably still get eventual asylum in this country if he arrived today, just as he did 93 years ago. But he would only be allowed in after enduring both a bad dose of media hostility, and treatment from the Labour government that is in some ways worse than that dished out to suffering migrants in the primitive days of 1907. For that, then, thank you, England. First and second generation Britons talk to Pippa Crerar about how their families came to the United Kingdom Zadie Smith novelist \"My mum grew up in Jamaica. Her mum left there when she was seven - to come here to work. Mum stayed behind and was brought up by her grandmother, who died in 1969. So then mum flew to England, aged 15, went to school for two years, then became a typist. She didn't feel England made things easy for her, but the feminist movement gave her different opportunities from what she would have had growing up in the Jamaican countryside. Mum always had problems getting a flat - it was the same after she married my dad, who's English. Julia Neuberger rabbi \"My grandfather came over from Frankfurt in 1906 to work for his uncle's merchant bank, and my father was born here. My mother came from Germany fairly freely just before the war when she was 22, to be a domestic. Friends lent her money so her family could come over and wouldn't be reliant on the state.The rest of her family perished. I think if people are really fleeing from persecution and terror we are obliged to help them. If my parents had come to Britain under today's system, being white would have helped, and also my father's money.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/apr/20/uk.northernireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-20T15:35:56Z","webTitle":"Former minister in secrecy protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/20/uk.northernireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/apr/20/uk.northernireland","fields":{"headline":"Former minister in secrecy protest","bodyText":"A former government minister will today put pressure on Jack Straw by releasing documents of his own meetings with the Irish government that would be remain secret for 30 years under the freedom of information bill. Lord Dubs, the former Northern Ireland environment minister, will use documents on road safety obtained by the Guardian under the Irish freedom of information act to argue that the home secretary must rethink his ban on the release of policy documents under the bill. The former minister intends to brandish the documents during today's House of Lords second reading debate on the bill, with Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister, already anticipating a rough ride on Labour's contentious legislation. Revolts are expected over proposals to allow Cabinet ministers to veto the release of information; refuse to publish the facts behind policy making; and keep secret information obtained during criminal investigations. Mr Straw looks certain to capitulate in one area, by deciding that no council leader or mayor can override Elizabeth France, the new information commissioner, if she orders the release of documents. Lord Dubs intends to show fellow peers policy and briefing papers on a meeting he had in 1998 with the Irish transport minister, Noel Dempsey, to tighten up road safety measures between the republic and Northern Ireland.

Lord MacDonald of Tradeston, or Gus to his friends, used to walk the 11 miles from Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse in Glencoe when he was a teenager in Glasgow. He and his fellow apprentices would go up there to stretch their legs after another week in the shipyards. Forty years on, the minister of transport likes to make it his first big walk of the season, starting at the ancient Inveroran Hotel, where walkers and climbers have replaced the cattle drovers of the old days. This route was also used by General George Wade for his military road into the Highlands in the 1720s, and is now part of the West Highland Way. You start among the old Caledonian pine trees around Loch Tulla and its islets, then strike uphill across the shoulder of the 3,250ft mountain of Stob Ghabhar. \"The path is quite gentle, but you have the great bowl of the mountains all around you and it's very bleak - no shelter for six or eight miles, not even a tree, so if you get caught out it can be pretty miserable,\" says MacDonald. \"But on a good day, it's beautiful, and at the right time of year you can hear the deer in the corries. You can't see them, but they make this strange, deep braying noise, which can sound quite eerie. In the 1620s, James VI used to go hunting here for the rare white deer.\" This area, called Black Mount, is connected to the Fleming family whose most famous member was the creator of James Bond. \"Then you come to the highest part with a great view of the mountains, and you can see as far as Schiehallion, a great pyramidal shape over in Perthshire. And after that, you begin to drop down into Glencoe which, if you're a MacDonald, has a special and sombre significance. Glencoe is Scotland's most doom-laden valley where 37 of MacDonald's own clan were massacred by the Campbells and English troops in 1692. \"Sometimes, when it's raining and cloudy, there can be nowhere sadder and more gloomy than Glencoe. As you come down, you see the White Corries, where they have the ski-lift to take you to the tops, and beyond them is Buchaille Etive Mor, which I think translates as the great shepherd of Glen Etive.\" It's a moderate walk of four to five hours ending at an inn, which claims to be the oldest in Scotland, in Kingshouse at the head of Glencoe. MacDonald likes to go with his wife and old friends from Glasgow: \"I just enjoy the physical effort of it, and I love the hills and mountains with which Scotland is particularly blessed. \"I lived in London from the 1960s to the 1980s and when I went back to work for Scottish TV in 1985, being near the mountains again was one of the best things about it. And you get so many changes in the weather, four seasons in a day sometimes, and such wonderful skies rolling across from the west.\" Scotland's open policy Access to the countryside in Scotland is about to go through a revolution that will give people wider rights than in most European countries and could set a radical precedent for the future in the rest of the United Kingdom. While people in England and Wales will soon have legal right of access to open and uncultivated land - the so-called right to roam - the Scots are looking forward to being granted access everywhere, including cultivated farmland, forests, riverbanks and the coast. A draft bill proposing these rights will be introduced to the Scottish Parliament in the next few weeks, and the backing of the Executive - a Labour-Liberal coalition - and the Scottish National Party makes it virtually certain it will become law. What is perhaps most surprising is that the main representatives of land owners support the legislation, which is based on the unanimous recommendations of an Access Forum which brought relevant bodies together and deliberated for 18 months. The legislation creates a mirror-image of the situation in England and Wales, where there is no access to private land unless a right of way is established or conceded. In Scotland, it's expected that that access will be limited only for reasons of privacy and environ mental protection, and the challenge will be to manage it successfully. A vital part of the new bill will require local councils to establish and maintain a \"core network\" of paths, especially near towns and cities in the Lowlands, where it is felt that comparatively few routes for walking, cycling and riding are available. \"The effect is likely to be a huge change in attitude,\" says Dave Morris, director of the Ramblers' Associa tion Scotland. \"Users will be a lot more confident once they have this right to go anywhere, providing they don't do any damage, while landowners will have the responsibility of accepting that freedom and welcoming people. \"It shouldn't be too difficult - the Duke of Buccleuch is the biggest landowner in Scotland and he's been operating on that basis for years. \"People coming to Scotland with loads of money to buy up land will be told that people will have access to that land and this is something they'll have to deal with.\" Meanwhile, pressure groups in England and Wales are looking beyond the imminent \"right to roam\" legislation and preparing to push for right of access to riverbanks and woodland as well. Many recognise, however, that access to the heavily-cultivated farmland in parts of England might prove more difficult.

While people in England and Wales will soon have legal right of access to open and uncultivated land - the so-called right to roam - the Scots are looking forward to being granted access everywhere, including cultivated farmland, forests, riverbanks and the coast. A draft bill proposing these rights will be introduced to the Scottish Parliament in the next few weeks, and the backing of the Executive - a Labour-Liberal coalition - and the Scottish National Party makes it virtually certain it will become law. What is perhaps most surprising is that the main representatives of land owners support the legislation, which is based on the unanimous recommendations of an Access Forum which brought relevant bodies together and deliberated for 18 months. The legislation creates a mirror-image of the situation in England and Wales, where there is no access to private land unless a right of way is established or conceded. In Scotland, it's expected that that access will be limited only for reasons of privacy and environ mental protection, and the challenge will be to manage it successfully. A vital part of the new bill will require local councils to establish and maintain a \"core network\" of paths, especially near towns and cities in the Lowlands, where it is felt that comparatively few routes for walking, cycling and riding are available. \"The effect is likely to be a huge change in attitude,\" says Dave Morris, director of the Ramblers' Association Scotland. \"Users will be a lot more confident once they have this right to go anywhere, providing they don't do any damage, while landowners will have the responsibility of accepting that freedom and welcoming people. \"It shouldn't be too difficult - the Duke of Buccleuch is the biggest landowner in Scotland and he's been operating on that basis for years. \"People coming to Scotland with loads of money to buy up land will be told that people will have access to that land and this is something they'll have to deal with.\" Meanwhile, pressure groups in England and Wales are looking beyond the imminent \"right to roam\" legislation and preparing to push for right of access to riverbanks and woodland as well. Many recognise, however, that access to the heavily-cultivated farmland in parts of England might prove more difficult."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/2000/apr/22/britishidentity.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-22T22:54:26Z","webTitle":"Forever Ingerland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/22/britishidentity.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/apr/22/britishidentity.comment","fields":{"headline":"Forever Ingerland","bodyText":"St Patrick's Day, an annual excuse to sink a Guinness or three and come all over Celtic. St Andrew's Day is toasted by piper and a helping of haggis. St David's Day, when grown men can be seen with a daffodil pinned to the lapel, no doubt dreaming of the leek soup they have to look forward to. But St George's Day, who gives a damn? In fact most left-leaning Guardian reader pals of mine don't just ignore our national day, they are hard-pressed to even name the date, and when they do finally remember it (actually it is tomorrow) they come over all awkward and agitational about the very idea of celebrating Englishness. \"Long to reign over us, happy and glorious\", the Great British national anthem that is still sung so lustily by the English in place of our own tune, says it all really. We wallow in our subjecthood, unable to break free from an anything-but-United Kingdom. Our independence becomes translated into cutting ourselves off from Europe, the last stand of the little Englander. Who would want to bother with all this baggage? But the creeping realisation that England isn't the same as Britain is becoming irresistible. Hardly surprising when the past 12 months have witnessed the opening of the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the still faltering steps of a Northern Ireland peace settlement. Things are changing at a statist level, yet it is in popular culture that the shift has a real sense of the English dynamic. The nostalgia pics of England's 1966 World Cup triumph show a sea of Union flags in Wembley's stands. The championship mascot was a distinctively British lion, World Cup Willie, complete with Union flag on his chest. Thirty years of hurt later and Euro '96 Wembley was a sea of St George Cross flags. (\"Ingerland!!\"). Not a result of diktat or instruction, but a realisation from below that, at least on the football field, the Scots are a foreign nation and England stands apart. From expensive Hackett knitted St George Cross jumpers, to a traditional kitchen designed by the company Plain English, via Sir Terence Conran's latest eating emporium, the George, Englishness has a growing sense of its own fashionable identity. But how can we celebrate it? An all-day showing of Norman Wisdom, Tony Hancock and Fawlty Towers may help even the most self-loathing of the English to realise that for every Bernard Manning or Jim Davidson making a notorious living out of a cruel laugh at others' expense there is a comedy classic founded on our ability to laugh at ourselves. \"Don't mention the war\", or the bumbling bank manager turned wartime antihero Captain Mainwaring - if this isn't the English lightening up, what is? As for food, we love to knock our national non-existent cuisine. But a regional mix of Lancashire hotpot, Yorkshire puddings and cockney jellied eels, rounded off with some Devon clotted cream and scones, suggests a country made up of difference. Perhaps a St George's Day meal should be a double helping of chicken tikka masala and takeaway pizza in tribute to our intestinal internationalism. Or maybe chips with everything? Culinary historians teach us that these are in fact a continental invention, probably Belgian, though their preference for mayonnaise over Heinz tomato ketchup as the spuds' topping has proved an import too far. The fact that our national vegetable dish isn't authentically English doesn't pull down the entire edifice of our emerging national identity. After all, St George himself was a knight of Middle Eastern origin who probably wouldn't pass muster as a genuine refugee or asylum seeker in these hate-filled times. Raymond Williams was one of the first to recognise that England as a \"mongrel nation\" is a potential source of its enduring appeal. Williams was part of a group of 50s historians and cultural theorists who made it their business to engage with the specificities of being English alongside a dogged determination to break up Britain. Writers of impeccable leftist credentials such as Edward Thompson and Christopher Hill were joined later by Tom Nairn, Perry Anderson, Sheila Rowbotham and others in uncovering a history that might help us construct another England. The Fabian Society, from deep within the New Labour edifice, has launched its report, The English Question, a prescient attempt to link this radical championing of an alternative Englishness with the goal of some measure of English devolution. But England shouldn't be reduced simply to constitutionalising. Feeling good about being English is a vital part in bidding farewell to Britain. Not to forget our imperial past, Rule Britannia's ugly refrain \"Britons never shall be slaves\" speaks to a history that will forever be stained. It is time to turn this legacy on its head with a positive blast of Blake's Jerusalem. A passionate call for a new England free of exploitation and pollution which has a multi-faith, and non-faith, resonance well beyond its Christian origins. A rousing rendition will more than likely be helped in its enthusiasm, if not its melody, by sharing in a round of our great national drink, beer. Eccentrically labelled ales such as Theakston's Old Peculiar, Bishop's Finger and the Mordue Brewery's Radgie Gadgie have their place alongside our liking for European wines and continental lagers. The national and the international co-existing in one party six-pack. The soundtrack to my celebration of St George's Day? Well most of Britpop is in fact Eng-pop, Blur and Pulp being the most obvious exponents of a southern, and a northern, sense of being English yet part of a fast-moving world culture. Drum and bass, jungle, and a dose of new Asian dance music all sound like a national culture that can absorb and include as well as it can repel and exclude. A homegrown dance music play-list is a testament to an Englishness that is urban, yet enjoys itself in a rural festival site and joins the European youth-tribe in Ibiza every summer just to prove its cosmopolitan credentials. Of an age when the music can start all sounding the same, I'll stick to Billy Bragg, the Clash's English Civil War and Steel Pulse's Brum reggae mix for my favourite English party tunes. And if I get round to baking my celebratory fairy cakes topped with an icing sugar St George's Cross I'll have the party food, and my masculinity, sorted. Meanwhile the big picture writers tell me every step on the way towards globalisation is matched by a parallel intensification of localisation. Internationalism is only possible in the face of globalisation once we know where we are coming from. Learning to celebrate St George's Day is a small yet significant part of that process. It is about all our yesterdays, it is for a better tomorrow too.

Most of the real problems I've had with teeth have been inflicted directly or indirectly by dentists and generally it is asking for trouble to visit a dentist for a 'check-up' because usually some unnecessary treatment will be undertaken at no small expense - NHS or private - to the patient. There are two sources of totally reliable and quite inexpensive dental treatment in my experience - the military dentists I saw during the war and school dentists, both of whom can be relied upon not to do anything that is not absolutely necessary. The moral is obvious. Dennis Scott Poole Dorset Professor Aubrey Sheiham's views are well-known within the dental profession. However, the vast majority disagree with him. It is widely recognised that the United Kingdom has the most cost-effective dental service in the western world. The public are now advised by their dentist to go for check-ups at least once a year unless they need to go more often. Some people will choose to go more regularly. These visits are useful in reinforcing messages about good oral health. Dentists have been heavily monitored by the Dental Practice Board since the inception of the NHS. A Harris poll for the BDA in 1999 found that nine out of 10 patients are happy with the care and treatment they receive from their dentist. If they felt that they were receiving inappropriate treatment, this figure would be a lot lower. John Renshaw Chair of the British Dental Association's Executive Board London W1 I am concerned that you gave publicity to Professor Sheiham and his controversial views on fellow colleagues. The use of phrases like 'numerous dental procedures are ineffective, etc' can be seen almost word for word in a Daily Mail article as long ago as 1988. Professor Sheiham and I crossed swords in a BBC television programme over his continuous and protracted attack on the British dentists, since coming to this country from South Africa in the 1970s. A past President of the General Dental Council, the late Sir Rodney Swiss, said in response to one of Professor Sheiham's outbursts: 'It would be a pity if ground were to be lost by listening to advice given far from the experience of day-to-day dental practice.' Having so little respect for his British colleagues, I wonder why he stays. Certainly, in his role as an academic he will be spared the danger of stress (UMIST research shows dentistry to be the highest stress factor of all health care professions) and suicide, where dentists come second to the veterinary profession.

As Nigel Lawson could no doubt testify, opinions of treasury overlords can change and change rapidly, with today's brilliant exponent of economic management becoming tomorrow's scapegoat for failure. Certainly, there are the stirrings of an anti-Brown backlash in industry, where the feeling is that the chancellor is spending far too much time fiddling around with marginal tax rates and benefit schemes and too little on the growing imbalances in the economy caused by the over-valued pound. Most of the arguments for and against Labour's economic strategy have been well rehearsed, and Easter Monday is perhaps not the best time to repeat them. Instead, courtesy of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, let's see what the economy of England was like when the Domesday Book was compiled more than 900 years ago. We can do this because the Australian economist Jim McDonald has written a paper for the institute's latest review on the English economy early in the second millennium. Studying the Domesday Book returns for Essex, he found there was a William de Warene, an Aubrey de Ver and a Peter de Valognes but no Gordon le Bruin, which may have been Duke William's loss because the economy of 11th century England was riddled with the sort of structural rigidities that the present chancellor wants to eradicate. William was a big-picture man. He came over in 1066, stuffed Harold at the Battle of Hastings, culled the Saxon nobility, built a string of castles to defend his kingdom, and parcelled up small bits of land owned by the English to hand out in big chunks to his lords. They were then left to get on with running them - before McKinsey consultants provided expensive advice - as they saw fit. Had there been an International Monetary Fund in 1086, William would no doubt have told it that his tough early action against the Keynesian Anglo-Saxons had abolished the boom-bust cycle and created a platform for long-term growth. Now it was up to risk-takers and entrepreneurs to make the most of the wealth-making opportunities. As with Labour in 1997, the economy William inherited was in pretty good shape. According to McDonald, England was one of the wealthiest countries in northern Europe with an economy based on agriculture, wool and fisheries. The administrative infrastructure was sound and there was an effective taxation system. The Robin Hood tales have given the impression that tax after the conquest was arbitrary, with kings extorting from downtrodden peasantry or feudal lords whatever sums they happened to feel like levying and paying no attention to ability to pay. Modern studies of the Domesday Book have suggested that this image may be entirely false and that the taxation system in the 11th century was economically rational, with assessments closely related to income and resources of the manors. One economic historian, Graeme Snooks, compares Saxon and Norman systems of taxation favourably to Mrs Thatcher's poll tax debacle, saying that the one was an example of an absolute monarch grappling with the political and economic realities of his time, while the other was irrational and inequitable. Although the economy of Norman England was feudal and manorial, Snooks says that there was a vigorous market sector and up to 24% of GDP was exported - not that different from the 30% of today. With a labourer on 2d (0.8p) a day, there was no need for the 11th century equivalent of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to worry about growth in earnings. Snooks says that growth between 1000 and 1200 reached 0.6% - higher than the 0.4% to 0.5% per annum in the first 50 years of the industrial revolution. In the days before mechanisation, this was a pretty creditable performance. Perfect territory But, according to McDonald, it could have been a whole lot better. As somone no doubt said at the time, England had some world-class feudal demesnes but a long tail of under-achievers, where productivity was poor, the labour market was inflexible and policies for education and training were straight out of the Dark Ages. Perfect territory for a Gordon le Bruin and his henchman Edward de Balls. England was not simply a subsistence economy at this time, with feudal lords needing to generate a surplus both to pay taxes and so that they could trade their surplus agricultural produce for tools, military hardware, lead, glass, textiles and fine clothing. But the model McDonald has constructed using data in the Domesday Book found huge disparities across estates in Essex. The study assumes that 11th century production was characterised by constant returns to scale - that is if one plough team resulted in one unit of output, two plough teams would mean two units of output. Under McDonald's calculations, estates are measured against those on the frontier of what was possible, given an efficiency measure of 1. Measures ranged from 0.159 for Paglesham, an estate of Robert Corbutio in the hundred of Rochford, to a perfect 1 for 96 estates; 25% of estates had an efficiency measure of 0.435 or less, the median value was 0.625, and 25% had a measure of 0.861 or better. Mean efficiency was 0.643. This makes it sound as though 11th century production was woefully inefficient. In fact, it compares favourably with other more recent studies of cotton plantations in the American South after the civil war and of Californian fruit growers in the 1970s. \"Statistical tests showed that efficiency values vary significantly with the tenant-in-chief, supporting the idea that such chiefs operated their estates at different efficiency levels according to their entrepreneurial flair,\" McDonald said. The results showed that larger estates tended to operate closer to the frontier and those specialising in grazing livestock were also more efficient. But factor markets were poorly developed, there were few opportunities for substitution of capital, labour and land inputs, and the marginal productivity of an extra unit of labour could be zero. \"If the productivity of villeins was higher on one estate than another, there was potential to increase total output by increasing use of villeins on the more productive estate and reducing use on the less productive estate.\" McDonald estimates that, if input factors had been mobile, an increase in total net output of 40% would have been possible. So what conclusions can we draw from this? First, some problems never go away. Second, markets were probably better developed in the 11th century than generally believed. Third, if there is not a document in the public records office somewhere saying that the centre-left government of William the Conqueror has eschewed both tax-and-spend policies and laissez-faire in favour of a long-term effort to close England's productivity gap with its main rivals, there should be. â¢ Larry.Elliott@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/apr/24/northernireland.mondaymediasection","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-24T14:47:15Z","webTitle":"Why Ulster got spiked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/apr/24/northernireland.mondaymediasection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/apr/24/northernireland.mondaymediasection","fields":{"headline":"Why Ulster got spiked","bodyText":"It could have been that scene from the Hollywood movie where the alert passing cop stumbles upon the nervous getaway driver loitering outside the bank. You know what happens next. The cop holds his gun out and shouts: \"Police, freeze, get out of the car.\" Except this was Belfast in 1990 and what happened next was a bit more deadly. Without giving any warning, a soldier from the 14th Intelligence Company stuck his 9mm Browning through the open driver's window and blew the suspect's head off; firing eight rounds at near point-blank range. (The driver, it turned out, was unarmed.) Hearing shots, the driver's fellow robbers rushed out the front door of the bookie shop in the Falls Road that they were in the process of robbing and were promptly shot dead. Both men were wearing balaclavas and carrying highly realistic imitation weapons - a fact of which their killer was almost certainly aware. One robber was finished off, SAS-style, with a few rounds to the head as he lay helpless on the pavement. A fourth member of the gang survived by hiding among the bookie shop customers. A couple of days later, the Northern Ireland secretary of state Peter Brooke stood up in parliament and said the passing soldiers had chanced upon what they thought was an armed IRA terrorist gang when the robbers wearing their balaclavas jumped out of the getaway car and ran into the bookie shop. They had no option but to engage the gunmen. It was an important story. Three men, Eddie Hale, John McNeill and Peter Thompson, were dead, killed in a British city by British soldiers. But Ulster was a turn-off, boring, no one cared. There was little sympathy on Fleet Street for a group of foolish west Belfast petty criminals who styled themselves \"the hole-in-the-wall gang\" and who had crossed paths with an elite British special forces unit. No one on the newsdesk was going to waste money sending someone over for a dead story about dead terrorists. But then that was nothing new. I had heard that same mantra during my entire reporting career, which began in Belfast in 1983. There were always a dozen reasons why it was never the right moment to go over and do that awkward story. Ireland was dull, dull, dull. No one wanted to know. Both at the time and in retrospect it was an astonishing response. Ireland's Troubles lasted for nearly 30 years. It was and is the longest-running domestic news story. It brought murder and mayhem onto the streets of the capital city - London - and cost 3,500 lives. A government-sanctioned hit squad on the streets of a British city was not an eight-par page-five filler. It should have been huge, but in fact it hardly got covered at all. On the other hand it's not so surprising. The Troubles may have taken place in what is legally an integral part of the United Kingdom, yet the reporting record there of British journalism, with very few exceptions, is entirely disgraceful. US television and the press may have stopped the war in Vietnam, but the reverse is true in Ulster where the abdication of journalistic integrity allowed the war to go on unhindered by a free press. As Ireland's Troubles recede into memory it's worth asking why it all went wrong. If one of the roles of journalism is to inform the public, then 30 years of British journalism in Ulster singularly failed to do so. This failure was most pointedly evident in the reporting of the IRA, the key protagonist. For decades British newspapers, and particularly the Sunday Times and the Daily Mail, parroted the black propaganda myth - originally promoted by the British army - that the IRA were \"criminal godfathers\", \"psychopaths\" and bloodthirsty killers. There was little analysis of the political structure of the IRA, its organisation, or the nature of its support base. But then of course psychopaths, ipso facto, cannot be organised. Nor was there any sustained attempt by British reporters to go and ask IRA men why they had joined up. There were notable exceptions, the Guardian's David Beresford and David McKittrick of the Independent disproving the general rule. Of course many of those others who did try would often find that their copy never managed to make it into the paper back home. By the time I joined the Ulster trail in 1983, the tabloid press had almost entirely abandoned Ulster as a news outpost, leaving just the broadsheets to reluctantly carry copy on our Irish province. The Troubles were reported, most prominently on the BBC, in a piecemeal staccato fashion - one killing at a time with no attempt at dangerous analysis. Everyone in the state bureaucracy of the BBC remembered the row with home secretary Leon Brittan over the controversial documentary programme At the Edge of the Union, which showed Martin McGuinness being nice to his kids. News reports kept to two favourite clichÃ© scripts \"tit-for-tat\" and \"pleas for no retaliation\". It made it all sound like a boring but deadly unintelligible board game. It is said that journalists read everything and believe nothing, but somehow Ulster turned it around. Fleet Street collectively read nothing but then believed everything it was told by government. But when peace broke out, Fleet Street was floundering. Instead of being at the forefront of the story they were miles behind. The revelations that the British government had been secretly negotiating with IRA terrorists for nearly a decade came as a total shock. It is clear that the rapidity of the peace process and the apparent professionalism of the Sinn Fein/ IRA political machine had taken most senior British newspaper executives by surprise. And we are still in the odd situation where both right- and leftwing leader writers are left trailing behind the government's radical agenda on Ireland. Not every newspaper executive was a government dupe, and someone did send me to Ulster for the \"hole-in-the-wall gang\" story. No Fleet Street news editor, and certainly no one from the BBC, had questioned Brooke's account or the remarkable coincidences that gave it coherence. Wasn't it odd that the soldiers just happened to be passing when the robbers jumped out of their car? And was it not a bit strange that the robbers would wear their balaclavas running into the bookie shop rather than just pulling them over their heads as they entered the narrow shop doorway? It did not take much reporting skill - I interviewed the fourth gang member - to find the holes in the official account. Far from being a chance encounter, the gang had been under surveillance by squads of 14th Intelligence Company members as they retrieved their imitation weapons from a hide. Those weapons had almost certainly been \"jarked\" - bugged and examined - and discovered to be imitation by the undercover soldiers. The gang had been followed to the bookie shop and then ambushed, possibly in the belief that they were IRA men. Put more simply, the men were killed on the orders of a military command system whose rules of engagement were determined directly by the government. Although we will never find the piece of paper with the words written down, the order ran something like this: \"Known or suspected IRA terrorists caught near illegal weapon dumps, or in the act of committing a criminal offence can be summarily executed.\" And it was an order that was enacted time and time again in Ireland. In controversial circumstances an inquest jury in 1997 concluded that the men had been killed lawfully. As in many \"shoot to kill\" operations in Northern Ireland, the Director of Public Prosecutions concluded that the soldiers should not be prosecuted. A lot of people might say IRA terrorists, and the petty criminals in the hole-in-the-wall gang, deserved to die. Perhaps they did. But it is usual in democratic societies to have a bit of a debate before we grant the government the right to organise extra-judicial killings with impunity. But there was never that kind of debate in Britain because no one ever told the British people what was going on. For all the blather by generations of British news editors that Northern Ireland was boring, this obscure example from the Troubles illustrates the obverse: that for the British State the war in Ireland was far too important to allow a democratic press to question the actions of its assassination squads. And so over time it conscripted, cajoled and co-opted the press into seeing the world from pretty much the same viewpoint as the government. The failure of British journalism in Ulster is one lesson from the Troubles that we should not forget. â¢ A new edition of Kevin Toolis's book on the IRA, Rebel Hearts: Journeys Within the IRA's Soul, is published by Picador, price Â£7.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2000/apr/25/furthereducation.theguardian3","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-25T01:17:28Z","webTitle":"We are the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/apr/25/furthereducation.theguardian3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/apr/25/furthereducation.theguardian3","fields":{"headline":"We are the future","bodyText":"Most people would agree that we value the academic over the vocational more in theory than in practice; after all, when your pipes burst, it is the plumber not the philosopher you want to see coming through the door. The world of academia has its place, but in order to keep the wheels of industry and commerce turning as we race into the information age, our country needs the best trained, best qualified and most highly skilled workforce achievable. Right now - with the experiments of the past behind us and a huge amount of experience accumulated, particularly over the last 20 years - our relatively young vocational training industry is well place to deliver to employers and individuals the quality of practical education and training that both groups of customers respectively demand and deserve. The present model of work-based training has been achieved by taking the most successful models from other countries and then - over 20 years of trial and error - moulding them to meet the particular requirements of the United Kingdom and its employers. The work-based method of preparing young people and adults for employment opportunities, and upskilling and developing them within their careers, has proved beyond any doubt to be the most successful and cost-effective system in existence. A structured and supported plan of learning for the individual, coupled with real work experience on an employer's premises, enables the learner to develop their own capabilities in the world of work with the employer giving them their own particular slant on the skills and the culture required for their enterprise. This concept is supported and actively encouraged by government, industry and commerce - and it works. The Association of Learning Providers (ALP) was born last December, when a group of providers and representatives of established networks spontaneously decided to join together as a unified voice for all public, private and voluntary sector training organisations. It is a \"network of networks\", able to work closely with the government and government departments, both with employers and the large number of other agencies concerned, to drive forward solutions to strategic and policy issues, and to help achieve a truly world-class workforce for the United Kingdom. The only two criteria for an organisation's involvement with the Association of Learning Providers are that it should be delivering work-based training and that it should be in pos session of contracts with one or other of the government funding agencies. The association is totally inclusive, embracing the best interests of all providers and of the many hundreds of thousands of young people and adults for whom providers are directly and daily responsible. It concerns itself as little as possible with institutional structures, but devotes its energies to addressing the issues of the day. The Learning and Skills Council will soon replace all Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and will be operational by April 2001 with its 47 local outstations, all of which will work to a common pattern. This entirely new structure will have a Â£6bn annual budget and amongst many other responsibilities will be the government agency for managing vocational education and training in England for young people over the age of 16. There will inevitably be slightly different arrangements in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ire land, with Scotland currently undergoing a review of its training and enterprise agencies. The actual delivery will be in the hands of the 2,500 providers, covering both geographical areas and the vast array of skills required by employers. Many of these learning providers are very small and make invaluable contributions in niche markets, covering every skill imaginable within their own local communities - from upholsterers to signwriters; from wood turners to beekeepers; from photographers to silversmiths. The largest work nationally, with many thousands of young people and unemployed adults on their multiplicity of programmes. Providers deliver programmes varying from help for the disadvantaged or those with special training needs, right through the spectrum of National - or Scottish - Vocational Qualifications at level 1 up to level 5 (degree standard). They come from the public, voluntary and private sectors; all basically delivering the same series of products and all with a part to play. It is, over the years, the providers, working with others, who have developed all government programmes; who are the interface with schools and the careers service, and who recruit unemployed and employed clients - knocking on doors and going out into the highways and byways to involve employers large and small. They carry out induction and careers counselling; arrange work placements with employers; match clients to the jobs available; and in particular engage small businesses in the training process, with local labour market intelligence being updated daily. The providers create job opportunities, and act as the normal recruitment agency for young people, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of employers, mostly small businesses, and deliver the entire training, assessment and internal verification processes, working with other agencies and acting as de facto training managers for small businesses. They develop quality and best practice in every aspect of their work; provide all administration and pastoral care for clients from 16 to 65 years of age -soon to be from age 14 due to changes in the national curriculum. They work in partnership with employers towards successful outcomes, normally jobs and vocational qualifications. There is no need to look for the new next big thing. We already have the delivery system in place. All we need to do is to use it. â¢ Hugh Pitman - whose family has provided leaders in vocational skills training for individual development and business improvement since 1812 - is Chairman of the Association of Learning Providers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/apr/25/election2000.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-25T14:34:38Z","webTitle":"Winners wanted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/25/election2000.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/apr/25/election2000.uk","fields":{"headline":"Winners wanted","bodyText":"The debate about electoral reform for Westminster is in the doldrums; Labour is taking its time deciding what to do with the report commissioned by Tony Blair from Lord Jenkins. Yet however slow the pace at Westminster, people throughout the United Kingdom are getting the chance to see for themselves how proportional representation (PR) works. Next week Londoners vote for a new Greater London assembly, using the additional member system. A year ago, Scotland and Wales voted for their new devolved institutions using a similar system. What voters make of these experiences will influence how the country votes if and when we are asked to give a verdict on Jenkins in a referendum. Research by the Economic and Social Research Council Centre for research into elections and social trends, and the constitution unit at University College, London, shows what people in Scotland and Wales make of PR in the wake of the first devolved elections. The chart shows various propositions to do with PR - for the most part the Scots and the Welsh welcome their new system. But even so, come a decision on PR for Westminster, the opponents of reform still have some telling arguments in their armoury. The idea that PR is too complicated receives little support. Only around one in ten people in Scotland and Wales say that the new ballot papers were difficult to fill in. Doubtless we could expect a similar proportion to say the same thing if we asked about about first past the post ballot papers, too. Voters do find it difficult to work out how the seats are allocated under PR. No less than three in five say that it is very or fairly difficult to understand. But there is no evidence that those who found it difficult were any less likely to go to the polls than those who did not. The lower-than-hoped-for turnout in the devolved elections cannot be blamed on voters' distaste for PR. Meanwhile many of the arguments commonly used in favour of PR do get an endorsement. More than half the people of Scotland agree the new system is much fairer than first past the post. Fewer than one in ten disagree. Nearly two thirds agree that there is more point voting under the new system - only 6% disagree. Support is somewhat more muted in Wales but here too far more agree than disagree with these claims. At the same time some of the arguments put forward by the opponents of reform are rejected. Just one in six agree that the new voting system gives too much power to small parties, nearly a third in Scotland disagree. The same is true of claims that it will lead to unstable government. Indeed, despite the relatively critical press with which the Labour- Liberal Democrat coalition in Edinburgh was greeted, 51% of people in Scotland believe coalition is better for Scotland. Only 41% favour single party government. Electoral reform even appears to be more popular now than it was before devolution was implemented. In 1997 just over half of Scots backed PR for their new parliament. But by the time of the first Scottish election, two-thirds were in favour. There has been a similar rise in support for the use of PR at Westminster too. True, much of this movement appears to have occurred at the time of the devolution referendums rather than elections themselves, but it seems the arguments used in favour of PR during the devolution debate resonated with voters. Not all is rosy in the PR garden. So-called closed lists, under which voters choose a party rather than an individual candidate, are unpopular. Twice as many say they would prefer to vote for a candidate than not. Fortunately for the pro-PR camp, Jenkins has proposed \"open\" lists for Westminster. Voters clearly like the idea of having their own local MP too. In both Scotland and Wales nearly two in three say they would prefer to have just one MP for their area rather than several MPs as part of a larger area. Yet multi-member constituencies are an inevitable feature of any proportional system. Again perhaps it is fortunate for advocates of reform that Jenkins proposes as little disturbance to the idea of the local MP as possible. But above all many voters still like the idea that elections produce a clear winner, and regard this as more important than securing a \"fair\" result. In Wales there is a clear 51% to 36% majority in favour of having a clear winner rather than a fair result, while in Scotland as many back a clear winner as a do a fair result. So even after experiencing PR in action voters in Scotland and Wales do not necessarily have consistent views. Consequently their attitudes towards reform of elections to the House of Commons de pends entirely on how they are asked. Well over half agree that PR should be introduced so that the number of MPs each party gets matches more closely its share of votes. But well over half also take the view that we should keep the existing system because it produces more effective government. Electoral reform appears to have many good tunes. But they will need to be played well if the public are to be persuaded that Westminster should follow the path that London, Scotland and Wales have already trodden.

All judgments are interim. All events, even such accidents as the discovery of Donald Dewar's heart problem, have the potential to teach both the citizens of Wales and Scotland and the rest of us something about the range and staying power of the new governing institutions. At this early stage in its life the Scottish executive deserves some plaudits. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have forged a civilised partnership. Over student fees they made a workable compromise from which Westminster could learn. But the carping audible in Edinburgh has also been justified. Sir David Steel, presiding officer of the parliament, has taken upon himself responsibility for the cost overruns and delays in housing it in a new building, but he shares the charge with Donald Dewar's cabinet, which has been secretive in the worst traditions of London government. Now the executive faces an unwonted test. Mr Dewar will have to undergo major surgery which will keep him out of the loop for months - and if his party and political friends have any regard for his health they will make sure he is indeed kept out while recuperating. The first minister's mantle passes to Jim Wallace while Labour's leadership is taken by Henry McLeish. They have complementary political talents and this episode ought to provide good evidence of the longer-run durability of the coalition. As well as we wish Donald Dewar, he is inevitably a transitional figure. His political generation made devolution an imperative for the Blair government. It will be up to their successors to make the parliament as a governing institution. Mr Dewar bequeaths one issue which has not been well handled - the capture of Clause 28 by Perthshire moralists in the shape of the Souter family. Brian of that ilk is organising a private plebiscite. Here is an opportunity for the Scottish cabinet to speak, as it is not yet done, with self-confident belief in their country's modernisation, for its emancipation from Knox and kailyard bigotry. That will require Messrs McLeish and Wallace to forget their partisan obligations and muster their forces. Mr Dewar's (temporary) disappearance creates space for the epigones to get out there and campaign. The media, critical to date, likes a scrap. The executive has a chance to show its appetite - for reshaping Scotland as only legitimate national leaders can."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
