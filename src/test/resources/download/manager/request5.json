Mr Cubie has consulted widely and imaginatively. But Scottish attitudes towards access to higher studies are firm. He will find it hard not to reflect the majority view and recommend a break with Labour's UK-wide policy on grants and fees. This week, in a consultation paper preceding the recommendations he expects to make in December, he anticipated an end to compulsory (partial) tuition fees by putting a price on once more making higher education free to all qualified entrants. Some clever massaging of the arithmetic produced a remarkably low figure, £12m, which even the parsimonious Donald Dewar could live with. Rejecting Cubie would not be easy - it would surely jeopardise the coalition. Accepting Cubie would inaugurate a period during which Scottish students, parents and colleges did things differently from elsewhere in the UK. This could be a fascinating exercise in precisely the comparative policy-making that devolution promised. Yet Cubie has wider significance. Even his provisional figuring for Scotland is enough to expose the financial legerdemain and the political cowardice at the heart of Labour's policy for the universities throughout the kingdom. At Bournemouth, Tony Blair pledged to increase enrolments to 50% of the late teen age group. He did not specify whether they would carry with them any extra public money. But such \"non-traditional students\" are going to be highly sensitive to the costs of study and need maximum support. The premium in lifetime earnings secured by graduates is likely to fall, making their indebtedness at the start of their careers more onerous. Either employers, parents or loan-burdened students pay more or universities charge less, which surely means further cuts in quality and the reliability of the degrees they offer. The present system of student support is not going to last. And so the Cubie inquiry's modelling and calculations become relevant. On them depend informed discussion of how the government's admirable ambition of expanding higher education is to be reconciled with its refusal to make taxpayers confront the price or force employers and graduates into shouldering a fairer share of the cost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/oct/30/maevkennedy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-30T15:11:21Z","webTitle":"A lesson in lost property","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/30/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/oct/30/maevkennedy","fields":{"headline":"A lesson in lost property","bodyText":"British museum directors are to be offered guidelines for the first time on how to handle the increasing demands for objects from collections to be returned to their rightful owners. Experts believe all directors will eventually be forced to consider their moral, as well as legal, title to all their objects, and could face demands for the return of up to 10% of their collections. The campaign to force the British Museum to return the Elgin Marbles, taken from the Acropolis in Athens in 1799, has dragged a taboo subject into the open: the 200-year-old controversy is about to be publicly reviewed for the first time by a parliamentary select committee. Dozens of museums are attempting to deal with similar requests - particularly for objects with religious connotations in ethnography collections - without any official guidance from government or museum professionals. Objects already sent back include the Ghost Dance Shirt originally taken from the corpse of a Sioux warrior at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890, which was returned by Glasgow Museums to the Sioux people after a public inquiry. Quite how large a tranche of British collections could be affected in the future is not clear. Mark O'Neill, director of Glasgow Museums, believes it could be as much as 10% for museums with large ethnographic collections, while Moira Simpson, a lecturer at Warwick university, the first academic to carry out a systematic study of the problem, believes that, based on the American experience, it would be under 2%. The subject is so sensitive that the British Museum and the V&amp;A refused to take part in Ms Simpson's study, which was carried out for the Museums Association. However the Guardian has studied the history of the key objects from the British Museum collection, showing how war, missionary zeal and colonial conquest brought them to London. Many museum directors have flatly denied that any restitution requests have been made. But the combination of the Elgin Marbles debate, the international campaign for restitution of Nazi war loot, and the impending examination of the subject by the heritage parliamentary select committee has forced them to grasp the nettle. Nothing to lose The government-funded Museums and Galleries Commission is to publish the first official guidelines, giving museums advice on how to handle such requests. \"I don't accept the floodgates theory, that museums are suddenly going to be deluged with requests and left with yawning empty glass cases all over their galleries, but it is inevitable that more will be made over the next decade,\" Timothy Mason, commission director said. \"Most objects in collections have been properly and responsibly obtained, and museums have nothing to lose by debating openly what has been a very secretive subject.\" The guidelines, a draft of which has been seen by the Guardian, demonstrate the varied and often dubious routes by which objects have arrived in British collections: the subjects that need to be considered are \"aftermath of war and conquest; theft or wrongful taking; illegal excavation; illegal field collecting\". Museum directors are urged to consider the status and source of the request, such as national museums, culturally affiliated groups seeking objects of spiritual or symbolic importance; and indigenous groups seeking items which may have commercial potential or intellectual property rights. The guidelines urge them to remember that instead of a blanket ban on anything leaving a collection, some objects might benefit from being seen in a different context, while information technology makes continued research access easy. What might have seemed a remote academic argument literally landed on the doorstep of dozens of British museums last summer when they received postal requests for the return of objects from the tiny Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Almost 250 years after Captain James Cook - who donated scores of objects to British museums - landed briefly on one of the islands, an English ethnographic curator, David Devinish, is helping establish a museum there. He has written to every British museum with an ethnography collection: only one small Scottish museum is believed to have sent anything back. \"Museums have nothing to fear from this process,\" she said yesterday. Ms Simpson said yesterday: \"In many cases you are talking about hurt feelings, about people who feel their own cultural history has been stolen from them, and displayed without any acknowledgement of their contribution.\" In some cases she found that requests were resolved by a paper transfer of ownership, with the object remaining on display in the museum. In the case of some religious objects the original owners \"believe these objects have a life, and must breathe, and would smother in plastic wrapping - just taking off the plastic may be enough to resolve the difficulties\". One of the bitterest international disputes has been over the Benin bronzes, made from the 16th century in a tiny city state in what is now Nigeria, and taken by a British military expedition in 1897. While the African Restitution Movement website labels the British Museum's bronzes as \"stolen\", the Horniman museum in South London's new African gallery, the first in a national museum in Britain, displays them with the full agreement of the Benin people. Mr O'Neill, who returned the Ghost Dance Shirt, said: \"It's all about values and ethics. A shirt that was ripped off the body of a dead Sioux had no business in our collection. We no longer have the shirt, but the story of its return is now part of Glasgow's history, a memory of an act of generosity.\" Prize objects in the British Museum and how they got there The Benin bronzes Punitive war loot. The small city state, now part of Nigeria, cast bronzes of unrivalled quality from the 16th century on. A British \"punitive\" expedition in 1897, revenge for a Benin ambush in which nine British officers died, sacked the royal palaces and brought back a shipload of bronze, auctioned in London by the admiralty to cover the costs of the expedition. The Elgin Marbles Greek, 5th century BC. Bought from the Ottoman rulers of Greece, dismantled by Lord Elgin in 1799, and then recovered from a shipwreck, in a hugely expensive operation which left him deeply in debt. Bought by the government for £35,000, and deposited \"in perpetuity\" in the museum in 1816. The Rosetta Stone Egyptian, 196 BC. War loot twice over. Its trilingual inscription enabled first translation of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions. Taken in 1799 by a sharp-eyed French lieutenant who plucked it from use as a building stone for a Napoleonic fort in the Egyptian desert. Ceded to George III by Treaty of Alexandria in 1801; given by him to the museum. The Lewis chessmen Probably Scandinavian, walrus ivory, 12th century, when the Outer Hebrides were part of the kingdom of Norway. Finest medieval chess set in Europe. Confused records of discovery, 93 pieces found buried in a sand dune in Uig in 1831, possibly in a stone lined burial chamber. Some in National Museum of Scotland. Isle of Lewis council has repeatedly requested the return of the set The head of Rameses the Great Egyptian, 1270 BC. Presented by J L Burckhardt but taken from its site at Thebes by Giovanni Belzoni, a circus strongman turned professional antiquities hunter. Belzoni's memoirs record that he had to smash several other sculptures to get at it Assyrian winged bull gateway From Khorsabad, modern Iraq, about 710BC. French and English teams, excited by the biblical connections, competed to excavate thousands of tonnes of carved stone from the Assyrian palace sites in the19th century. These huge stone figures were bought for the museum in 1850 by the soldier-scholar-diplomat Henry Rawlinson under licence from the Ottoman empire - a transaction now disputed by scholars Easter Island statue Cult image, made between 11th and 17th centuries. 18th century visitors including Captain Cook recorded the giant statues still standing, many destroyed. Surviving examples now re-erected on island, major tourist at traction and World Heritage Site. This statue collected by British survey ship HMS Topaze in 1868, presented to Queen Victoria by the Lords of the Admiralty, and by her to the museum Statue of A'a French Polynesia, 18th century. The sculptor Henry Moore was so impressed as a poor student by the wooden statue of the god covered in creeping frogs, that he commissioned a bronze replica for his home when he became wealthy. Given by Christian converts to missionaries in the 1820s, bought by the museum from the London Missionary Society in 1911 Mexican Rock Crystal Skull Solid rock crystal skull, regarded for a century as unique survival of pre-Spanish conquest Mexican Aztec art, and as such a national treasure which should never have left Central America. Recent studies have revealed cut marks made by a European jeweller's wheel, suggesting it may be 19th century.

How do you explain a love and logic at the heart of the universe when the world is so out of kilter with this? Has free will got us crucified? And what about the dodgy characters who inhabit the tome known as the Bible, who hear the voice of God? Explaining faith is impossible: vision over visibility; instinct over intellect. A songwriter plays a chord with the faith that he will hear the next one in his head. One of the writers of the psalms was a musician, a harp-player whose talents were required at 'the palace' as the only medicine that would still the demons of the moody and insecure King Saul of Israel. It is a thought that still inspires: Marilyn sang for Kennedy, the Spice Girls for Prince Charles. At the age of 12, I was a fan of David. He felt familiar, like a pop star could feel familiar. The words of the psalms were as poetic as they were religious, and he was a star. Before David could fulfil the prophecy and become the king of Israel, he had to take quite a beating. He was forced into exile and ended up in a cave in some no-name border town facing the collapse of his ego and abandonment by God. But this is where the soap opera got interesting. This is where David was said to have composed his first psalm - a blues. That's what a lot of the psalms feel like to me, the blues. Man shouting at God - 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me?' (Psalm 22). I hear echoes of this holy row when un-holy bluesman Robert Johnson howls, 'There's a hellhound on my trail' or Van Morrison sings, 'Sometimes, I feel like a motherless child.' Texas Alexander mimics the psalms in 'Justice Blues': 'I cried Lord my father, Lord kingdom come. Send me back my woman, then thy will be done.' Humorous, sometimes blasphemous, the blues was backslidin' music but, by its very opposition, it flattered the subject of its perfect cousin, gospel. Abandonment and displacement are the stuff of my favourite psalms. The Psalter may be a font of gospel music, but for me it's despair that the psalmist really reveals and the nature of his special relationship with God. Honesty, even to the point of anger. 'How long, Lord? Wilt thou hide thyself forever?' (Psalm 89), or 'Answer me when I call' (Psalm 5). Psalms and hymns were my first taste of inspirational music. I liked the words, but I wasn't sure about the tunes - with the exception of Psalm 23, 'The Lord is my Shepherd'. I remember them as droned and chanted rather than sung. But they prepared me for the honesty of John Lennon, the baroque language of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, the open throat of Al Green and Stevie Wonder. When I hear these singers, I am reconnected to a part of me I have no explanation for - my 'soul' I guess. Words and music did for me what solid, even rigorous, religious argument could never do - they introduced me to God, not belief in God, more an experimental sense of GOD. Over art, literature, girls, my mates, the way in to my spirit was a combination of words and music. As a result, the Book of Psalms always felt open to me and led me to the poetry of Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, the book of John \u0085 My religion could not be fiction, but it had to transcend facts. It could be mystical, but not mythical. My mother was Protestant, my father Catholic. Anywhere other than Ireland that would be unremarkable. The 'Prods' at that time had the better tunes and the Catholics had the better stage-gear. My mate Gavin Friday used to say: 'Roman Catholicism is the Glamrock of religion' with its candles and psychedelic colours - cardinal blues, scarlets and purples - smoke bombs of incense and the ring of the little bell. The Prods were better at the bigger bells, they could afford them. In Ireland, wealth and Protestantism went together. To have either was to have collaborated with the enemy - that is, Britain. This did not fly in our house. After going to Mass at the top of the hill, in Finglas on the north side of Dublin, my father waited outside the little Church of Ireland chapel at the bottom of the hill, where my mother had brought her two sons. I kept myself awake thinking of the clergyman's daughter and let my eyes dive into the cinema of the stained glass. These Christian artists had invented the movies. Light projected through colour to tell their story. In the Seventies the story was 'the Troubles', and the Troubles came through the stained glass, with rocks thrown more in mischief than in anger. But the message was the same: the country was to be divided along sectarian lines. I had a foot in both camps, so my Goliath became religion itself: I began to see religion as the perversion of faith. I began to see God everywhere else. In girls, fun, music, justice and still - despite the lofty King James translation - the Scriptures. I loved these stories for the basest reasons. These were action movies, with some hardcore men and women, the car chases, the casualties, the blood and guts. There was very little kissing. David was a star, the Elvis of the Bible, if we can believe the chiselling of Michelangelo. And unusually for such a 'rock star', with his lust for power, lust for women, lust for life, he had the humility of one who knew his gift worked harder than he ever would. He even danced naked in front of his troops - the biblical equivalent of the royal walkabout. David was definitely more performance artist than politician. Anyway, I stopped going to churches and got into a different kind of religion. Don't laugh. That's what being in a rock'n'roll band is. Showbiz is shamanism, music is worship. Whether it's worship of women or their designer, the world or its destroyer, whether it comes from that ancient place we call soul or simply the spinal cortex, whether the prayers are on fire with a dumb rage or dove-like desire, the smoke goes upwards, to God or something you replace God with - usually yourself. Years ago, lost for words and with 40 minutes of recording time left before the end of our studio time, we were still looking for a song to close our third album, War. We wanted to put something explicitly spiritual on the record to balance the politics and romance of it; like Bob Marley or Marvin Gaye would. We thought about the psalms - Psalm 40. There was some squirming. We were a very 'white' rock group, and such plundering of the scriptures was taboo for a white rock group unless it was in the 'service of Satan'. Psalm 40 is interesting in that it suggests a time in which grace will replace karma, and love will replace the very strict laws of Moses (in other words, fulfil them). I love that thought. David, who committed some of the most selfish as well as selfless acts, was depending on it. That the scriptures are brim full of hustlers, murderers, cowards, adulterers and mercenaries used to shock me. Now it is a source of great comfort. '40' became the closing song at U2 shows, and on hundreds of occasions, literally hundreds of thousands of people of every size and shape of T-shirt have shouted back the refrain, pinched from Psalm 6: 'How long (to sing this song)'. I had thought of it as a nagging question, pulling at the hem of an invisible deity whose presence we glimpse only when we act in love. How long hunger? How long hatred? How long until creation grows up and the chaos of its precocious, hell-bent adolescence has been discarded? I thought it odd that the vocalising of such questions could bring such comfort - to me, too. But to get back to David, it is not clear how many of these psalms David or his son Solomon really wrote. Some scholars suggest that the royals never dampened their nibs and that there was a host of Holy Ghost writers. Who cares? I didn't buy Leiber and Stoller - they were just his songwriters. I bought Elvis. • The Book of Psalms, with this introduction by Bono is published tomorrow by Canongate as part of a new series of pocket canons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/nov/04/chrismcgreal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-04T01:12:07Z","webTitle":"Gold crisis exposes seam of suspicion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/04/chrismcgreal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/nov/04/chrismcgreal","fields":{"headline":"Gold crisis exposes seam of suspicion","bodyText":"It is said that there are only two important institutions beyond the reach of the government of Ghana, and both have Ashanti in their names. President Jerry Rawlings's efforts to impose his candidate for monarch of the powerful Ashanti kingdom six months ago fell flat when the oligarchy crowned someone else. The president was said to be particularly angry with the head of the other Ashanti empire - the gold mining company - who threw his support behind the new monarch. Now the struggle is on for the control of Ashanti Goldfields. A financial crisis has left the company, Ghana's biggest source of hard currency, vulnerable to a foreign takeover. The government has responded by trying to assert greater influence over a company which has steadfastly refused to play political ball. The crisis has already cost the minister of mines his job, and provoked a strange rescue offer by a Saudi prince. It has also indirectly roped in the Queen, for the government is trying to use her visit to Ghana this week as an endorsement of President Rawlings's policies. The crisis has baffled most Ghanaians, because it was brought on by a sharp increase in the gold price just weeks after Ashanti laid off 2,000 workers, ostensibly because gold prices were tumbling. As a precaution against gold falling further, the company more than a third of its future production at a guaranteed price. When gold shot up $75 an ounce to more than $325 (£198), those who had contracted to buy the future production made what is known as a margin call to Ashanti to deposit more than $300m. It did not have the cash. As the company scrambled to win a grace period from its creditors, Lonmin, the mining rump of Tiny Rowland's Lonrho, launched a bid for control of Ashanti Goldfields. It already owns about a third of Ashanti, and the two companies had been discussing a merger for more than a year. But as Ashanti faced its cash crunch, Lonmin saw an opportunity to snatch the prize. The takeover bid is regarded with suspicion by the government, which is afraid that it will further undermine its influence over Ashanti Goldfields. Lonmin plans to merge the Ghanaian company with platinum mines in South Africa under a single company headquartered in London. Ashanti would be a subsidiary with limited control over its mines in Tanzania, Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa. Perhaps the greatest mystery of the crisis has been the arrival of a Saudi prince, al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud. The prince, who has a stake in a big Ghanaian bank which owns nearly a fifth of Ashanti Goldfields, offered to help rescue the company from the margin call. No one, including the government, is clear whether he was offering to put up the money for the margin call or trying to take over the company. But barely a word has been heard from him since his initial offer. Personal hostility Meanwhile, the government quietly agitated for a change of management at Ashanti. Its criticism focused on Sam Jonah, the chief executive and a protege of Mr Rowland. As one political analyst in Ghana observed, the company has long been too independent for the taste of Mr Rawlings's government. \"To have your biggest company refusing to give money to the party is never popular in Africa. Ashanti has refused to let itself be bled by the government or used to improve its image,\" he said. \"Rawlings has an extreme dislike of Jonah. The government is now saying that, because of this crisis, maybe Jonah's legendary talents are limited. This is their chance to get rid of him and install a management more friendly to the government.\" But the government's agitation goes beyond concern about the company. Mr Rawlings has made no secret of his hostility to Mr Jonah. They were once friends, but the selection of the Ashanti king appears to have confirmed the president's fear that Mr Jonah poses a political threat to Mr Rawlings's National Democratic Congress (NDC). Mr Rawlings cannot stand again in next year's general election and the NDC has been struggling to find a credible candidate. It is expected to nominate Professor John Evans Atta Mills, Mr Rawlings having ruled his wife out of the race last week. Prof Mills is neither charismatic nor in command of a particularly large personal following. But neither is the opposition New Patriotic Party's candidate, JA Kufour. Mr Jonah, on the other hand, is highly respected by Ghanaians for overseeing the growth of Ashanti Goldfields into one of the biggest mining companies on the continent. Not only is it big, it is reputedly well run. Mr Jonah's confidants say he has no intention of standing for the presidency but, with the Ashanti king's selection fresh in political minds, he does not rule out his influencing what may prove to be a closely-fought race between two weak candidates. The government's effort to undercut Mr Jonah has focused on Ashanti's talks with Lonmin. It says it was not kept fully informed, despite two cabinet ministers sitting on the company's board. But James Anaman, Ashanti's corporate affairs manager, says the government has no cause for complaint. \"This is not a government company,\" he said \"We don't tell everything to them. As a company listed in New York and London we must be careful with the information we release. The law prevents us from favouring one shareholder over others. We are scrupulous in seeing that all our shareholders are treated the same when it comes to information.\" A fortnight ago Mr Rawlings dismissed the mines minister, Fred Ohene-Kena, after he tacitly endorsed the Lonmin bid in public. Mr Ohene-Kena was both a private member of Ashanti's board and the minister responsible for the industry. The government owns 20% of Ashanti, and a \"golden share\" which allows it to veto major decisions. But it has to be careful about how it handles Mr Jonah. One of the reasons for Ashanti's credit problems is the perception that it is vulnerable to political interference. A successful bid to remove Mr Jonah could significantly undermine confidence in the company. The government is keen to be seen as guarding the national interest. The president of Accra's chamber of mines, John Bentum-Williams, says Ghanaians are suspicious of greater foreign control. \"Ashanti means a lot to them politically,\" he said. \"They see it as a gift for all Ghanaians. They view gold mining as a God-given national heritage. Any government disposing of it as a national asset has a problem. Any change has to be structured in a manner that it isn't seen as selling it out.\" The government is also keen to distract attention from the increasingly gloomy economic prospects before the elections. A fall in many commodity prices and a rise in the cost of oil have left their mark. The currency has lost nearly a fifth of its value this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/nov/05/dvdreviews.reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-05T00:54:22Z","webTitle":"Video releases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/nov/05/dvdreviews.reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/nov/05/dvdreviews.reviews","fields":{"headline":"Video releases","bodyText":"Besieged Retail, £15.99 Alliance Atlantis Cert PG **** A two-hander directed by Bernardo Bertolucci inevitably rekindles memories of the director's infamous Last Tango in Paris, but Besieged could hardly be more different. Sex plays very little part here and, where the earlier film was overpoweringly about Brando, this takes the female point of view. It's a simple but subtle film set in Rome about an African housekeeper and a mysterious resident Englishman who gives the odd piano lesson. Not a lot gets said - the director gives his actors lots of room for invention and, since the actors are Thandie Newton and David Thewlis, he's on to a winner. It's rare to see so much conveyed by expressions. Both are on a good run after a few wasted years. For Thewlis, after The Big Lebowski and Divorcing Jack, this is a triple whammy of contrasting roles. Here, he's a rather grand upper-class Englishman struggling to relate to the menial downstairs (significantly, there's an ornate staircase between their living quarters). They're divided too by musical taste: Newton unwinds to music from the homeland, whereas Thewlis's taste is formal and European. Her past is economically explained in the opening sequence. The two have just one key conversation. \"What do I have to do to make you love me?\" enquires an exasperated Thewlis. \"You get my husband out of jail!\" says Newton. Can he? Will he? In a trim 90 minutes, we find out. It's the opposite of an action movie but it's never less than engrossing. The Idiots Rental and retail (£15.99) Tartan Cert 18 *** Viewers of The Idiots should prepare to be puzzled, outraged, amused, disturbed and occasionally moved. It's part of director Lars von Trier challenging \"normal\" behaviour in the same way as Dogme's rules (handheld camera, natural light) challenge \"normal\" film-making - Blair Witch is, accidentally, a Dogme film.\"How can you justify acting the idiot?\" the group's leader is asked. \"You can't,\" he replies. Most of the obvious complaints and moral arguments about a film featuring a group \"spassing\" for its own obscure motives are in the film (\"they're searching for their inner idiot\" is one explanation). Von Trier, who used a real Down's syndrome couple in TV's The Kingdom, is not using fake idiocy for comic effect, as the Farrellys often do (and, lest we forget, that nice Michael Palin does comedy lisps and stutters and no one complains). To throw down another gauntlet, his \"spassing\" group includes an orgy with some undeniably real sex, which would not be allowed in a legal sex film here. At times it does make you yearn to revert to the more uninhibited behaviour of childhood, as well as question society's reaction to different behaviour but it lacks the power of von Trier's desolate Breaking the Waves. True Crime Rental and DVD (£15.99) Warner Cert 15 ** A teaming of Clint Eastwood and James Woods suggests a clash of acting styles that could make even a ho-hum plot worth watching. Sadly, there is only one key scene featuring both (result: jittery 1, laconic 0) and Woods's dynamic presence leaves a vacuum for a melodramatic, predictable plot about reporter Eastwood trying to save innocent and noble Isaiah Washington from a midnight state execution. Eastwood directs himself in a part that seems to have been written for a 40-year-old as a womaniser and ex-drunk. It's a role he plays without enthusiasm but which, ironically, seems tailor-made for Woods, who plays his senior editor. There's the race against time, the Pulitzer prize chat (don't American reporters talk about anything else?) and some perfunctory family stuff for Clint, one of three Eastwoods on the cast list.

There are two programmes, each an hour long. As brevity is the soul of lingerie, shorter would have been better. No doubt the idea was pitched to Channel 5 as big birds in push-up bras but it turned out quite decent, amusing and informative. As the Rev Brontë said \"Girls, girls!

Corsets are immemorial. Mrs Hawthorne remembered discreet cards in windows: \"A Trained Spirella Consultant. Consultant! Where have all the Spirella ladies gone?\" They have jolly reunions like old soldiers where they sing \"Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag.\" That, approximately, was what the Spirella corset did. I went to the closing of the factory 10 years ago and a poignant sight it was too. Sunlit dust sifting down on suspenders with a snap like an alligator, elastic of a strength to send you spinning down the room and bundles of the patented spiral stay which gave the corset its name (\"The same wire that is used in high grade pianos.\") Jerry Lee Lewis could have played Great Balls of Fire on my grandma's Spirella corset, though, personally, I would have advised him against it, The more respectable the speaker, the more entertaining the effect.

And it was Mrs Hawthorne who said disconcertingly \"The posing pouch is something I go for. In fact my husband, a clergyman, was sent one by a grateful parishioner.\" Her smile grew slowly like the Chesire cat reappearing. No, you ask her. I'm not going to. \"The Wonderbra is the Manchester United of bras.\" Discuss, doing your Jimmy Hill impression. Once upon a time there was mustard. No cupboard in the kingdom was without that oval tin and its mustard coloured label. Colman's. If anyone else made mustard, they kept quiet about it. Col Mustard, so to speak, was Sir Jeremiah Colman. Hugely rich from what was left on the side of the plate, he bought a stately home, Gatton Park and built himself a fashionable Japanese garden to wipe the eye of the nobs. Sir Jeremiah leapt to life in the recollection of his staff. \"A very tiny man,\" said Kay, the daughter of his gamekeeper. \"This garden had to match up to anything the king or queen could do. He couldn't bear to be bested,\" said Arthur Hooper, one of his 40 gardeners, \"My wage was 31.6d, yet Jerry Colman could spend £760,000 on the marble hall.\" So they called him Jerry, always a derisory term, behind his back? In 1934 there was a devastating fire. Kay's father wept and couldn't eat his Sunday dinner. In 1942 Jeremiah died and so did his Japanese garden. It took 30 unemployed men to build it in 1910 and, oddly enough, 30 volunteers to help restore it in Lost Gardens (Channel 4). It was poignantly overgrown. A dogged bamboo. A dead cherry. An ivy-strangled ginkgo. Monty Don's team had an unrealistic five days to restore it, and it rained. It looked like Flanders. A dredger stood broken-necked in the mud. The landscaper went down with trench foot. They excavated the buried bones of the garden and replaced the teahouse and the Japanese bridge. It looked a little raw. Nature takes time. Arthur Hooper, like a true gardener, took the long view. \"It's a joy to be back. I think I'd like to see it in three years time.\" He is 90."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/06/books.guardianreview2","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-06T00:59:13Z","webTitle":"Out with a whimper, not a bang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/06/books.guardianreview2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/06/books.guardianreview2","fields":{"headline":"Out with a whimper, not a bang","bodyText":"Watching a ballet company in an out of town matinee will never guarantee you the starriest casts - but it may draw attention to less obvious talents, such as English National Ballet's Yat Sen Chang. Chang is a shortish, stockyish dancer who's more likely to be cast in character solos than romantic leads. But as Solor in Wednesday's performance of Marius Petipa's Kingdom of the Shades at the Apollo Theatre, Oxford, he took appealing charge of the stage. The exquisite, unsullied patterns of this work (which actually forms Act III of La Bayadère) are notoriously exposing for its dancers, yet some careful training carried the corps through their first terrifyingly sustained entrance, and only a few grim-faced wobbles marred the famously dreamy succession of arabesques. It was unfortunate that, in their succeeding numbers, many of the corps looked so subdued - but maybe they were taking their lead from Monica Perego, whose Nikiya appeared peculiarly bad-tempered throughout. It was left to Chang, the only man on a stage full of women, to kindle our enthusiasm, and he did his best, partnering Perego with a sweet-tempered gallantry which outshone his less than classically pure line, and using his athletic jump to draw an airy line of dance that lifted and turned within the music. In a revival of Glen Tetley's 1977 ballet Sphinx, Chang again gave a highly personal, highly charged performance. Tetley's hard-edged, high-gloss choreography portrays a mixed-myth love triangle in which the Sphinx falls under the spell of Oedipus's mortal attractions, watched disapprovingly by the Egyptian god Anubis. Chang, as the latter, danced with a feral muscularity that effected a startling transformation into animal god. When he bared his throat in a brutal jackal laugh, the wildness of it made your skin prickle. Tamara Rojo was also an unusually engaging Sphinx, finding a vulnerable tenderness at the heart of the role, despite some shaky partnering by a handsome but inexperienced-looking Altin Kaftira. Closing the programme was Kenneth MacMillan's 1962 The Rite of Spring, revived with new designs by Yolande Sonnabend. This work hasn't been seen on the British stage for years, and it's enterprising of English National Ballet to bring back what some consider a classic. I have to admit, however, that I'm not among those who do. MacMillan may have risen to the challenge created by his huge cast (more than 40 dancers) to create some extraordinarily arresting patterns - bodies clustered into knots of seething energy or stacked in long jagged lines - but his attempts at creating an elemental language have always seemed to me clownish and lightweight. The dancers' lolling heads, sagging knees and splayed hands never communicated the urgency of a life and death ritual. ENB's men tried to inject some ferocity into their dancing but the women mostly looked flighty. And even a matinee shouldn't feature Joanne Clarke as the Chosen One, helplessly under-powered as she is both in her dancing and dramatic imagination. In the event, what should have been a bold conclusion to an interestingly varied programme turned out to be a disappointing whimper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/1999/nov/07/observerbusiness.marksspencer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-07T00:20:41Z","webTitle":"M&S gambles on foreign suppliers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/nov/07/observerbusiness.marksspencer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/nov/07/observerbusiness.marksspencer","fields":{"headline":"M&S gambles on foreign suppliers","bodyText":"The huge problems facing Marks &amp; Spencer were illustrated again yesterday when the giant retailer announced it was to ditch another UK clothing supplier and look abroad for manufacturers which could provide goods at cheaper prices. Nine hundred workers at Leicestershire-based firm Richard Roberts now face an uncertain future following the surprise move by M&amp;S which is responding to a catalogue of disasters in recent months. A huge marketing drive to promote the retailer's new autumn range of clothing - the first since Peter Salsbury became chief executive - failed to increase sales. Unseasonally warm weather was blamed for consumer apathy. The setback could not have come at a worse time. Having suffered months of criticism from fashion pundits who saw the company's clothing range as boring, the autumn launch had been well received and was seen as a springboard for re-launching the company's fortunes. And a recent aggressive round of price-cutting, in a bid to clear out old stock, also met with little enthusiasm from consumers. The company's latest set of half-year figures, only just announced, showed that the profits were down from £337 million in 1998 to £193 million this year. The company's poor performance has been blamed by some City analysts on its arrogance. It has only just announced that it will accept credit cards in its 294 United Kingdom stores - despite the fact that other high street names have accepted them for years. In addition, it has traditionally eschewed advertising, believing that M&amp;S's stores sold themselves on their reputation. In a bid to turn the company's ailing fortunes around, M&amp;S executives have embarked on a policy of restructuring its supply agreements with its clothing suppliers. Nearly two-thirds of the company's sales come from clothing, and M&amp;S is looking to shave costs by nearly £500 million in an attempt to claw back profit margins. This month M&amp;S announced it was also axing two other well-known suppliers - William Baird and Daks-Simpson, putting more jobs at risk. A Marks &amp; Spencer spokesman said: 'It's never an easy decision and it's not something we take lightly, but we have to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the high street.' However, one retail analyst warned that the move to use foreign clothing manufacturers could backfire on the firm. 'The problem is that it takes a very long time for the goods to get here. 'If you get hit by strange weather you can end up taking a hit. It makes it very difficult to turn your supply on or off.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/07/leaders.leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-07T00:20:50Z","webTitle":"A royal choice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/07/leaders.leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/07/leaders.leaders","fields":{"headline":"A royal choice","bodyText":"At the end of a nail-biting referendum Australia voted to keep the Queen as head of state. The Queen's statement, recognising the right of Australia to determine her constitutional future and vowing her service to the state, was beautifully judged. Adopting a non-political and dignified tone, it exhibited the sure touch for which the result was part-reward. But it isn't over yet. Some who voted for keeping the Queen did so because they were unhappy with the suggested presidential alternative. A clear question - should Australia be a republic? - would almost certainly have produced a different result. The Queen's status will be an issue in their next election. At home, the Australian vote and the end of the House of Lords show combined to create the most republican 'moment' for years. Even the Sun flirted with a call for an end to the monarchy - once the beloved Elizabeth has gone. The Australian vote is good news in the short-term for the monarchy. But the prospect of similar plebiscites across the Commonwealth changes the nature of royal legitimacy. Succession is not enough: the people's consent is needed too. The United Kingdom needs an elected Upper House, a Bill of Rights and a written constitution rooted in the sovereignty of the people. To survive, the monarchy needs to be divorced from the political process and draw on new sources of legitimacy. Charles's willingness to be tested at the altar of public opinion, as we report today, suggests that he knows this. Perhaps there should be a referendum each time a new monarch succeeds? This would give the republicans a shot every generation and keep the Royals on their guard - but in the long run voting is the death of inherited titles. It is clear that yesterday's vote marked the beginning of the debate, not the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/nov/07/life1.lifemagazine3","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-07T00:20:53Z","webTitle":"Tubeway armies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/nov/07/life1.lifemagazine3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/nov/07/life1.lifemagazine3","fields":{"headline":"Tubeway armies","bodyText":"David O'Donnell stalks to the end of the platform, descends a few grimy steps, looks up, frowns and vanishes. He spends much of his waking life in this surreal underworld, bathed in oily half-light and clinging humidity, witnessed by weird funguses and trickles and mysterious chemical reactions that leave burning acid deposits on the walls. O'Donnell's description of the conditions he and his team of London Underground maintenance workers encounter at night had sounded like a war veteran's account of the jungle in Burma, but the reality is more skewed and unnatural than that. There are patrols of ghostly yellow 'ballast' trains and rats the size of cats. Through years of isolation, the mosquitoes have evolved into a distinct species. 'Fluffers' sweep for residues of disc brake, clothing and passengers' skin. Distant cries and clangs echo through the still tunnels like incantations as the workers stumble across all manner of detritus, from discarded stolen wallets to fragments of the many wretched souls who've chosen this place to die. 'We all adapt to the life,' O'Donnell says, 'but no one ever gets used to it.' For the three hours that the current is switched off, between two and five in the morning, an unseen army races to repair the day's damage while the population frolics and slumbers above, oblivious. And they're not alone. Far from it. Every time a Londoner flicks a switch, turns a tap or lifts a receiver, there will be a movement somewhere beneath their feet. This is a place of huge, concealed bunkers and serpentine tangles of cables; of private railways and forgotten stations and networks of hidden tunnels; of miles of neo-Gothic sewers and maze-like catacombs and bizarre, covered rivers and canals flowing right under King's Cross; of hidden citadels and inverted skyscrapers more than 30 storeys deep, bang in the middle of the West End. You can stand on the wire-mesh floor in one of the eight pumping stations for Thames Water's gigantic London Ring Main, which binds the city more imperiously than the M25, and beg your knees not to buckle as you hover 150ft above a whirring, humming void. You feel as though you're perched at the threshold of another world, and in a sense you are. We might think of this teeming unterwelt as the city's unconscious, the known but not known tributary stream to our conscious, overground, everyday lives. Some of our darkest and most extraordinary secrets are hidden here, if you know where to look. This is the city under the city. There is an association called Subterranea Britannica, which claims 500 members. I'd asked one of its organisers, Malcolm Tadd, where his fascination came from. His words had stayed with me: 'When you go somewhere where it's dark, you're aroused, awakened, your senses become heightened. It's like us as people: you've got this tidy world up here, then this muddle down below. And there's always a feeling at the back of your mind that you've got to get out...' Dante, Milton, Cocteau understood this. And at this moment, so do I. I'm trying not to breathe too hard, because the atmosphere is on the foul side of acrid. What the Victorians feared, they either buried or tried to conquer. In fact, sometimes they did both, which is why I am hunched, 50ft under London's crust, thigh deep in water and fetid waste. There are 1,500 miles of sewers like this, egg-shaped so that the contents would run faster lower down, acquiring a scouring action in the process. It was the biggest engineering project of the 19th century and is said still to boast the finest brickwork in the world. At the present time, however, my attention is focused on managing my claustrophobia and trying not to slip on the unspeakable ooze under my feet, because I really don't want a mouthful of what's down there. Then, suddenly, unexpectedly, the tight reflection of our torches explodes into space, and we're entering a huge, open chamber. The whole structure is composed of the most immaculate red brick, and water flows everywhere, tumbling and trickling like a liquid symphony, from raised shelves and fast-moving, discrete channels to a series of sultry tributary tunnels that arc gracefully back into darkness, smooth as a woman's hip. There are elaborate arches and flying buttresses, huge iron doors suspended above us, counterbalanced with 11-ton weights. The scene is not what you'd expect to find here at all, but it's part of an intricate system designed by the engineer Joseph Bazalgette, after the rank waters of the Thames caused the Great Stink of 1858, during which Parliament had to evacuate itself to a more fragrant locale. Bazalgette's plan had previously been deemed too expensive to adopt but, on returning to Westminster, Disraeli miraculously found the necessary £3 million. The result is a neo-Gothic masterpiece: unseen, little known, but breathtaking. A bust of Bazalgette is to be found at the northern foot of Hungerford Bridge. My guide to the sewer, Keith Golledge, tells tales of old timers who know where slight irregularities in the walls cause treasure to catch. He admits that these might be apocryphal. 'We get everything down here,' he smiles, but mostly they get jewellery and guns, buried in silt. Sometimes, they run across dead animals, occasionally people. Once, they found a baby. Golledge and his friends discover the things we don't want in the 'civilised' world above, and they are heirs to one of the oldest occupational groups in London. Eight hundred years ago, 'gong fermors' cleansed medieval cesspits. Before them, townsfolk tossed the contents of chamber pots into the gutter with a cry of 'gardy loo' (gardez l'eau), which is where the word 'loo' derives from. By all accounts, it was well-paid but dangerous work. Pity poor Richard the Raker, who fell into his cesspit and drowned, according to records, 'monstrously, in his own excrement'. Like many venerable cities, much of London's story revolves around the river which summoned it in the first place. The Thames, provider of so much that is good, waged its most merciless campaign of derision against the engineer Marc Isambard Brunel. Brunel was a French royalist who had fled to the US, then to Britain, where he sold boots and pulleys to the British army during the Napoleonic Wars. Afterwards, he went bankrupt, but spent his time in debtors' prison studying the digging method of the common shipworm. Upon his release in 1818, Brunel patented a tunnelling system based on his observations and proposed that it be used to build a tunnel under the river, which would be the first such public tunnel anywhere in the world. If you go to Wapping Tube station, on the north bank, you can descend the brick-lined steel shaft that Brunel started to sink in March 1825. Had anyone suspected at that point that 10 men would die and a mammoth £614,000 be spent before this pioneering project was finished - 15 years later - work would never have begun. Only 14ft of lateral progress had been made when the Thames broke in for the first time, compounding a series of setbacks that included seepages, an explosion, gas-induced illness and two early deaths among the tunnellers. A month later, work was resumed, with Brunel's better-remembered 18-year-old midget son, Isambard Kingdom, installed as chief engineer, but public support for the enterprise was already waning. The Times called it 'The Great Bore'. After a series of additional disasters - the most spectacular coming when the tunnel face caved in, filling the excavated vein with water in 15 minutes and killing more men, while miraculously carrying the younger Brunel up the Wapping shaft to gasping, terrified safety - the project appeared to be dead in the water. Eventually, the government, realising that this was a battle that had to be won, provided the funds to continue and, after much further strife, Queen Victoria opened the first Thames Tunnel in January 1943. Fifty thousand people passed through it on the first day but, within a few years, it had fallen prey to muggers, murderers and prostitutes, who coalesced into London's first literal criminal underworld, and it was closed. A use was ultimately found, though. Travelling from Wapping to Rotherhithe on the East London Tube line, it is through Brunel's haunted legacy that you pass. If you're lucky, David Lawrence, author of Underground Architecture, will take you on a tour of the Underground network. The first line, the Metropolitan, was opened in 1863, with free rides for 700 Victorian notables. Only Lord Palmerston was absent, excusing himself with the saw that he was 'anxious to remain above ground for as long as possible'. The system expanded steadily from there on in, but was re-invented in the early part of the 20th century, a process which had an inestimable impact on the life and culture of London and Great Britain as a whole. The head planner of the Underground Group in the 1920s was a complex man named Frank Pick. Profoundly influenced by the 'medieval modernism' of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement, he harboured a dream of integrating art with everyday life, democratising the culture, forcing commerce to serve society. To him, this meant creating a unified, harmonious architectural style that would give the city shape and would be replicated in the minds of those who moved through it. Art, he believed, could change us. Pick's rise and influence, along with that of Lord Reith, has been seen as the final triumph of the middle class in England. Raised sternly in York, Pick had a character which could scarcely have been more at odds with these romantic principles. He was shy and puritanical, prone to depression and extreme self-criticism. Nevertheless, his vision and vigour were astounding. He set about establishing a house style for the Underground, taking in everything from dustbins and light fixtures to grilles, clocks and ticket machines. He commissioned Edward Johnston's famous bar-and-circle logo, which he hoped would provide a corporate identity for the city as a whole. He wreathed the stations in posters featuring abstract art: fauvism, cubism, surrealism. Advertisers complained, but, having no competitors to worry about, Pick could afford to take risks. The art historian and spy Anthony Blunt claimed that Pick's patronage was a decisive factor in the acceptance of modern art in this country. On his tour, David Lawrence will concentrate on the modernist stations Charles Holden designed for Pick in the mid-1920s. The austere but beautifully proportioned Portland Stone-clad buildings at Borough, Clapham South, Balham and Angel on the Northern Line contain hints of classical Greek and Deco styles, as well as the work of the Dutch modernist Dudok and the Bauhaus school of Germany. They form a distinctive, instantly recognisable hybrid, which was to evolve further still as the Thirties approached, with Holden declaring: 'I have visions of architecture as pure and true as a Bach fugue...' In 1931, Holden and Pick paid a visit to the modernist Berlin system, during which they met with Hitler. Holden's most impressive and adventurous design is found in the sharp, almost ecclesiastic drum of Arnos Grove. As you move from the platform to the escalators, a series of imposing, flaming torch-styled lamps clearly suggests the triumphalist conceits of Thirties fascism. I find myself staring at them for a long time. Pick died in 1941, disillusioned with modern art and the posturings of surrealism, considering himself a failure. There was little extension of the Underground until the Victoria Line of 1967. That doesn't mean that underground building in London stopped, however. The next 20 years were probably the busiest of all, even if the public didn't know much about it. There is a story that the planners of the Jubilee Line extension had their projected route under Westminster rejected several times. They were bemused. There was no obstruction shown on the official drawings, and no one would explain quite what the problem was. There is a theory about this. Contacted for this article, a member of the Research Study Group, which concerns itself with the constructions of the Cold War era, offered the view that 'the situation around Parliament Square is still very uncertain. There is a lot going on, but we don't really know what it is... The rumour is that there is a vast bunker down there, which the government has kept secret, which is the granddaddy of them all.' The investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, veteran of the infamous ABC trial and a specialist in this area, has been looking into the Parliament Square mystery. He thinks he is close to the truth. 'What I didn't previously know was that the government had built two huge bunkers since the War. One was the hydrogen-bomb citadel near Bath. But I didn't spot three clues as to the A-bomb measures. That does amount to a city under London. What fascinates me is that the scale of what was done underneath central London had not been calculated.' Whether this theory is true or not, the fact remains that central London is riven with secret and not-so-secret tunnel systems, bunkers, shelters and underground buildings constructed during the Second World War and the Cold War. Before the War, service corporations had already begun to amass subterranean empires. The Post Office had experimented with passing letters through miniature tunnels as early as 1863, and began work on the precursor to their present 23-mile underground railway, running from Paddington through Mount Pleasant to Whitechapel, in 1913. This is where the Elgin Marbles were hidden during the First World War. Afterwards, they wanted to expand their buried dominion, rather than rent space in London Transport's. The government refused permission, until the detonation of Russia's first nuclear device in 1949 changed everything. Now there was a perceived need for deep arteries to protect communications during a nuclear exchange. The government accordingly agreed to finance the biggest subterranean undertaking since Bazalgette's sewers. In fact, the first serious government-sponsored tunnelling schemes were begun two decades earlier, in the Thirties, when the Cabinet authorised construction of 12 miles of tunnel, linking interconnected war rooms and 'citadels', 100ft under the ground. There were eight citadels, under Dollis Hill, Harrow, Cricklewood, Curzon Street in Mayfair, Carter Lane in EC4, Montague House in Whitehall, Horseferry Road and Horseguards Parade. The Treasury built a reverse office block at Storey's Gate, which ran to 600 acres and was protected by 17ft-thick concrete walls. Altogether, these structures were intended to accommodate 3,000 staff, while local councils were being issued with cardboard coffins for the civilian population and officials debated whether to dump casualties in the Thames or float them into the North Sea should the cardboard solution prove insufficient. No wonder the troglodyte city under Whitehall was kept secret. Chamberlain's government had begun the War determined not to provide deep shelters for the public. Londoners were also instructed not to use Tube stations for shelter, so what they did was to buy the cheapest possible ticket and go down anyway. At its peak, 170,000 people were virtually living in what became makeshift communities, with canteens and libraries. Stumbling across them, the sculptor Henry Moore made a series of solemn but rapt sketches of what he saw, which the writer Iain Sinclair accurately describes as 'like incubating dreams under the city'. Fellow author Michael Moorcock, who has written extensively about London, has happy boyhood memories of these emergency gatherings. 'I used to hope there'd be an air raid when we were out shopping,' he says. 'For a kid, it was just wonderful, because everyone was welcoming and helpful and warm. The police were instructed to keep us out at first, but ultimately refused to enforce their instructions. I've always thought that was marvellous.' Eventually, London County Council dug six trenches for its citizens - the largest at Finsbury, which could hold 12,000 people and is now an underground car park. The government also succumbed to pressure for deep-level facilities, building shelters for 8,000 people each underneath the Tube stations at Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Chancery Lane, and Holden's creations at Stockwell, Clapham North, Clapham Common and Clapham South. They were completed in 1942, but only four were opened to the public. Goodge Street became the headquarters of General Eisenhower, Chancery Lane an invasion citadel for use if London was overrun, and Stockwell a US troops' hostel. All still exist, though the Stockwell and Clapham shelters are unused. Camden Town was employed as a set for Doctor Who, but is now let, along with Belsize Park, to Security Archives Ltd. Security Archives also have possession of the 'Eisenhower tower', the 32-storey inverted skyscraper in Chenies Street, just off the busy West End shopping street of Tottenham Court Road. The entrance, contained in a large, cylindrical shaft that looms over you as you pass by on the pavement, leads to a deep maze of unnervingly long walkways. Some of the gloomy branching chambers are used to store valuable items - there are unreleased John Lennon recordings, sheaves of confiscated child pornography, BBC materials and documents deposited by private individuals - while others have been left as they were when US troops were billeted in them. The ancient machinery and homesick graffiti are strangely evocative in these murky surroundings, your own unease seeming to chime with that of the young men who left it there. Reputedly, a clause in the letting agreement allows the government to regain possession with no notice, at any time. After the epoch-defining Soviet nuclear test, the shelter at Chancery Lane was taken over by the Post Office and converted into the atom bomb-resistant Kingsway trunk exchange (accessed through a plain blue door). It was then linked to new, government-financed 'Fortress London' citadels, with names like Bastion (under Covent Garden), Rampart (Waterloo), Fortress (Moorgate) and Citadel (St Paul's). The honeycomb of interconnecting tunnels traverses the city, still affecting planners. When the backers of the new Imax cinema in Waterloo wanted to deep-pile the foundations, they were told that they couldn't, but were repeatedly rebuffed when they asked why not. Duncan Campbell claims to have infiltrated and cycled through the tunnel which runs underneath. As with the other parts of the defence network, it was rendered useless as an instrument of defence when Brezhnev exploded his country's first hydrogen bomb in 1955. Few people know what its use might be today. If you want a sense of how all this ties in, there's no better place to find it than sitting opposite Roland Paoletti in his Docklands office. As architect-in-chief of the Jubilee Line extension, the next chapter in London's underworld life is in his hands. In a break with tradition, all of the stations on the new line are different. The London of the Twenties and Thirties was the hub of the Empire, 'which is why the stations were similar, why everything was painted red... it was a world of corporate identity - that was the spirit of the age. But I don't really believe that is the spirit of the age in the London of the Nineties.' He wants his stations to be 'more like jazz than chamber music'. The big showpiece sites were relatively easy to produce, he adds. The trouble was finding space under the spectacularly congested Waterloo and London Bridge. He laughs at my amazement that the surface of the city stays on the surface, with so much space gaping underneath it. He thinks it's a joke. 'We had to go very deep with this line, down to 35 metres, even 40,' Paoletti says. It's a very London problem, that - because the characteristics of London don't come from the vision of one planner or architect. It's chaotic down there - you can't believe what's going on. 'The Jubilee Line extension is incredibly interesting in terms of the historic fabric that it goes through. It links up with every other line. At Canada Water, we connect with the East London line, which still runs through Brunel's original Thames Tunnel. We were working in the grounds of abbeys at either end, the old Benedictine one at Westminster and a Cistercian community at Stratford Depot. London Bridge stands at the junction of Roman roads going north and back to Rome - we were digging up all sorts of artifacts there. What we were working with was amazing.' At this stage, Paoletti's enthusiasm is mildly infectious. A visit to the sites leaves me reeling. Canada Water, with its translucent blue tiles and ingenious nods to Holden's Arnos Grove work, is stunning, but stepping into Sir Norman Foster's near-complete Canary Wharf station is an almost religious experience. At 300m long, the tower it shares its name with could be laid flat inside with room to spare. The ceiling hangs 100ft above you, sweeping sinuously down to meet seven towering elliptoid columns, running up the central length of the sunken structure. In the middle and at either end are half-egg shaped glass domes, which allow light to pour in, and a great parade of escalators appears to reach to the sky. It's like a cross between Canterbury cathedral and the set of Aliens. A fitting end to the tour. The purchase on the imagination of this dark inner sphere which so fascinates and perturbs is probably as old as humanity. It has provided a ready metaphor for evil, or, in modern times, dissent. Here is the Underground Railroad, the Weather Underground, Velvet Underground. At the end of my own road, under 15ft of tarmac and earth, runs the River Effra. It snakes along Brockwell Park on the Herne Hill side of Brixton, down the old 'front line' of Railton Road, past the Oval cricket ground and Kennington, before ejaculating into the Thames. A thousand years ago, Canute used it to attack London. Elizabeth I sailed up it to visit Sir Walter at Raleigh House in Brixton. Sometimes, when I walk through the park now, I like to imagine her spirit navigating it still, serene in her private world, protected from the car fumes and bustle above. It must be nice down there, I think."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/09/davidmckie","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-09T14:30:10Z","webTitle":"An honourable man","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/09/davidmckie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/09/davidmckie","fields":{"headline":"An honourable man","bodyText":"You wouldn't expect to hear ministers saying so, given what he has done to them over the past few days, but to many other people both inside and outside the system, Jack Ashley - Lord Ashley of Stoke - leader of the revolt against the government's welfare reform bill, is exactly the kind of person you need in the world of politics to keep it honest and decent. Gently, patiently, courteously, and just as important, knowledgeably, he keeps saying to his government: I'm sorry; this is in many ways an admirable bill piloted through by people I like and respect; but in certain essential provisions affecting disabled people it is simply unjust, and whatever the threats and cajolements, one should not vote for injustice. That isn't what we are sent to parliament for. It matters more because Ashley has never been an all-purpose rebel. Indeed, in the late 70s, when rebellion was building on the left of the party against the Wilson and Callaghan leaderships, he was scoffed at as a leadership patsy, even by some who in this battle have been squarely on his side. It is still his view that the leadership deserves solid backbench support nine times out of then, even 99 out of 100. But sooner or later there has to be an exception, where conscience simply says no. The grossly unfair treatment, as he sees it, of disabled people, a group he especially understands because he is there himself, is just such a moment. The Labour Party used to be about people like Ashley. The son of an office cleaner and a labourer who died when he was five, he first emerged as a very young and sometimes obstreperous councillor in his hometown Widnes, in Cheshire. Having worked as a crane driver, stoker and coal heaver, he came back to education as a mature student at Ruskin College, Oxford, and then at Cambridge, where he was president of the union. He went on to become a BBC producer, but in his mid-40s won the nomination for the safe Labour seat of Stoke-on-Trent South. But for the painful twist in his life which occurred a mere two years later, he might have gone on to ministerial office; he might even have become for a while a Labour social security minister in the Lords. However in 1968, he lost his hearing. In a book called Journey into Silence, he describes how he came round after an unsuccessful operation to hear the noises of trams grinding across the points outside his window. He opened the curtains. There were no trams. This was tinnitus, the fearful affliction which fills the heads of the deaf with meaningless noise. Ashley felt he ought to retire. His local party would not hear of it. MPs on both sides rallied around. Some Conservative ministers, answering his often aggressive questions, mouthed their answers out with a care which enabled him to lip-read. Edward Heath was especially good at it. Sometimes Ashley pitched his voice too high, sometimes too low. A Tory backbencher sitting opposite, Neal Marten, used to put his hands on his head to signal \"too high\", on his knees to signal \"too low\". Elsewhere, his wife Pauline and his three talented daughters helped him to deal with otherwise impossible tasks which come with politics, like taking telephone calls and being interviewed for the Today programme. But it was always wrong to tag Ashley, as people often unthinkingly did, as \"the deaf MP\". He was just an unusually dedicated, diligent and honest MP who, on the side as it were, was deaf. Now he's a peer of just the same kind - except that modern technology has marvellously restored some of his hearing. The reputation of politics in Britain, as across a lot of the world, is woundingly low: right down there with such ne'er-do-wells as estate agents and journalists. Anyone who knows the world well will tell you that is unjust. Politicians, like the rest of us, make up a spectrum from sinners right up to saints. Jack Ashley may lose in the end to the might of a government determined to get its bill, but the fight he has put up this time, like so many others before it, redeems the reputation of politics. Related documentary Lords reform: special report Undoing Britain is nothing new Last weekend the Economist produced a survey entitled Undoing Britain? Its thesis, backed by a MORI poll, was that the constituent parts of the kingdom were drifting further and further apart. Immediately a great trumpeting arose from Conservative politicians and various huffers and puffers in the right-wing press. Their message, being stripped of adornments, was always the same. Told you so. Didn't I say that devolution would set us on the slippery slope which would lead to the break-up of Britain? Well, here is the proof. But it wasn't. Anyone who has followed these matters over the years knows that the trends identified here have been visible since the late 50s. Devolution was not the cause of Scotland and Wales drifting away from England: it was the response. This morning Professor John Curtice of Glasgow skewers the case of the huffers and puffers in a letter to the Telegraph, which had bemoaned the Economist evidence in a leader comment pulsating with blockheaded bigotry. Just two points, says the professor. Polls conducted back in 1986 showed the same pattern as this one. And Mori's sub-samples for Scotland and Wales? It interviewed just 94 people in Scotland, and 40 in Wales.

A higher percentage of men and women employed than ever before. I can report that after two and a half years of this Government, unemployment is now lower than at any time in the last twenty years. This Government has not only delivered the New Deal, but delivered new jobs - 700,000 more since 1997. And the minimum wage and working families tax credit are making work pay. But we need to go further. There are today one million job vacancies waiting to be filled and vacancies are at record levels, not in one region alone, but in every region of the United Kingdom. We need to equip the unemployed with all the skills they need for all the jobs that exist. So I can announce to the House that the New Deal first introduced for the under-25s will be extended to all those over-25 in every part of the country. Options will include : - the offer of a job with a private sector employer; - self employment; - work based retraining; - or college training. Backed up by advice counselling and mentoring. I can also announce today new choices for lone parents to get new skills, go to college and go to work. From now on, lone parents will not only be able to train for jobs while receiving income support, but I can announce that they will also benefit from college-based childcare places for 10,000 more children, making a total of 37,000 in all. All lone parents with children above 3 will receive notice of these new choices. In 1909 Britain created the first Labour Exchange in the world - to link potential employees to vacant jobs. And today, with one million vacancies spread throughout the country, Britain must use the most modern technology to match the jobs without workers to the workers without jobs. We will now create a national jobs phone-line under which, for the first time, in every locality, the employment service will continuously update unemployed men and women about new vacancies suitable for their skills. For every constituency in the country, the Government will provide assistance for Members of Parliament, irrespective of political party, to bring the unemployed and potential employers together. Our reforms since 1997 have cut youth and long term unemployment by half. A return to full employment was once a dream. It is now not only a promise but a possibility. In the next decade if we stay the course of reform it can become one of our country's proudest achievements. And, as we extend opportunities to those who are out of work, we will extend the responsibility to take up the work on offer. The informal or hidden economy is now draining billions of pounds in fraudulent benefit claims and unpaid taxes. This loss of revenues, this incidence of fraud, this waste of resources, cannot be allowed to continue and especially when there are jobs that benefit claimants could take. Lord Grabiner QC, will chair a task force bringing together the Treasury, the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, the Department of Social Security and the Employment Service. He will investigate the scale of the problem and the cost to the taxpayer, recommend a plan of action and set a timetable to crack down on the hidden economy. He will examine ways to move economic activity from illegitimate to legitimate businesses. He will consider increased fines for fraud and new requirements specifically for those suspected of being in the hidden economy - to sign on for benefit not every fortnight, but every single day. I say to the unemployed who can work: we will meet our responsibility to ensure there are job opportunities and the chance to learn new skills. You must now meet your responsibility - to earn a wage. And we are ensuring work pays more than benefits. All our measures for work, taken together, mark a new dividing line. This Government believes that the way to help the unemployed is extending the New Deal not abolishing it. As we pursue our ambitions for growth and jobs, we can and must keep our environmental commitments. Under the Deputy Prime Minister, Britain took the lead in successfully negotiating the Kyoto Agreement. And I am today announcing the results of our consultation with business on the climate change levy. Our original proposal cut carbon environmental pollution by 2010 by 1.5 million tonnes a year. Our consultation has shown that we can cut environmental pollution even further, by 2010 - by a total of over 2 million tonnes a year - and at the same time cut the levy from 1.75 billion pounds to 1 billion pounds. I have decided that renewable energy sources and combined heat and power will be exempt from the levy. The main rate per kilowatt hour will be cut from 0.21 to 0.15 pence. And there will now be an 80 per cent discount to energy intensive sectors signing energy efficiency agreements. Taken together, these changes approach a 90 per cent discount on the levy published at Budget time in return for agreed industry action to cut emissions. All the revenues raised will be recycled to business. I can confirm that every business will receive a tax cut of 0.3 percentage points in employer national insurance contributions. And I have ensured that this package is not only revenue neutral for business and revenue neutral between manufacturing and services but even after the national insurance change there is no gain to the public purse. In the run up to the Budget we will consult on a new 100 per cent first year investment allowance for companies moving from environmentally unfriendly to environmentally friendly technologies and processes. I propose to make available not, as originally announced, 50 million pounds, but in its first year a total of 150 million pounds to support energy efficiency in British industry. With all our measures, Britain is on track to meet our country's Kyoto target. The fuel escalator was inherited from the previous Government. Since 1997 the escalator has been needed to reduce the 28 billion pounds deficit we inherited as we put in place our new measures to protect the environment. Those who have opposed the escalator - including some who originally imposed it - have to explain how, without it, they would have cut the deficit, made money available for public services and in the last two years been meeting our environmental commitments. Having cut the deficit and introduced our new environmental policies, we are now in a position - instead of the pre-announced 6 per cent escalator - to make our decisions Budget by Budget with the following commitment: if there are any real term rises in road fuel duties, they will be lower and the revenues will go straight to a ring-fenced fund for the modernisation of roads and public transport. Now that the return leg exemption of air passenger duty has been declared in breach of single market law I am today starting a Pre-Budget consultation on replacing it with a new lower rate for lower fares. These changes will be revenue neutral. Today I am also implementing recommendations that have come from Martin Taylor to prevent, detect and punish tobacco smuggling. Smuggling is now costing us 2.5 billion pounds a year. The Pre-Budget Report contains details of our decisions - new scanners at major ports to detect contraband goods; new cigarette pack marks; and new and tougher fines and penalties for those who smuggle and those who sell smuggled goods. I turn now to our next ambition - to reduce and then abolish child poverty in Britain. The promise of the next decade and the new century should be not just for some children but for every one of Britain's children. By April, child benefit for the first child will be 15 pounds. By the next April, for the typical family, child benefit and the children's tax credit will be 23 pounds. And with our 10p starting rate of income tax and the cut from 23p to 22p in the basic rate, the tax burden - national insurance as well as income tax - for the average family will be cut to its lowest level for 25 years. Our intention is to integrate the children's tax credit and the child elements of working families tax credit and income support into one single credit paid direct to the mother - built on the foundation of universal child benefit. At today's prices it would mean child payments starting at 15 pounds a week in contrast to 11.05 pounds in 1997 and, for the poorest child, rising to over 40 pounds a week. In our Pre-Budget consultations we will also examine whether through the working families tax credit or other measures we can give more help to the mother who wishes to stay at home in the first months after her child is born. Government must do more, but Government on its own cannot win the war against child poverty. It can only be won by the combined energies of public private and voluntary sectors working together. We need not only cash but caring. So the Pre-Budget Report will consult on new reforms to support the community organisations that are closest to people and where dedicated staff and volunteers can offer one-to-one help. First a new Children's Fund which will provide project grants for community action to tackle all aspects of child poverty. Second, so we can develop new and innovative ways to support families and children, Sure Start will now see resources devolved not just to local Government but to local partnerships led by neighbourhoods and the voluntary sector. Third, for too long the voluntary sector has been held back by outdated tax laws. We propose that in future, for every pound a British citizen donates to charity, the government will contribute to that charity an additional 28 pence. And for every pound contributed through payroll-giving, the Government will contribute not 28 pence but up to 50 pence worth of tax relief. And there will now be tax relief, not just for cash donations to charities, but for gifts of quoted shares. The British people's willingness to give can give all our children a better chance and all of us a better society. From a platform of a stable economy and sustainable finances we are delivering 40 billion pounds extra for health and education. And it is only by continuing our policies for stability and steady growth that we will be able to achieve a further ambition for Britain, to build the best public services. In our second Comprehensive Spending Review, to be completed next year, we will match investment with reform - increasing the amount of resources available for the NHS and education in our public services. I can announce two decisions that can be made now. Through the windfall levy, 5,000 schools throughout Britain have already been modernised. With the addition of a further 150 million pounds, to the four billion pounds already allocated for schools capital, the Secretary of State for Education will be able to treble that figure. By 2001 the number of schools modernised or being modernised will total 15,000, half the schools of Britain, benefiting over 5 million pupils. There is a strong public health case for year-on-year real term increases in the price of cigarettes. While we will now make our decisions Budget by Budget, I can announce a new approach: the extra revenues from a 5 per cent real terms rise in cigarette duties would go straight to additional investment in the National Health Service, worth 300 million pounds a year, 300 million pounds extra for hospitals and health care which could start next April. I have a further announcement to make. From this week the 100 pound winter allowance is being paid to every pensioner household in Britain. The Secretary of State for Social Security will announce later today that the winter allowance will not just be paid this year but next year and every year from now on. For pensioners with incomes above benefit level who are not wealthy, we propose a better deal on savings. The elderly especially will benefit from my proposal to cut the starting rate of tax on savings from 20p to 10p - 1.5 million pensioners will benefit. I have one final announcement. All Governments have agreed that we ought to provide the most help for our most elderly citizens - those over 75 or 80 who are more likely to be in poverty and more likely to have special needs. Some have suggested a new age-related addition to benefits. Some have suggested the way to do this is to provide the very elderly with a reduction in the TV licence fee. I have rejected that option. Instead, from next Autumn, pensioners 75 or over - every pensioner aged 75 or more - will receive their television licence free of charge. At a cost of 300 million pounds a year, every one of the 3 million households with a pensioner over 75 will be able to save 101 pounds a year. Madam Speaker, this Government is demonstrating that enterprise and fairness can go hand in hand. This Government's work for Britain has only just begun and I commend this Report to the House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/09/booksforchildrenandteenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-09T18:22:30Z","webTitle":"Picture perfect","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/09/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/09/booksforchildrenandteenagers","fields":{"headline":"Picture perfect","bodyText":"Far too often, the reward for all that hard work learning to read has been for children to have the pictures knocked out of their books. But at last the continuing role of the illustrator in the lives of young readers is being reflected in some of what publishers are offering. Because of the subdued manner of its first publication, Salman Rushdie's novel Haroun And The Sea Of Stories (Viking, £14.99) didn't reach the readership it deserved. This new edition, lavishly illustrated by Paul Birkbeck, should make amends. Relaxed, inventive, funny and wise, this is the best kind of writing for children from seven and upwards. The power of stories, and our need for them, lies at the heart of the twisting plot, enriched by such delightful ideas as P2C2E - \"problem too complicated to explain\". Christine Fowler, Margaret Bateson-Hill, Gloria Runs Close To Lodge and Philomine Lakota make up the team behind Shota And The Star Quilt (Zero To Ten, £9.99). The first two hail from Lancashire, while the others live on Native American reservations. This vibrantly colourful picture storybook appears in English and Lakota, a language still taught and spoken in the reservations. The contemporary story, ideal for seven- to 10-year olds, tells of the consequences of decisions made by city developers but the solution is traditional, peaceful and powerful. The Egg Thieves by Joan Lingard (Hodder, £3.50) is a deft detective story aimed at seven- to 10-year-olds about the theft of osprey eggs from a protected nest. A small village is beset with suspicion and intrigue as its inhabitants await the inevitable return of the criminals. Paul Howard's illustrations are a delight. Paul Rogers uses page design as an integral part of The Toy Breaker (Bodley, Head £9.99), a contemporary fable about a boy who is unfairly accused of wanton destruction and isolated from his peer group as a result. Jamie's only choice is to find the toy breaker before everybody's Christmas is ruined. For children aged seven to 10. Chris Riddell's superb illustrations are part and parcel of Paul Stewart's excellent fantasy series, The Edge Chronicles. The second, Stormchaser (Doubleday, £10.99), is as action-packed as its predecessor, Beyond The Deepwoods (now available in paperback, Corgi, £4.99). Twig finally fulfils his ambition to explore the sky and so encounters a further extraordinary range of weird, wonderful and alarming characters in his quest to save the perilously balanced city of Sanctaphrax. For nine-year-olds and upwards. Jacqueline Wilson's accessible novels have had a profound effect on her readers. Nick Sharratt's illustrations are an integral part of her success, but in How To Survive Summer Camp (Oxford, £3.99), it is Sue Heap's quirky line drawings which enrich the story, aimed at nine- to 14-year-olds. Dispatched with haste to Evergreen Summer Camp so that her mother can enjoy her honeymoon, Stella is utterly miserable. The story is a skillful combination of comedy, adventure and real life. Roy Kane TV Detective (A&amp;C Black, £3.99) is a pacey mix of technological wizardry and good old detective work. Our chisel-jawed hero sets out to solve a theft and ends up thwarting a murder. Steve Bowkett's story and David Burroughs' strip cartoon illustration ably avoid sending up the genre; the tension is genuine and the plot complex. This is one of the excellent Graffix series, ideal for readers, aged 10 to 12 years, who balk at unadulterated text. Autumn always heralds the arrival of weighty anthologies. The glittery cover of Centuries Of Stories (Harper Collins, £14.99) encases 20 stories, each set in consecutive centuries by an impressive range of authors who appear more liberated than constrained by the structure. It's a splendid collection, and a marvellous showcase for the writers. For children aged nine to 12 years. MacB (Puffin, £3.99) is an intriguing reworking by Neil Arksey of the plot of Macbeth set amidst the complex and intensely hierarchical world of school football. Using sparky dialogue and an excellent cast of characters, Arksey has made excellent use of the original but retains his own narrative control. It's a brave effort and it pays off. For readers aged 10 to 12 years. Don't overlook the stories from Ancient Greece retold in the rather workaday-looking Bright-Eyed Athena (British Museum Press, £6.99). Evoking the tradition of storytelling over the spinning wheel, this is a captivating collection about that awesome and unpredictable goddess. The Barefoot Book of Giants, Ghosts And Goblins (Barefoot Books, £12.99), retold by John Matthews and charmingly illustrated by Giovanni Manna, draws on stories from all over the world. Peopled with a wonderful array of characters, this collection for ages seven-plus has wit and wisdom in abundance. In Dolphin Boy (Mammoth, £3.99) Julie Bertagna writes simply about the complex relationship between an autistic boy and his sister. On the one hand she adores him but, on the other, she resents the stranglehold he has over the family. This is controlled and elegant writing, aimed at nine- to 12-year-olds, about how a dolphin loosens that grip. David Clement Davies' first novel, Fire Bringer (Macmillan, £12.99), is a compelling animal fantasy set in the Scottish Highlands at the start of the millennium. Animal stories for the nine to 14 age group need to suspend disbelief from the outset and the author's confident description establishes a credible premise from the outset. One superb exponent of the animal fantasy genre is Brian Jacques, whose 12th novel in the Redwall series, The Legend Of Luke (Hutchinson, £12.99), delves ever deeper into the extraordinary woodland world now so familiar to his readers. The opening, with a chirpy hedgehog pole-vaulting over a stream, is classic Jacques. He is a wonderful storyteller, immersed in his kingdom. For eight- to 15-year-olds. Elizabeth Laird has embarked on a series of excellent books all set in Africa - Wild Things. In Leopard Trail (Macmillan, £2.99) Tom is captivated by the sights and sounds of this apparently idyllic country but soon finds himself caught up in a dangerous plot to save a leopard. This is sure-footed, intelligent writing for eight- to 12-year-olds who enjoy reading adventures with substance. Michael Morpurgo's selection for his anthology, Animal Stories (Kingfisher, £5.99), is a fascinating one. It leads readers into an eclectic variety of cultures and genres and includes extracts from the writing of Janet Frame, Ted Hughes, Charles Darwin, Beryl Markham and the book of Genesis. For nine years upwards. John Gordon's books deserve much wider readership and recognition. In The Midwinter Watch (Walker, £3.99) he sets a multilayered time-slip mystery, creating a tense thriller around a timepiece stolen a century before. Ideal for 10-to-14s. The Kin, Peter Dickinson's impressive epic set two millennia ago in Africa has been divided into four: Suth's Story, Noli's Story, Ko's Story and Mana's Story (Macmillan, £3.99 each). Dickinson has ploughed a lonely, innovative furrow as a writer for young people but with this wonderful book he should surely find a long overdue audience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/nov/10/saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-10T01:36:55Z","webTitle":"Progress as Saudi women get ID cards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/10/saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/nov/10/saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Progress as Saudi women get ID cards","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most conservative countries, has taken a small but significant step forward for women by agreeing to issue them with their own identity cards. Prince Ahmad, the country's deputy interior minister, told Jeddah's English-language newspaper the Arab News that identity cards for women would be issued as soon as preparations were completed. \"Women in Saudi Arabia,\" he said, \"just like men, have their rights in all areas... and they have the right to carry their own identity cards and to enjoy their legitimate rights.\" As things stand, women are listed on the identity cards of a male next-of-kin, usually their husband or father. One of the objections of the more conservative camp fiercely opposed to the identity cards is that the bearer's photograph would appear on the cards. But women who travel abroad have no difficulty acquiring passports. Wives and daughters often carry photocopies of their male relative's card, but can encounter problems. \"If there is no picture on it,\" said a young woman in Jeddah who wished to remain anonymous, \"how on earth can the bank teller be sure that I am the person I say I am.\" Any change of this kind disturbs the traditionalists, and especially the powerful and often deeply reactionary religious hierarchy. Leading clerics protested vehemently earlier this year when Crown Prince Abdullah, the reform-minded de facto ruler, declared that women were a basic part of society whose \"active role\" no one, \"whoever they are\", would be permitted to \"undermine or marginalise\". Among the liberals, there are those who say that, while the new measure may not add up to very much in itself, it is an important step in the right direction. \"It will lead to more,\" said Khalid Maeena, editor of Arab News, \"even, who knows, to women driving.\" Others give scant credit to the regime for a measure that was long overdue. They point out that even in tiny neighbouring Qatar, women can drive and vote in elections. \"First of all,\" said the young woman in Jeddah, \"it is a matter of dignity and self-respect for us. What do you think we feel like, going to the bank and getting turned away because we cannot prove our identity? I'm not a militant, I just want to live a normal life. \"Perhaps it [the identity card] will help, but not much.\" The introduction of the cards - if followed by other steps - could facilitate the conduct of business. That, say observers, is one of the reasons for the new measure. With the oil-rich kingdom facing serious socio-economic problems, among them high unemployment, Prince Abdullah is trying to push through far-reaching reforms. Although Saudi women are more highly educated than men, only about 5% of them work. They could make a far greater contribution to the economy if they were not frustrated by so much discrimination against them. One businessman said: \"We have to send a male relative to deal with government officials, other businesses, or invest on the local stock exchange.\" While many hope that the new identity cards could lead to women being free to travel without their husband's or father's permission, others are still sceptical. \"You're dreaming,\" said the Jeddah woman, \"I can't even go to Riyadh without my husband's permission, let alone London. And whatever [interior minister] Prince Nayif says about women driving, I shall believe it when I see it. \"How dare he say that this is not a vital issue for the time being and here we are about to join the World Trade Organisation.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/10/booksforchildrenandteenagers.philippullman","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-10T18:22:29Z","webTitle":"Teenages kicks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/10/booksforchildrenandteenagers.philippullman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/10/booksforchildrenandteenagers.philippullman","fields":{"headline":"Teenages kicks","bodyText":"Time-slips, marooned Japanese soldiers and digging holes - Philip Pullman finds plenty to interest adolescent readers Teenage books this autumn show a wide variety of subject matter; if a theme does emerge, it does so tentatively. But the odd one out is something that several writers are engaging with. Jacqueline Wilson's The Illustrated Mum (Doubleday, £10.99) has been widely praised, and justly so. Marigold is a tattooed, fey, selfish and troubled mother, whose daughters Star and Dolphin - their names give away the New Age fatuity Marigold is in thrall to - have to cope when she can't. And Marigold is becoming genuinely ill. Wilson is doing something important and rare. Not content to stand still, she's widening and deepening the scope of her work while maintaining its central hold on her readers. She's so good, it's exhilarating. I was delighted, too, with two books that deal in very different ways with the matter of being a teenage girl. Louise Rennison's Angus, Thongs And Full-Frontal Snogging (Piccadilly, £5.99) is as funny as the blurb says it is, with the sort of inventiveness and charm rarely seen in the now somewhat tired diary form. Rachel Anderson's Bloom Of Youth (Hodder Signature, £4.99) is also funny, with a melancholy edge, and the advantage of an underexplored setting: the 50s rural bohemian-shabby-genteel. Sweet teenage Ruth, who tells the story, is living on the cusp of the modern world, and her discontent is partly due to the fact that rock'n'roll is not yet quite audible over the sound of the Syd Butler Dance Orchestra. But there are two more books in the series to come. I shall read them avidly. Stanley, the hero of Louis Sachar's Holes (Bloomsbury, £10.99), is an outsider in many senses. He's been sent to Camp Green Lake, where they believe that \"if you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy\". Stanley is innocent, but of course that makes no difference. Holes won the Newbery Award in the United States, and I can see why: the plain uninflected telling has the quality of a fable, the bright clarity of the narrative being shadowed by an atmosphere hard to define but unmistakably powerful. Buried treasure and brutality, courage and coincidence are the elements of this accomplished novel. David Almond's Kit's Wilderness (Hodder Signature, £4.99) has some of the atmosphere of his Carnegie Medal-winning Skellig. The plot involves a long-ago mining disaster and the brooding, teenage Askew, whose obsessive game of death involves his friend Kit and the theatrical Allie in a dangerous exploration of ancient dark places. This book shares a sort of untidiness in common with Skellig - as if the parts aren't fully integrated: the girl who wants to act has a fizzy kind of presence that carries with it the atmosphere of a different story altogether, and the symbolism of dark and light is too obviously signalled. But Almond has a genuine and stubborn talent. So has Michael Morpurgo. He writes with such consistency and productivity that it's easy to take the high quality for granted. Kensuke's Kingdom (Heinemann, £8.99) tells of a round-the-world voyage that goes wrong. Young Michael, having fallen overboard from his family's yacht in a typhoon, is washed up on a Pacific island where he finds himself, disconcertingly, not alone. His relationship with the old Japanese soldier left behind after the war is delicately and truthfully developed, and the pages turn by themselves. Japan and the second world war feature also in Garry Disher's The Divine Wind (Hodder Signature, £4.99). Hartley's father owns half a dozen pearling boats in the little Western Australian town of Broome, and Hartley falls in love with the daughter of one of his Japanese divers. But the war is coming closer, and with it problems. The atmosphere of pre-war Australia is superbly evoked - the combination of free-and-easy mateship and prim, narrow suspicion of the alien is especially striking. The portrait of the racist magistrate who talks of \"breeding a superior Australian type\" is chilling, and the story unfolds in a muted tragedy. Susan Cooper plays an original variation on the old time-slip theme in King Of Shadows (Bodley Head, £10.99). Young Nat Field is one of The Company Of Boys, an American theatre group dedicated to playing Shakespeare. During a London tour in which they are going to present A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Globe Theatre, Nat falls ill and finds himself in Shakespeare's own company in 1599, rehearsing the same play. Twenty or so years ago, when every other novel was a time-slip, the change of scene itself would have been the story; but Cooper is too subtle for that. Nat, whose history is full of pain, needs to meet Shakespeare, and, for a strikingly clever reason, Shakespeare needs to meet him. Both backgrounds are full of authentic detail, and the emotional resonance is clear and true. There is a good and varied collection of shorter pieces, both short stories and extracts from longer works, in Betsy Byars' Classic Teen Stories (Kingfisher, £5.99). Byars has ranged a long way. Philippa Pearce, Robert Cormier, and Roald Dahl find themselves well matched by Graham Greene, VS Pritchett and William Saroyan. But the book that impressed me most this year, both for the scope of its ambition and the elegance of its accomplishment, was Jan Mark's The Eclipse Of The Century (Scholastic, £14.99). It's a long time since I read anything so powerfully original. After a near-death experience, a young man sets off for the central Asian post-Soviet city of Qantoum, and sets in train a series of events involving millennial fears and expectations, tribal passions, and some of the most extraordinary animals in fiction. This is a book to which no short review can do justice. I'll merely say that if it doesn't win a major prize, something is badly wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/1999/nov/11/onlinesupplement7","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-11T01:21:09Z","webTitle":"Games watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/nov/11/onlinesupplement7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/1999/nov/11/onlinesupplement7","fields":{"headline":"Games watch","bodyText":"Under pressure The success of the Sega Dreamcast has put Nintendo's N64 under pressure in the UK: it doesn't have the speed or advanced graphics of the Dreamcast, nor the huge range of games available for the Sony PlayStation, and buyers will usually go for one or the other. Nintendo's response has been to cut the price of the standalone N64 to £64.99, to try to pick of sales from those who might buy the cheapest console available. This has the odd result that the N64 is now cheaper than the smaller and much less sophisticated Game Boy Color handheld console, which presumably is cheaper to make. The N64 is also available in translucent coloured versions for £74.99 and with various games such as Goldeneye (£84.98). Donkey Kong 64 (£59.99) is due on December 3, and that will be bundled with a console for £109.98. However, it would seem Nintendo needs to launch its own next generation machine, code-named Dolphin, sooner rather than later. Biggs bagged SCi's motoring mayhem game Carmageddon upset a few people, and the company will probably upset a few more with a game now under development: The Great Train Robbery. Two of the people involved in the 1963 affair, Ronnie Biggs and Bruce Reynolds, will work as design consultants on the project. It doesn't sound a very interesting scenario for a game, but if it's attacked in the tabloids and denounced in parliament, the publicity wouldn't do sales any harm. Build and ride Theme Park was a huge hit for Surrey-based games developer Bullfrog, while Sim City was a huge hit for California's Maxis. Both were taken over by Electronic Arts, and the result is SimTheme Park, which has just been released for Microsoft Windows 95/98 in the US, and should reach the UK next year. The basic idea doesn't seem to have changed - build fairground rides and run a theme park - but the graphics are better, and there are more rides. In fact, there are now four different themes for theme park rides: Space Zone, The Lost Kingdom, Land of Wonders and Halloween. It's a Bullfrog game and it's not clear what the Sim adds, if anything, but it's a good marketing ploy. Meanwhile, Elixir Studios founder Demis Hassabis, who worked on Theme Park while at Bullfrog, has been previewing his forthcoming game, Republic: The Revolution. You play a small-time political leader, and your task is to oust the president of an Eastern Bloc state, Novistrana. Game Boy PIM It's been tried before, but this time it might work: Datel has just launched SmartCom, a personal information manager for the Game Boy. It comes on a standard cartridge, and includes a word processor (compatible with Game Boy printer), an appointments calendar (with alarm), and a mobile phone autodialler. But perhaps the most interesting feature is Game Boy-to-Game Boy messaging, which uses the handheld's built in infra-red communications. The lack of a keyboard and/or a touch-sensitive screen and/or a PC docking station are drawbacks compared with rival devices, including the cartridge-based Palm-compatible Handspring, but the Game Boy plays a far better game of Tetris."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/1999/nov/12/euro2000.sport1","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-12T11:05:01Z","webTitle":"More than a game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/nov/12/euro2000.sport1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/nov/12/euro2000.sport1","fields":{"headline":"More than a game","bodyText":"It was the tie the authorities didn't want. When those names came out of the hat, the first reaction - which dared not speak its name - was \"potential bloodbath\" (God, what about our World Cup bid?). The second would have been \"political ramifications damaging to the Union\". Scotland v England has always been much more than just a football match, particularly north of the border. In fact, probably the least interesting thing about this contest is the actual game itself, between an average England side and a poor Scottish one. For the Scots, a lot of suppressed nationalism was traditionally vented in football. I don't think it's pure coincidence that since the traditional end-of-season match between the two teams was dropped 10 years ago, the Scottish National Party has grown exponentially as a political force, while the unionist party (Conservative) has declined. Scotland now has a more real, mature and political nationalism. Where this leaves the traditional Scottish emotion surrounding this fixture remains to be seen. When the draw was made, a lot of friends in London were asking me if I thought that it would \"go off\" between the rival \"hooligan\" mobs of the countries. I didn't think it would. No self-respecting Scottish hooligan would open the curtains to watch the national team play, whereas any England thug worth his salt will want to be there. The strange thing is that this is a complete reversal of the situation in the 70s. Then the Scotland v England fixture was the one occasion that united the more aggressive factions of the Rangers and Celtic support, who would cast aside their differences for one day every two years to run riot through the streets of London. Back then, no English hooligan took much interest in the fixture. It was considered a bit strange in those days to support the England national team, the preserve of specky anorak types. Chelsea and West Ham changed all that when their boys took to following England away, making up the bulk of the travelling support. Both teams were in the doldrums throughout the 80s, and thus the national team provided a focus for them - and an opportunity to export hooliganism to Europe. In Scotland, the reverse has been the case. Football's violence has all but vanished from the culture of the Scottish national support, which has traditionally been Glasgow dominated. Most football-minded Scots outside Glasgow are alienated by the bias of the footballing authorities and the Scottish media towards Rangers and Celtic. This bias manifests itself everywhere, in terms of which players get selected for the national team, how much coverage the Glasgow clubs receive in the media, right down to the location of the national stadium. While national attention was firmly focused on Glasgow, the irony was that Rangers and Celtic fans were taking less interest in the Scottish national team than ever. The main reason for that was that the Scottish side had declined drastically in a world context. The skilled, glorious failures of yesteryear were at least contenders; the dour minnows that replaced them make 90 minutes browsing through an Argos catalogue seem appealing. But the Old Firm disaffection was magnified by a peculiar manifestation of Scottish bigotry. Through the 70s and 80s the Troubles in Northern Ireland were receiving more and more attention. This brought about the institutionalisation and ritualisation of the traditional bigotry of the Glasgow supporter, who has always taken an unhealthy interest in such things. The bigot had an opportunity to disguise daft prejudices as some sort of principled political stance. So for Celtic fans, the logical conclusion to being a \"true Tim\" was to follow not Scotland, but the Republic of Ireland. Also at this time, Republic of Ireland internationals such as Pat Bonner, Chris Morris, Mick McCarthy and Tony Cascarino were playing for Celtic. The cultural and commercial rise of the replica strip welded the connection. Television cameras began to capture a visible Celtic presence at Ireland games. Rangers Billy-boy bigots had more of a problem. They couldn't really appropriate \"Scotland\" as a concept that excluded Catholics as they had been able to do in the past. Being \"pro-Scotland\" in the changing political climate of 80s English Tory rule was increasingly perceived as a pro-nationalist stance. And it's hard to be a nationalist in Scotland and a unionist in Northern Ireland. Also, when Graeme Souness was appointed manager in 1986 and brought with him a clutch of top English players, Rangers became more of a United Kingdom concern than ever. So while Celtic fans flew the Irish tricolour and supported the Republic, Rangers fans waved the Union Jack and thought of the teddy bears embodying Scotland as the Protestant bastion of unionist Britain. Meanwhile, the \"Tartan army\", the followers of the Scotland national team, became more middle-class than ever largely due to the Scottish Football Association's control of tickets which were sold through its travel club. Whenever tickets are strictly controlled and tied to travel packages (and so made more expensive) you invariably get the replacement of traditional working-class supporters by the nouveau riche. Many followers of the Scotland team now are not so much football supporters as professional celebrators. If they do go regularly to club matches, they tend to follow the smaller clubs or junior football. The atmosphere is boisterous but friendly, with fans over anxious to behave well in order to show their alleged differences from the \"hooligan\" English. Even given the hateful atmosphere of this fixture, it's difficult to envisage serious numbers of Hibernian, Aberdeen, Rangers or Motherwell \"hooligans\" fighting side by side against anyone. The smaller number of clubs with significant mobs in Scotland and the fact that the Scottish Premier League teams meet each other four times a year makes the participants more easily identifiable, the aggro more personal and forced unity for an international fixture a lot harder to achieve. It also makes the whole scene easier to police and the Scottish forces have been far more successful than their English counterparts in controlling what is still strangely referred to as \"football hooliganism\". This doesn't mean that there won't be trouble; far from it. You can be sure that there will be an England mob \"up for it\", mostly without tickets, at both Hampden and Wembley. There will also be numerous instances of isolated violence against both English and Scots supporters before, after and during both games. There will be a massive police presence and the matches will be played in an atmosphere of poisonous hate, which will carry on for at least a week, in public houses all over the disunited kingdom. It'll make us remember why we let the fixture lapse in the first place. These are interesting times for our islands. Scotland is taking its faltering steps towards growing up. But it's done this by dumping the constitutional burden - and the democratic deficit - on to England. The potential for animosity is probably just as great as ever. The big challenge now for England is to carve out its own post-imperial identity, The task for Scotland is to keep growing up and do it quickly - the game against England shouldn't mean as much to us as it does. And it still does, however we try to talk it down. On the day of either match I know that simply because of their accents, I won't be able to bring myself to be around some of my closest friends. I wouldn't trust myself and I probably wouldn't trust some of them either. And that makes me feel sad. The problem with occasions like this is that they tell us things about ourselves that we'd sometimes rather not know. To that end, I think the biggest test will lie with the media on both sides of the border. Extreme sensitivity will be needed - certainly a lot more than I've seen in some Scottish tabloids of late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/12/uk.millennium","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-12T17:32:46Z","webTitle":"End of century snapshot of nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/12/uk.millennium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/12/uk.millennium","fields":{"headline":"End of century snapshot of nation","bodyText":"It is the ultimate snapshot of the state of the nation at the end of the 20th century, and it shows that Britons are living longer, becoming richer and even enjoying better weather. Britain 2000, the official yearbook of the United Kingdom, published by the office of national statistics, details every aspect of British life from the broad brush of government policy to the number of listed garden sheds, pigsties and lavatories. The book was devised 51 years ago as a handy reference guide for British diplomats abroad, and every year 10,000 copies are bought by the foreign and commonwealth office and sent to the nation's outposts abroad to be given away to foreign officials and dignitaries. But this year the handbook has been published early in the hope that the general public, caught in a millennium frenzy, will buy Britain 2000 in their hordes as a lasting record of the final year of the century. John King, the editor of the book, which retails for £37.50, said the millennium was a defining moment. \"This yearbook will be used this time round as a source book for those who want to know what happened at the beginning of the century,\" he said. In a break from the norm, the statisticians who have compiled the handbook have also dredged through records from the turn of the century to compare life today with Britain 100 years ago. The most dramatic change they have identified is that the nation is in the midst of a serious ageing problem. In 1901 the average man lived to 45 while women could expect to last until the ripe old age of 49. Ten decades later and the figures have shot up to 74 and 79 respectively, with the proportion of the population aged 50 and over nearly doubling from one in six in 1901 to about one in three by 1998. Gordon Brown's pledge to give free television licences to the over 75s could be a lot more expensive over the next two decades than the chancellor might have imagined. There has been a big increase in the number of people living into their 80s and beyond, with projections indicating this group will make up 5% of the population by 2021. At the other end of the spectrum the number of people under 16 has been falling to such an extent that by 2021 there will be more people aged 65 and over than children under 16. The armed forces have also changed dramatically in character since Britain was at the peak of its imperial power. In 1900 the Royal Navy had 112,000 officers and seamen, a number that has been reduced to 43,700 in the intervening years. Meanwhile the army, which totalled 726,000 men here and abroad in 1900, was less concerned with recruiting young offenders as it was about purchasing the 470,000 horses and 150,000 mules and donkeys needed for the Boer war. Not surprisingly the economy has also seen wholesale changes. At the turn of the century Britain was principally a manufacturing nation, with almost a million people working in the mines and the same number employed in the textile trade. Now there are only 15,000 mineworkers and 160,000 textile workers, while only a quarter of national wealth is generated by manufacturing. The book even points to evidence of climate change. During the winter of 1899-1900 workers spent more than 55,000 hours removing snow from the streets of Wandsworth alone. In recent years snow has rarely settled for long enough in central London to warrant removal. Britain's vital statistics • Just over 6% of the population describe themselves as belonging to a non-white ethnic group. • The top free tourist attraction in 1998 was Blackpool Pleasure Beach with 3m visitors. • Some 43,000 people fall from ladders each year, while another 500 burn themselves on barbecues. • Among sites listed by the government as being of historical importance are 52 garden sheds, 499 pigsties, and 277 lavatories. • In the past year, the rarest frog in the UK, the European pool frog, has been found in a suburban garden; the glutinous snail, thought extinct, has turned up in north Wales; and the rare allis shad has been caught in the river Tamar, 121 years after it was last recorded. • Emissions of carbon dioxide from transport have doubled in the past 30 years, while industrial emissions have halved. • The average income has doubled in real terms between 1971 and 1997."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/13/books.guardianreview3","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-13T02:17:33Z","webTitle":"But we never did stand quite alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/13/books.guardianreview3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/13/books.guardianreview3","fields":{"headline":"But we never did stand quite alone","bodyText":"Remembrance Day prompts historical reflections; the debate about Britain's future is conducted in terms of the past. Competing political strategies are justified by conflicting visions of history. Some visions are disarmingly simple. Lord Rees-Mogg, a leading Europhobe, complained that the prime minister understands little of history: \"Again and again, the issue of national independence has arisen. We were conquered by the Romans; we were conquered by the Anglo-Saxons; we would, but for King Alfred, have been conquered by the Danes; we were conquered by the Normans. But we were not conquered by Philip II of Spain, by Louis XIV, by Napoleon, by Kaiser Wilhelm or by Hitler. This has been a consistent aspect of our culture.\" One standard characteristic of nationalist thought is the reduction of history to a flat confrontation between \"Us\" and \"Them\". No one beyond our plucky selves and the dastardly foreigners exists. A picture is presented where the whole of history becomes a series of dress rehearsals for the big match of 1940. We lost some; and we won some; but we never surrendered the spirit of independence bequeathed to us by Caractacus and Boudicca. Yes, 1940 did see a magnificent act of defiance: and Churchill's speeches, when \"we stood alone\", do evoke justified pride. Yet one must not lose a sense of proportion. \"We\", the population of the United Kingdom, did not exactly stand alone. We had an Empire; we had Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans to help us; and we had Continental allies. The RAF could hardly have coped on its own. During the Battle of Britain, the margin of superiority was wafer thin. It would not have happened without the sacrifice of the Polish squadrons who helped defend London but whose contribution is now largely forgotten. (The insignia of those squadrons had to be etched onto the Battle of Britain Memorial as an afterthought.) How many readers have heard that the pilot who shot down the largest number of Luftwaffe raiders in 1940 was a Czech? The nationalist vision of history is selfish and self-centred. It finds little room for phrases such as \"common endeavour\" or \"interdependence\". In the British case, it consistently gives the impression that \"We\" won all our wars single-handed. It overlooks a cardinal fact that the British army, like the English army before it, was never strong enough to confront the major European powers on equal terms. Throughout modern history, His or Her Majesty's government policy was always to put the lion's share of resources into the Royal Navy. So the army could only take the field in European campaigns as a junior partner of allied coalitions. At Blenheim, only one sixth of the troops at Marlborough's disposal were English. At Waterloo, less than a quarter of the Allied force was British. In the first world war, British forces made up one fifth of the Allied total. In the second world war, 75% of all German casu alties were inflicted by the Soviet Army, while the British contribution was necessarily much smaller than that of the Americans. These elementary statements merely underline Britain's limited military capacity, further reduced since the downgrading of sea-power. As for the love affair with independence, one should be wary: one nation's independence has often meant another's servitude. Ireland lost her independence in stages from the 12th century onwards, thanks to successive English conquests. She regained it, but only in part, in 1922. Wales lost her independence to the English in medieval times, and was forcibly incorporated into England in 1536. Both the English and the Scots lost their independence when they agreed in 1707 to enter the British superstate, which in due course did its best to deny independence to the Americans. The Moggites do not realise that \"the British people\" were a product of modern times not a tribe from the Garden of Eden. One may pine for the halcyon days when the Navy and the Empire guaranteed British independence. But now, no post-imperial, middle-sized power can afford to dream of absolute sovereignty. All we can seek is the most congenial form of mutual independence with our friends and neighbours. In this context, the old nationalistic interpretations of history are not merely wrong-headed. They are harmful. For the past 40 years, British history has fallen into the hands of specialists who worry about everything, except the general framework of their subject. Not until 1992 did Linda Colley write her ground-breaking book Britons, supplying the materials and the arguments which showed that \"Britishness\" was a modern phenomenon, built on unsavoury prejudices, notably xenophobia and anti-Catholicism. Not until the mid-1990s did presidential addresses to the Royal Historical Society by Professor Rees Davies bring the multiple and evolving identities of the peoples of the British Isles to the top of the academic agenda. The re-configuration of British history is a prime priority. . Many difficulties derive from an almost impenetrable terminological morass. The Oxford English Dictionary still equates the British state with Great Britain, even though the Kingdom of Great Britain ceased to exist in 1800. The Oxford History of Britain talks of Great Britain as \"two polycultural islands\", equally wrong. Almost all libraries treat \"British history\" and \"English history\" as the same thing, which they patently are not. Until the 1970s, almost all historians wrote what they called \"The History of England\". \"England\" was taken to stand not only for England and for the various incarnations of the UK, but also for the Empire. It reinforced the arrogant view that England alone counted. It was not until the Empire evaporated that \"English history\" was renamed \"British history\". Yet little changed even then. Anglo-centric histories, dealing with nothing but England, were simply renamed Histories of Britain. Welsh history stayed behind Welsh walls, Scottish history was revived behind Scottish walls. Insularity of mind is an old enemy. Ever since the days of Thomas Cromwell, generations of English Protestants were taught to believe on pain of treason that the history of their country had little in common with that of Continental Europe. And the habit stuck, even when Protestantism has ceased to dominate.History as a coherent subject in schools began to disintegrate in the same decade that the UK entered the European Community. The old imperial outlook was never replaced by European concerns. Most surveys begin with Julius Caesar. The Celts have been airbrushed from the scene, and their descendants are treated little better. Most damaging is the myth of seamless historical continuity. Mrs Thatcher loved to talk of \"A Thousand Years of British History\". Lord Tebbit once boasted of \"A Thousand Years of British parliamentary history.\" Most Scots are well aware that the state in which we live was brought into being on May 1, 1707 . The Irish are well informed about their complicated relationships with the rest of the Isles. But the English seem unaware that anything fundamental has changed since 1066. Thanks to Shakespeare, they even think that England is an island: \"this sceptr'd isle\". They will be shocked to learn that the UK lost a greater percentage of its territory after the first world war than Germany did. They will be still more bemused by the contention that the disintegration of the UK is proceeding apace. Processes of integration and disintegration which are the everyday matter of the history of other states are not thought to apply to \"Us\". Some people have long argued that Remembrance Day should be allowed to fade. I think that it should continue. I was a child of a generation whose parents had lost their fathers, brothers and boyfriends on the Western Front. I can still hear my mother singing Roses of Picardy : her brother died on November 11, 1918. But I believe that the framework of Remembrance Day should be updated. It should no longer be a purely British occasion but a day for remembering and celebrating our interdependence. We should bring in Canadians, the Anzacs, the Americans and the Commonwealth. And we should find ways to involve representatives of democratic Germany, democratic Italy, and democratic Japan: representatives from Russia and from the countries of central and eastern Europe, who bore the brunt of the last war: and representatives from all our partners in the EU, and in NATO. Remembering our losses in isolation has little point, remembering together is the best way to foster a spirit of common resolve. • Norman Davies's latest book, The Isles: A History, is published by Macmillan (£30).

Britain's most senior Roman Catholic clergyman is a man noted for nothing so much as his conservatism. But some carefully calculated remarks, detailing how the British constitution is an insult to Catholics, have brought the cardinal to the fore of a most unlikely radical alliance. A couple of weeks ago, the leader of Scotland's Catholics gave his first formal address to the nation's new parliament. His prayers in the chamber were graciously and respectfully received. Outside, however, Cardinal Winning announced he was not happy with the British constitution. The act of settlement, he said, was \"a continuing insult to the Roman Catholic community\". Leader writers opined on the unfairness of the 1701 act (an act, that is, of a London parliament which Scottish members had yet to join) which prevents a Roman Catholic from becoming head of state and prohibits the monarch from marrying a member of that faith. The words from Downing Street were conciliatory, but their emphasis was clear: there were no plans to repeal the act. After all, only a few weeks before Tony Blair had told a Tory MSP that attempts to reform the act would be \"complex in the extreme\". But a few days later, the Scottish secretary John Reid, found himself on the BBC's Question Time. Unremarkably but skilfully, he peddled the government line on the standard issues of the day. Then someone asked him about the act of settlement. For a politician of Dr Reid's standing and experience, the response was pretty poor. Dr Reid, a Catholic himself, appeared shocked at the hard time he received: rumour has it he took his woes back to the prime minister. By the following Monday politicians, ever vigilant for a weak spot, were going for the jugular. Two Tory peers - the former solicitor general and lord advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, and the former Scottish secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean - said they planned to present a bill in the new session. In the Commons, Scottish National party MP Roseanna Cunningham laid a motion calling for the act to be repealed. Dr Reid responded by hinting there was room for a U-turn... The act was passed in the dying days of the reign of William III (William of Orange had succeeded in 1689 jointly with Mary II, Protestant daughter of exiled James II). It bars anyone who \"shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a Papist\" from succeeding to the throne. It established the Church of England as the state church, with the reigning monarch as its head. The idea behind it was to exclude the Roman Catholic descendants of James II and secure succession of the English crown to members of the Protestant House of Hanover, unless Queen Anne, last of the Protestant Stuarts, provided an heir. Ironically, the act was passed largely out of fear of the rebellious Jacobites: the very Scottish Roman Catholics who are now heading calls for its abolition. Indeed the Scottish parliament of the day rejected it and the Hanoverians, but did insist on a Protestant succession. For a government prepared to reform the Lords, abolishing the act of settlement should, in theory, be easy business to dispatch. Legal hurdles amount to only three. First, repealing the act would involve looking at not just the act itself, but at least eight more statutes. Although some of these are purely English acts, from before the union of the crowns, and others refer to the United Kingdom, the complexities here are hardly insurmountable. Second, the government would almost certainly have to seek the approval of the other members of the Commonwealth, where the British monarch is also head of state. Again, it is unlikely this would stand in any determined government's way. The third hurdle is far higher: as well as being head of state, the monarch is also head of the Church of England. While there is unlikely to be any significant opposition from the church to the monarch marrying a Catholic, repealing the act would throw up the possibility of the monarch being a Catholic - an altogether thornier prospect. It is a delicate and untested area but, ecclesiastically, the Church of England could probably live with a Roman Catholic as its supreme governor. Theologically, it is highly unlikely that it could. A Roman Catholic head of state would almost certainly mean the disestablishment of the church. No government is willingly going to enter such a minefield and it is this fact of political inertia above all else which may save the anachronistic act. There would, of course, be other legal challenges. Ian Paisley claims the Queen has sworn a coronation oath she cannot deny. Yet if a bill was passed by both houses she would have to sign it - if she did not the monarchy would surely crumble. There is also precedent: the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in the 19th century went against Queen Victoria's coronation oath. Ultimately, any legal challenges are destined to fail: beneath the arcane language of the British constitution is a modern set-up struggling to get out. In almost 300 years, only the European Union has ever stopped parliament from doing as it wishes. It is unlikely to be any different here. That leaves only politics: the view from Ulster would be disparaging; the church would kick up a fuss; legislation would take up considerable parliamentary time. But in Scotland, a country struggling to move away from its sectarian and anti-Roman Catholic past, there is already a groundswell of opinion for change. The question is: will it spread southward? Cardinal Winning refuses to comment: he says the matter is now too political. But the crafty cardinal is well aware that now he has lit the touch paper there will be plenty of others wanting to provide the gunpowder. The constitutional bang should be worth watching. • Gerard Seenan is the Guardian's Scotland correspondent Milestones • 1536: act of union joins Wales to England • 1603: Stuart king of Scotland (James VI) becomes king of England • 1701: act of settlement • 1707: act of union: Scottish parliament dissolves itself • 1800: act of union abolishes Irish parliament • 1920-48: Irish acts establish Irish Free State, later republic and Northern Ireland • 1998: Scotland and Wales acts establish Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/nov/15/monarchy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-15T12:59:50Z","webTitle":"A new republic: Excerpt from Jonathan Freedland's Bring Home the Revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/15/monarchy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/nov/15/monarchy","fields":{"headline":"A new republic: Excerpt from Jonathan Freedland's Bring Home the Revolution","bodyText":"In his acclaimed book, Freedland sets out how Britain can live its own revolution - the one it gave to America The crown is at the heart of Britain's problems with sovereignty, democracy and equality. To the first Americans it was obvious: in a democracy there could be no place for heredity. It was the people who were sovereign, not one social caste. The notion that power could be conferred by blood alone struck them as absurd, and they were determined to be rid of it. In the new republic, there would be no royal dynasty and no formal role for an aristocratic elite. Heredity violated the fundamental American notion of equality which held that any citizen could reach the top, regardless of their genes. As Thomas Paine argued in The Rights of Man, it was people of talent, not high birth, who should lead the country. For Paine, a hereditary governing class was 'as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wiseman, and as ridiculous as an hereditary poet laureate'. He lambasted the British system, which reserved both the throne and the upper house for persons selected by bloodline. That was more than two centuries ago. Yet on the brink of the third millennium, the very same system was still standing. Two-thirds of the 'triple cord which no man can break', as Edmund Burke described the holy trinity of crown, nobility and Commons, were still determined by nothing more than vagaries of paternity. Traditionalists insist that today's monarchy enjoys merely ceremonial and symbolic power, that reformers are wasting their time attacking harmless pageantry. Such a view is either ignorant or disingenuous. Although she arrives at parliament in a gold coach wearing a storybook crown, the Queen is not just a bauble. She has both power and significance. Only electoral fluke has prevented the situation in which the monarch would have to exercise that power: a hung parliament. Faced with deadlock at the polls, the unelected Elizabeth Windsor would decide herself which party leader should be allowed first shot at forming a new government. If Her Majesty decided no administration could be assembled, she would have the authority to call fresh elections. This is more than symbolic influence, yet it exists with not so much as a nod to democracy. How would the Queen make up her mind? Who are the courtiers who would offer Her Majesty 'advice'? Who chose them? It sounds like paranoid Francis Urquhart territory, but this is not fiction. As recently as 1931, the King handpicked a prime minister during a time of political and financial crisis. (In the words of Harold Laski, '[Ramsay] MacDonald was as much the personal choice of George V as Lord Bute was the personal choice of George III.' MacDonald's emergence at the head of the National Government was 'a Palace Revolution'.) According to the veteran student of Whitehall, Peter Hennessey, the Queen has had at least five similar moments of decision since 1949, crises triggered by prime ministerial resignation or narrow election results. A dead heat at the polls would immediately see the Queen drawn once more into politics, flexing a muscle no weaker for being so rarely seen. Not all royal power is exercised by the monarch. The prime minister can govern like an absolute ruler because he has appropriated the royal prerogative: as Her Majesty's First Minister, he has inherited her powers to rule the United Kingdom. No republic starting from scratch would ever grant such powers to a president. But in Britain they were already there, bundled together and tied with purple string. They were simply passed from one hand to another in the Glorious Revolution. If Britons want to reform the elective dictatorship which concentrates more power in the hands of the British prime minister than almost any other comparable executive in the world, they will have to attack the source of that power - the crown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/15/food.foodanddrink1","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-15T13:34:33Z","webTitle":"'No early prospect of France taking the necessary steps to lift its import ban'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/15/food.foodanddrink1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/15/food.foodanddrink1","fields":{"headline":"'No early prospect of France taking the necessary steps to lift its import ban'","bodyText":"To Commissioner David Byrne Notwithstanding the clear legal position and unanimous conclusion of the Scientific Steering Committee that it does not share the concerns of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) about the safety of meat and meat products exported from the United Kingdom under the Date Based Export Scheme, France has continued to maintain its import ban on British beef. In a spirit of co-operation the United Kingdom has provided clarification on the five points of technical concern which were raised by the French authorities following the SSC's Opinion of 29 October. In these discussions on testing, we can support the position paper the Commission produced following the 5 November discussions. • On control we have explained that the controls we have in place are extremely rigorous. • On labelling we have shown a flexible attitude. In any event labelling has no implications for public health. • On the basis of the scheme, the herd system suggested by France is unsupported by science. • On processed products, no real problems have been demonstrated in the discussions. We have provided further data to demonstrate the sound scientific basis for the Scheme. I understand that the French authorities are now reflecting on the further explanations and data provided today. I hope that, on this basis, they will now announce that they are lifting the ban immediately. However, if, despite the clarifications put forward at the technical meetings involving UK and French officials and chaired by the Commission on 5 and 12 November, there appears to be no early prospect of France taking the necessary steps to lift its import ban, the United Kingdom considers that the Commission should on 16 November initiate legal action against France under Article 226 of the Treaty. In this case where there is a very clear failure to follow EU rules it would seem appropriate for a request to be lodged with the court for an expedited hearing. Naturally the United Kingdom would stand ready after the initiation of legal proceedings to co-operate with the Commission and France, and provide any further technical information so that EU rules can be applied throughout the Community."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/16/guardianobituaries2","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-16T01:46:48Z","webTitle":"Robert Kramer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/16/guardianobituaries2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/16/guardianobituaries2","fields":{"headline":"Robert Kramer","bodyText":"Before the American film director Robert Kramer, who has died of meningitis aged 60, settled in France nearly two decades ago, he was, in a way, an exile in his own country. \"I feel as if I'm a Martian,\" he said in the late 1970s. \"I'm broke. I've had to work as a truck driver for a year. I asked myself where my life is leading. Then the French National Institute of Audio-Visual Arts offered to fund a film by me.\" The said film never came to fruition, but he found French producers for Guns, a documentary on the Angolan civil war. After it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1980, Kramer took up residence in Paris. It was the natural home for a leftwing American director, out of sympathy with US policy. Born in New York, the son of a doctor, Kramer studied philosophy and western European history at Swarthmore College and Stanford University. After working on a community project among blacks in Newark, New Jersey, in 1965, he helped found the Newsreel Movement, which made some 60 documentaries and short films on political subjects between 1967 and 1971 when the anti-Vietnam war movement was growing. During the same period, Kramer continued his critique of society with features that trod the boundary between fiction and documentary, shooting in 16mm with non-professional actors. In The Country (1967) focused on one man's doubts about his fight against the US political system, and The Edge (1968) dealt with an assassination attempt on a war-mongering president. While Ice (1969) did not exactly \"explode in people's faces like a grenade\" and \"open minds like a can-opener\" - as Kramer had hoped - it was an effective ideological thriller on urban insurrection during an imagined war between the US and Mexico. In the 1970s Kramer went to Vietnam to make The People's War, which was criticised by the North Viet- namese for presenting \"a negative view of our country\". Milestones (1975), dedicated to \"the heroic Vietnamese people\", was a three-hour \"fictional documentary\", in which various people, including a war veteran, a student activist, members of a militant cell, and various peaceniks and draft dodgers expounded their views. Because of their length, subject matter and uncompromising cinema verité style, Kramer's films were admired more than liked, and were not easy to release. Nevertheless, two highly personal films on being an exile were released in the US: Doc's Kingdom (1987), a sombre reflection on a burnt-out American radical living in Portugal, who dreams of returning home, and Route One USA (1989), a road movie about a leftwing exile's return to his native land. Back in France, Kramer lectured on cinema and made films. Walk The Walk (1996) was a meditation on the state of Europe as seen through the eyes of a family man, who abandons everything to travel to Russia and onwards. Kramer believed in working with the smallest crews possible. \"I had a couple of experiences with full professional crews of 60-75 people, which I found extremely painful and uninteresting. It puts me in the position of military commander. There's not much need for all those people. Even with really complicated things... For Walk The Walk, it was five people - camera (me); a sound person, a sound assistant; a camera assistant for me; and someone who does the lighting.\" Last year, the good-looking and affable Kramer appeared as an American in Paris in Cedric Kahn's Ennui, and was planning further films, still sticking to his idealistic and minimalist principles. He is survived by his wife Erika, and their daughter Keja, as well as by a daughter from a previous marriage. • Robert Kramer, film director; born June 22, 1939; died November 10, 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/nov/17/parliament.uk1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-17T12:34:17Z","webTitle":"'My government believe this is a substantial programme of work'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/nov/17/parliament.uk1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/nov/17/parliament.uk1","fields":{"headline":"'My government believe this is a substantial programme of work'","bodyText":"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, This is my government's third legislative programme. It aims to build on my government's programme of reform as they seek to modernise the country and its institutions to meet the challenges of the new millennium. My government's aim is to promote fairness and enterprise, providing people with real opportunities to liberate their potential. They will focus on continued modernising of our economy, the promotion of enterprise, reform of the welfare system, protection of the public, and the development of a safe transport system. The central economic objectives of my government are high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. More people are in work in Britain today than ever before, with employment up by 700,000, and long term unemployment has halved. My government are helping people back into work. The new deal has helped 145,000 young people into employment. My government have introduced a national minimum wage and a new 10p starting rate of tax. They have reformed national insurance and from next April will cut the basic rate of income tax. The new working families tax credit, introduced in October, is raising incomes of working families. My government will continue to manage the public finances prudently, in accordance with the code for fiscal stability and the two fiscal rules. The new system of monetary policy-making ensures that interest rate decisions are taken in the best long-term interests of the economy. As a result, long-term interest rates are around their lowest level for almost thirty years. Inflation is historically low and expected to meet my government's target of 2.5%. My government will continue to work with others to promote economic reform in Europe. They will work for more open markets, greater economic growth and new job creation. To prepare Britain as a dynamic, knowledge-based economy my government will introduce a bill to promote electronic commerce and electronic government, improving our ability to compete in the digital marketplace. Financial services lie at the heart of a modern economy. The financial services industry accounts for 7% of our national income, employing over one million people. With the new financial services authority, my government are determined to maintain and advance the UK's position, and the bill introduced last session will be carried over to this. As part of my government's drive to address inappropriate and over-complex regulation, legislation will be introduced to increase the effectiveness of the power to remove regulatory burdens. My government will introduce a bill to enable the post office to improve its services and to compete more effectively in UK and overseas markets. To put the consumer first, cut prices and make utility regulation more transparent and accountable, a bill will be introduced to modernise the utility regulation system. Legislation will be introduced to assist the rescue of viable businesses in short-term difficulties, and improve the procedure for disqualifying unfit company directors. My government believe a stronger and fairer society strengthens our economy. They will continue to give young people and the long-term unemployed the opportunity to learn new skills and fulfil their potential. Education remains my government's number one priority. My government will continue to implement policies to reward good teaching, reduce infant class sizes, and continue the drive to build on the improvements in literacy and numeracy already achieved. Having focused change upon primary and secondary education, a bill will now be introduced to establish a new Learning and Skills Council to improve standards for post-16 education and training. As part of my government's drive against social exclusion, a bill will be introduced to improve the help available to young people leaving local authority care. To build on my government's modernisation of the welfare system, a bill will be introduced to reform child support so that money gets to children more speedily and effectively. It will introduce further pension reforms, including the state second pension which will give more help to low earners, carers and long-term disabled people with broken work records. And it will reinforce people's obligations to society by linking benefit entitlement to compliance with community sentences. Legislation will be introduced to improve the education of children with Special Educational Needs. My government are determined to promote fairness of opportunity for disabled people building on the establishment of a disability rights commission. Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public service will be laid before you. My Lords and members of the House of Commons, my government's 10-year programme of modernisation for health and social care will provide faster, more convenient services to help improve the country's health. As part of this programme, a bill will be introduced to improve standards and stamp out abuse in social services, in private and voluntary healthcare, and in childcare. My government are determined to reduce crime and improve public protection. A bill will be introduced to extend the use of mandatory drug testing in the criminal justice system. It will reform the probation services in England and Wales, create a new children and family court advisory service, and prevent unsuitable people from working with children. A bill will be introduced to give the courts themselves the power to decide whether certain defendants should be tried by jury or by magistrates. The bill to equalise the age of consent, and strengthen the protection of young people from abuse of trust, will be re-introduced. My government are determined to combat terrorism. A bill will be introduced to modernise and make permanent the powers available to respond to all forms of terrorism. A bill will be introduced to ensure that the interception of communications, and the use of other intrusive techniques, continues to be regulated for the protection both of the rights of individuals and of society as a whole. The report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence raised profound issues for our multi-racial society. A bill will be introduced which will make it unlawful for public bodies to racially discriminate, implementing one of the report's key recommendations. A bill will be introduced to give people greater access to the countryside and to improve protection for wildlife. And my government will continue their leading role in protecting the global climate. My government are committed to creating a modern integrated and safe transport system, providing more choice for the travelling public. Following the recent tragedy at Paddington my government will ensure that rail safety is a top priority. A bill will be re-introduced to establish a strategic rail authority. It will contain measures to improve bus services and reduce road congestion. It will include measures for national air traffic services to separate safety regulation from operational matters, and deliver major investment in the next generation technology. My government will bring forward a bill to introduce the latest accounting methods to improve value for money in Whitehall and generate more investment in public infrastructure and front-line services. A bill will be brought forward to allow firms to incorporate with limited liability whilst organising themselves as partnerships. A bill will be introduced to modernise the powers and duties of trustees. My Lords and members of the House of Commons, In Northern Ireland, my government will continue to work closely with the political parties and the Irish government to secure the full implementation of the Good Friday agreement. A bill will be presented to implement proposals from the independent commission on policing, following the completion of consultation.

A bill will be introduced to set up an electoral commission to regulate the funding and spending of political parties and organisations. My government will also bring forward a bill to reform our electoral procedures to make it easier for people to participate in elections. My government are committed to further long-term reform of the House of Lords and will look forward to the recommendations of the royal commission on the reform of the House of Lords. A bill will be brought forward to reform local government to make it more innovative and accountable. My government will introduce a bill on freedom of information. It will give everyone the right of access to information held across the public sector for the first time. My government will continue to provide greater openness by publishing legislation in draft for public scrutiny. This will include bills enabling the United Kingdom to ratify the international criminal court, promoting more efficient water use and leasehold reform as well as commonhold for flat-owners. Other measures will be laid before you. The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to receiving a state visit by Her Majesty Queen Margrethe of Denmark and Prince Henrik in February next year. We also look forward to our visit to Australia in March. My government will work towards a new partnership between Britain and the Overseas Territories. They will take forward the offer of British Citizenship to the people of the Territories. My government will take a leading role with our partners to shape the future development of the European Union. They will promote the enlargement of the Union, support co-operation in the fight against cross-border crime and work to improve the effectiveness of the European Union's foreign and security policy and its development programmes. My government will ensure that Nato remains the foundation of Britain's defence and security. They will seek to continue the work of adapting the alliance to meet the challenges and opportunities of the new century. A bill will be introduced to reform aspects of the armed forces' system for administering discipline. My government will seek to modernise the United Nations. They will work to make the Security Council more effective and more representative. Over the coming year, which is the 10th anniversary of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, my government will build on their work to strengthen protection for children. My government will take further measures to meet its target of abolishing child poverty in 20 years. It will play an active part in the Council of Europe conference against racism. My government believe this is a substantial programme of work, addressing their priorities and helping the country to meet the challenges of the new millennium.

All you need to do now to complete your thesis is call each of the respondents and probe the ideological reasons behind their choice. It's an idea prompted by last night's George Orwell memorial lecture, in which the distinguished political scientist, Bernard Crick pondered \"The English Problem: National Identity and Citizenship\". Crick suspected that such a study would show that \"British\" was the term chosen by all \"new, post-1953\" immigrants and that those who wrote \"UK\" were almost certainly members of the Northern Ireland Alliance party or Scottish Tories. But his real interest lay in the large majority from this country who write \"English - probably doing so because of the mistaken belief that \"English\" is an adjective corresponding to \"citizen of the United Kingdom\". They're hardly likely to be drawing upon any deep sense of English identity, because none such exists. When one checks out \"nationalism\" in a library catalogue, says Crick, the best that \"English\" can produce are \"a handful of very bad, ultra-patriotic books about the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 or the nature of the Empire from 1870 to 1914\". Why such neglect? Crick suggests that Britain has only been held together for the last three centuries through \"an almost deliberate suppression by the English majority of English nationalism and self-consciousness\". When nationalism was sweeping through Europe in the 19th century, the wily old Tories knew that any assertion of English nationalism would have been politically counter-productive. But the time has now come for the English to develop an explicit national feeling, one that draws upon \"the radical tradition of positive citizenship as well as the establishment tradition of the loyal subject and law and order\". Perhaps, Crick concludes, teaching citizenship in schools might help. He's well placed to further such a project. His current letter heading reveals him to be chairman of the Advisory Group on the Teaching of Citizenship at the department of education and employment. • Laurie Taylor talks to Bernard Crick about the problem of English identity in Radio 4's Thinking Allowed at 4pm today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/nov/18/northernireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-18T13:37:40Z","webTitle":"'It may not be trust yet, but it's an important start'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/18/northernireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/nov/18/northernireland","fields":{"headline":"'It may not be trust yet, but it's an important start'","bodyText":"I indicated in my last statement on November 15 that I expected to be in a position to issue a concluding report on the review soon after the publication of the assessment on the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) and of the parties' positions on the issues which we have been considering together in the review. Those steps have now been taken. Together they represent a set of extremely positive developments. I welcome the statements from the parties, which should further build mutual confidence in each other's commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday agreement and to the three principles as agreed on 25 June, namely: • an inclusive executive exercising devolved powers • decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000 • decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the IICD. I also welcome the IICD assessment of how it can best achieve the mandate under the agreement. I share its conclusion that decommissioning is by definition a voluntary act and cannot be imposed. To bring decommissioning about, the commission will need the cooperation and support of the political parties, using all the influence they have, together with the wholehearted commitment of paramilitary organisations. While decommissioning is an essential element of the agreement, the context in which it can be achieved is the overall implementation of that agreement. All participants have a collective responsibility in this regard. In response to the IICD assessment, the parties have made clear that the IICD is the agreed mechanism for achieving decommissioning, under the terms of the Good Friday agreement. In the light of these and other encouraging developments, including the proposed appointment of authorised representatives of paramilitary organisations to the IICD, I believe that a basis now exists for devolution to occur, for the institutions to be established, and for decommissioning to take place as soon as possible. Devolution should take effect, then the executive should meet, and then the paramilitary groups should appoint their authorised representatives, all on the same day, in that order. I hereby recommend to the governments and the parties that they make the necessary arrangements to proceed, and call on them to do so without delay. That completes the review, and with it my role in this process. I conclude with some personal comments. Not long ago, the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein did not speak directly. In the early weeks of the review, their exchanges were harsh and filled with recrimination. But gradually, as one of them put it, \"trust crept in\". It may not be trust yet, but it's an important start, and the discussions did become serious and meaningful. For that credit goes to the leaders, David Trimble and Sir Reg Empey; and Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. They, and the other leaders of their parties, set aside their hostility for the good of their society. The Social Democratic and Labour Party, led by John Hume and Seamus Mallon, provided crucial insight and involvement. It will play an important role in the Executive. The leaders of the other pro-Agreement parties were strongly supportive: Sean Neeson and Seamus Close of Alliance, David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist Party, Monica McWilliams and Jane Morrice of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, and Gary McMichael and David Adams of the Ulster Democratic Party; and all of their colleagues. They and their parties were essential to the Good Friday agreement. They are indispensable to its full implementation. It cannot and will not be done without them. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and Ireland, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, and President Clinton, played important roles in this effort, as did Mo Mowlam, David Andrews and Liz O'Donnell. The new secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, is a strong and effective leader who, in a short time, has had an enormous positive impact. I also would like to recognise two superb officials, Bill Jeffrey for the British, and Dermot Gallagher for the Irish. With their colleagues, they provided me with invaluable assistance, for which they have my gratitude. As a result of all of these efforts, neither side will get all it wanted and both will endure severe political pain. But there is no other way forward. Prolonging the stalemate will leave this society uncertain and vulnerable. If this process succeeds, the real winners will be the people, who want their political leaders to work out their differences through democratic dialogue. I have been involved in this effort for nearly five years. I cannot say that I've enjoyed every minute of it. But while on occasion it has been difficult, it has also been one of the most meaningful times of my life. I am totally committed to the cause of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. And I can say that the longer I've been here the more I have come to admire and like and believe in the people. They're energetic and productive, warm and generous. I have been treated here as though I were at home. In a sense I am at home, because my emotions and a part of my heart will be here forever, even though I will not always be physically present. My thanks to you ladies and gentlemen of the press for your courtesy, to the prime minister and taoiseach for inviting me to take part in this process, to the party leaders with whom I have spent these past few months and who I respect for their courage, and, finally, to the people for their warmth and hospitality. I hope to return often, in other capacities. My fervent prayer is that it will be to a society in which hope and opportunity are alive and where a durable peace, tolerance and mutual respect are not distant dreams, but rather are the reality of daily life for all of the people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/nov/18/features11.g21","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-18T14:22:21Z","webTitle":"Shine on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/nov/18/features11.g21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/nov/18/features11.g21","fields":{"headline":"Shine on","bodyText":"The slim, tanned figure in the cream Cossack shirt and black trousers comes bounding on for a third encore as the audience rises to its feet in the Sydney concert hall. He beams and bows. The audience, some wiping tears from their eyes, cheers. It is a night of triumph. It could be the scene from a film. In fact, it almost is a scene from a film. For the pianist taking the bow is David Helfgott, the inspiration for Shine, the story of an Australian musical prodigy who is laid low by mental illness and institutionalisation, redeemed by his music, rediscovered and finds love. Shine was a mighty hit, its star Geoffrey Rush deservedly won a best actor Oscar in 1997, and its director Scott Hicks has gone on to direct Snow Falling on Cedars. But what happened to Helfgott, now aged 52, the person so hauntingly portrayed by Rush? Was the ending really a happy one? We are in the presidential suite of the Hilton hotel in Sydney, a few days before Helfgott is to open the new Angel Place recital hall with a solo concert. There is a group of fellow musicians and friends assembled here by Helfgott's wife Gillian, an astrologer, who met David in 1983 and decided that they were fated to be together, as indeed they have been ever since; they married on an astrologically benign day in 1984. Among the guests is 18-year-old Simon Tedeschi, another musical prodigy, who has been in an adjoining room with David watching Judge Judy, the American television show in which a judge rules on small claims cases for television viewers. It's one of David's favourite programmes. David greets each new arrival - his long-time friends conductor Gerald Krug and jazz pianist Kevin Hunt - with an affectionate hug and a running commentary on proceedings. What strikes most people about meeting David Helfgott for the first time is his cheerful physicality: an immediate arm round the shoulder, a mid-conversation hug, a kiss on the forehead on departing. He has an encyclopaedic knowledge which makes him an expert at Trivial Pursuit - although he cannot resist giving everyone else's answers. Our introduction prompts an instant quotation from Macbeth - \"Duncan is in his grave; after life's fitful fever he sleeps well\" - and a burst of \"The Campbells are coming, the Campbells are coming\", in what is his trademark free-association style of speech. It is three days before the Australian referendum in which the electorate will decide whether they want to replace the Queen with a president. One newspaper has whimsically suggested that David - along with singer Kylie Minogue, cricketer Mark Taylor and swimmer Dawn Fraser - is a potential candidate. David and Gillian are much amused by this, not least because they are booked into the Hilton's presidential suite. (\"David's got the sun and moon in Taurus - he loves luxury,\" explains Gillian later.) We meet again the following day. David is having a long and leisurely bath - he loves the water and usually swims three hours a day - so it is Gillian who talks first of the life that the success of Shine has opened up to them. This year he has performed to packed houses around the world: Japan, Portugal, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. There have been big concerts raising money for the Kosovo refugees and for mental health charities, and he has played with the Australian rock band silverchair on their CD, Neon Ballroom. Next year, it will be Japan again, Spain, and the United Kingdom before a rest in 2001. \"Japan has been extraordinary,\" says Gillian. \"The audience is very loyal and comes back time after time. They are beautiful and they do express their affection to David. David is so different to the concept of the concert pianist: here is this wonderfully warm, joyous human being and it's this childlike quality that breaks down barriers.\" The barriers have come down spectacularly. In the wake of the film, 4,000 people saw him play in Atlanta, 10,000 at the Hollywood Bowl and he filled the Albert Hall. The fame that came with Shine has brought commercial success, too. One of his three CDs, Rachmaninov, the Last Great Romantic, sold 800,000 copies and was Billboard magazine's classical record of the year. Gillian's book, Love You To Bits and Pieces, has sold 200,000 copies and made it onto the New York Times bestsellers list. With success comes security: \"I'm 68 now and I know that if I slip on a banana skin next week, David will be all right,\" says Gillian, who was played by Lynn Redgrave in the film. It has also helped them to create the dream retreat: a large house with five acres, a solar-heated swimming pool, a Japanese garden and a lagoon, set in a valley in the appropriately named Promised Land on the sub-tropical northern coast of New South Wales. From this oasis they make their sorties out to the concerts. In the old pre-Shine days when David played mainly in Australia, Germany and Denmark, Gillian would act as roadie and manager. Now, there are agents, even the occasional limo at the airport. They try to oblige the promoters by playing what the fans request: \"David mostly wants to play romantic pieces. There is a lot of sadness and anger in the world. David doesn't like discord - he's had enough in his life - and people respond to beautiful music so that's what he wants to play: Chopin, Beethoven, Liszt, Rachmaninov, Tchaikovsky. His performance repertoire remains classical but could change: \"The other night he played Cry Me a River, one of my favourites - he had it just right.\" While some of David's siblings have been unhappy with the way their family life was portrayed in Shine, and in particular with the casting of their father Peter Helfgott as a prime cause of David's breakdown, Gillian feels that nothing but good has come from the film for David: \"Scott [Hicks] will have my gratitude for ever. David is a lot better now than when Scott met him. We handed our lives over to him and Scott made a film that was, in David's words, 'true to the essence of my life'.\" The fame that accompanies the film is welcome for David, she says. \"He relishes every second when he's recognised. When someone comes up to him it's as if you've switched on a light.\" David has finished his bath and joins us in his towelling robe. \"They're a great team, a great team,\" he says of the musicians who had played with him the previous night. \"They inspire me. You can't do it on your own, can't do it on your own. You have to acknowledge that.\" Although his breakdown first manifested itself in 1970 when he was studying in London at the Royal College of Music, he has other more recent happy memories of Britain, he says. In London, he stayed \"first in the Jewish bit [Golders Green], then in the Irish bit [Willesden].\" Scotland prompts talk of Scapa Flow and Chicago brings up jazz. \"People ask me my thoughts on it. Nothing wrong with it. It's an extra source of amusement, isn't it? Must be flexible, mustn't be too rigid.\" Where is he happiest touring? \"In the here and now - we must live in the here and now - but it's nice to get back home, it's paradise there, paradise.\" But being on stage is still the highlight. \"He says he feels a whole person when he's performing,\" says Gillian. \"He makes love to a piano when he performs.\" But does the piano love him back? This has been the big issue for some critics who have been scornful of his performance, suggesting something manipulative in the whole exercise. Gillian is well aware of the critics' ire. She says that he had been performing to great reviews in Europe from 1987 until just before the film came out. \"Then suddenly he goes to America and they say he can't play the piano: what happened overnight?\" A critical review in Newsweek had been followed by one in Boston. \"David didn't play his best in Boston but he got four standing ovations. The next morning on the radio they said this was a very sad occasion. David asked, 'How could four standing ovations be a very sad occasion?'\" In San Francisco, the headline was: \"Surprise - Helfgott can play.\" Gillian is impressed by the way that David has not been thrown by the reviews: \"My admiration for him is boundless, but if you've been in a mental institution for 12 years the critics can't crush you.\" She says she has been heartened by support from harmonica player and writer Larry Adler who told her that David was \"the greatest communicator of any classical music he had ever heard\". And this is what David's supporters point out: that he has brought classical music to a whole new audience of young people who would never previously have gone to a recital, much as Pavarotti introduced the football fans of the world to opera when he sang Nessum Dorma as the theme for the World Cup in Italy in 1990. And so to the Angel Place opening. The house is almost full. There is warm applause as David comes on and bows deeply, sits down and starts playing Granados' Andaluza from 10 Danzas Espanolas. As he plays his Ravel and Liszt he talks to himself as though in a private conversation with some invisible muse poised at the side of the Steinway. In the foyer, Gillian watches on a monitor, willing him on: \"Lovely, David, lovely.\" After a second half of Rachmaninov's three preludes and a Beethoven sonata, the show ends to three encores, the final one a brief Flight of the Bumble Bee. By then almost the entire audience is on its feet. There are cheers and tears. By Monday morning, it is clear why not quite everyone was standing. \"A colourless recital\" is the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald's review by Peter McCallum. \"David Helfgott is not in my view anything resembling a great artist,\" writes McCallum. \"When the audience nonetheless leapt to its feet, one felt a strange negotiation for applause between pianist and audience which was partly innocent and partly discomforting and mutually patronising and exploitative.\" Of David's interpretation of Ravel's Ondine - \"plain and literal\" - McCallum writes that \"any other pianist would be pilloried for this\". Helfgott's team had anticipated a bad review from McCallum, but the criticism, however crushing it sets out to be, seems to miss the point. David Helfgott is performing something much more complicated than a piece of music. He is not just a pianist but an escape artist, and by giving people an opportunity to share in his triumph over adversity, however corny it may sound, he brings something different and edgy to the music. To an untutored ear and to many of his (highly musical) friends, his playing is a delight, and to judge the show within the narrow parameters of the concert hall seems petty. Telling people that their enjoyment of music is \"patronising\" is, in itself, patronising. After the recital, David is standing at the door of his dressing room already changed into a snappy black and red outfit. There is a hug: \"Oh, the Campbells are coming, the Campbells are coming.\" A stream of fans and friends wind their way up past the stage door to greet him and soon he will be bathing again, this time in a warm glow. David Helfgott's story is a complex one and only he and those closest to him can really understand the twist it has taken since the light of Hollywood was shone on it. But for someone who might have been chain-smoking alone, drugged up on sedatives in an institution, but who now plays and swims to his heart's content in the company of a woman who loves him, and surrounded by people whom he can hug without being rejected or sectioned, it is surely not hard to decide what has been for the best. Shine on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/1999/nov/20/oman","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-20T18:00:45Z","webTitle":"Shifting sands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/nov/20/oman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/1999/nov/20/oman","fields":{"headline":"Shifting sands","bodyText":"The road that bowls south in an endless straight line from the old fort town of Nizwa to Salalah, Oman's second city, is stamped upon a landscape that an amateur eye might reasonably describe as featureless. Here are desert plains, not of undulating sand and dune but of flat, bone-hard limestone sprinkled with chunks of gravel. The unnerving emptiness is relieved only by an occasional camel casually lumbering out of nowhere. Wilfred Thesiger, desert lover supreme, described these parts as \"a bitter desiccated land which knows nothing of gentleness and ease\" and the gravel plains as places \"where monotony was emphasised by the mirages shimmering through the heat\". Then suddenly there was more than mirage: near a place - well, a signpost really - called Ramkt Umm Zumaim, appeared, in rapid succession, what looked like a scattered used-car lot, an army camp and a sand dune. Only the sand dune was what it seemed. The used-car lot came into focus, sharpening into groups of Bedu. No longer travelling by camel, they had congregated with their pick-up trucks, each family group parking itself and its vehicle beside an acacia bush. And the army camp? It was no less than the court of Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman. His Majesty was on his yearly meet-the-people walkabout. With its fluttering flags, the royal encampment looked like the setting for a medieval pageant (although undoubtedly equipped with e-mail). The camp was spread out beside a stunning golden sand-dune arising like a crown from the plains; sculptured and scalloped, its contours provided the afternoon sun with somewhere to rest its heavy beams. The Bedu had come - as they always had done - with requests and tributes, or perhaps just to see their leader, whose reputation seems remarkably undimmed after nearly three decades on the throne. Sultan Qaboos rules over a kingdom that has seen mighty leaps - from feudalism to modernism - in a couple of decades. In 1970, with the help of the British, Qaboos forced his father to abdicate. Since then, in a period that the Omanis call the Renaissance, Qaboos, who rules largely through appointed advisers - there is a limited franchise and a parliament with limited powers - has delivered much to his people. A full education system, hospitals, highways and the paraphernalia of globalisation (Pepsi-Cola, Lipton Tea, Pringles, Mitsubishi to name but a few) is part of the phenomenon of modern Oman. He has also provided Omanis with plots of land and subsidised housing: so that out of the desert has emerged a domestic architecture that couples Byzantine with Virginia Water; crenellated mansions topped by satellite dishes and enclosed by high walls - the latter to create the traditional private space for Omani women to go about their household chores and social encounters undisturbed. There is a hint of Singapore about Muscat, the capital, and the adjoining towns of Mutrah and Ruwi, squeezed between the mountains and the sea: the steamy heat, glittering new buildings (although no high rises), manicured highways intercepted by outsize roundabouts and kitsch public monuments. There is no litter, not a discarded date stone to be seen. (Is it really true that an unwashed car can prompt a fine?) But the old is cherished, too. The fine old port area of Muscat and the corniche and souk at Mutrah have been carefully conserved. So, too, has the Beit Al Zubair, the former home of one of Oman's leading families and now a heritage museum. And even more evocative are the handfuls of jasmine petals and nuggets of frankincense in the alleys of the Mutrah souk. If the built modern landscape sometimes has an air of invention, the Omani people seem sure of who they are and where they are going. They see themselves - and expatriates would agree - as an open-minded, outward-looking people (they were after all great seafarers who explored - and sometimes controlled - parts of China, India, Iran and East Africa). Hospitable, generous, stylish, they insist that their modernisation drive will not cut them off from their past. \"We have the gift of stability. We are not in a hurry,\" said the man from the ministry of information. So, the Sultan insists, for example, that his male civil servants wear a white dishdash (which happens to be both dishy and dashing), the traditional robe, to work. It is, in any case, common attire, and also seen in fragrant mauve. Tourism was, until recently, discouraged. The reason: a threat to traditional values. That policy has now changed, although that \"threat\" may well remain. Nevertheless, Oman now welcomes tourism. And there is much to see. Most evenings, before dusk, cavalcades of four-wheel-drives arrive at the remote and rugged beach of Ra's Al Jinz, close to the most eastern point of the Arabian peninsula. The visitors (mainly expatriates) have come to see the green turtles, to witness one of the great spectacles of the natural world - the coming and going from the sea of these large reptiles, who return to the beach, where many years earlier they had been born, to lay their eggs. We congregate with Ali, the ranger, who motions us to where a turtle has dug a hole and is laying her eggs. Ali crouches down beside it, lifts a back flipper and we watch as the shiny, ping-pong-ball shapes drop in a heap onto the sand. There is a full moon, which, according to Ali, is \"no good time turtle\": but just to see one egg-laying turtle is amazing enough. The miracle continues at dawn the next morning, when with the sky a seamless pink, it is time for the turtles to take their leave. Leaving their eggs to hatch, inshallah, they heave their way down the beach, making exquisite tracks in the sand. When they reach the glassy sea, they wait for a wave to break, and then, bringing their head up for one last time, plunge in and are gone. Even without a developed tourist industry, the turtles attract a crowd. Ali is agitated by the fact that sometimes up to 200 people arrive in one night. Although you need a permit from Muscat to enter the reserve, there seems to be no limit on numbers. The problems around environmental tourism, its management and who benefits are only just beginning. Helping to support the turtle reserve are \"venturers\" from the British-based charity, Raleigh International. Seventy young volunteers (between 17 and 25 and from 22 countries, including Oman) have been in the country since September working on a variety of environmental and community projects. At Ra's Al Jinz, for example, they are building a wall to keep out scavenging camels, spending blazing days hand-mixing concrete and slapping breeze-blocks into place; and their nights camping under the stars. Raleigh International seems to have changed its philosophy since it was called Operation Raleigh, run by Colonel John Blashford-Snell. Then, its image seemed to have a military whiff and a public-schoolboy ethos. Now, not only does Raleigh emphasise its internationalism, but recruits from inner-cities as well as graduates and gap-year folk. If the venturers find themselves doing unglamorous physical labour, they are also having adventures in some extraordinarily remote locations. At Wadi Shab, for example, the Raleigh camp is in the sort of paradise glade that Arab lyricists might invoke: a wadi (valley) of birdsong and orchards, where you can dip in sweet pools, swim up steep-sided gorges and receive gifts of bananas and lemons from villagers. The project here is the cleaning and repair of a falaj, the ancient irrigation system, which provides precious water for cultivation. Among the venturers ankle-deep in water on a hillside are José from Chile; two Chinese venturers, Fei Xu and Jeremy from the People's Republic; Abdullah from Oman; Beckie, who works for a family support group in Brighton; Dudze from Zimbabwe, who is off to Oxford Brookes University and whose father, it was rumoured, is a friend of the president; and Hannamaya from Finland, who has just finished her international baccalauréat. One of the Raleigh staff members - who, like the venturers, have fund-raised to be there - says that those who get the most out of it are not necessarily the best- travelled and most confident venturers, but the ones who have come - mentally - the furthest. For John from Manchester, a dreamy 18-year-old, who did his fund-raising by a \"tin shake round the city centre and canoeing around Salford Quays\", it was the first time he had been on a plane, his first time outside England. Far to the south of the gentle greenness of Wadi Shab is Jaluuni, in the middle of the harsh Jiddat al Harasis. Here, another project is being supported by Raleigh. To get there at all seems amazing - it is 30 miles from the nearest road and seems bereft of all landmarks; but it is, of course, common ground to the Bedu rangers who guide us. Here, the future of the rare white oryx is the priority. \"It is sad to think that the Arabian oryx ... are also doomed as soon as cars penetrate into the southern desert,\" wrote Thesiger in Arabian Sands, in 1959. Thesiger, who himself had taken a pot-shot at an oryx (and missed), was right, but he had not reckoned on a doughty band of conservationists who would mastermind a \"save the oryx\" programme. By 1972, oryx were gone from the wild (they had once roamed all over the Arabian peninsula and north in to Syria and Iraq), but a few did, however, exist in zoos. So the object of the exercise, said Ralph Daly, the Sultan's adviser on all things environmental, was \"to bring them back to Oman and release them\". With the good Sultan's support (both financial and otherwise), a 30,000 square kilometre Arabian Oryx Sanctuary centred on Jaluuni, was set aside. Re-introduction began in 1982. It was reckoned to be a text-book success story. Numbers had increased to 450 by the mid-1990s. These elegant antelopes, with their graceful curving horns (it is said that the oryx was the inspiration for the unicorn) have an extraordinary capacity to survive. They can go without free water, it is said, for two years, feeding from plants with high water content, grazing on dewy foliage (from the fogs that breeze in from the east) and even licking each others' coats for moisture. But once again the poachers arrived; and once again the oryx had to be protected: and while 108 remain in the wild; 48 are now back in the Jaluuni enclosure. \"But it's a new era,\" says the positive Daly. Security is in place, and the oryx will shortly return to their rightful habitat on the gravel plains. We took off into the wilderness, to see a little of that elusive desert wildlife and to peer over the edge of the magnificent Huqf escarpment. \"Just soak up the atmosphere,\" Daly said, musing on the oryx's graceful gallop. Our guide was Louti, a pigeon-toed Bedu famed as a tracker. He showed us a desert hare, motionless under a bush; the criss-crossing tracks and droppings of gazelle (for the record, they smell sweet and herby), oryx and camel, and then the animals themselves. And there was the escarpment itself, stretching in a haze of purple and browns into the everafter, where the survival of the smallest herb, the most shrivelled bush is something of a wonder. A little later, Louti swung off to check on two vehicles hurtling across the landscape. He reported back that they were local people, on their pilgrimage to see the Sultan, still receiving his people beside that very splendid, very isolated golden sand-dune. Something ventured...

From the mosque to the bar, the ejection from power this month of Interior Minister Driss Basri was hailed as a liberation. For a generation, he had muzzled Moroccans with 'administrative measures', from house arrest to travel bans. Now, security sources say, Basri's ranch near Rabat is under police guard and 30 associates - governors and top businessmen just days ago considered untouchables - have had their passports withdrawn and their names released to the press. His wife, Fatiha, and three of his children are among them. Basri rose through the secret police to serve for 25 years as the iron fist of King Hassan II. From blind, unemployed demonstrators to unwitting families living on coveted land, Moroccans spent a generation ducking the blows, threats and extortion of his bullyboys. His fall was as brutal as it was swift. On a trip out of town, Morocco's 37-year-old monarch, Mohammed VI, who replaced his father Hassan II in July, sent his intelligence services to change the locks at the Interior Ministry, and then had Basri's dismissal announced on the one o'clock news. Basri was never allowed back to his office. His successor said that he would work to reinforce freedom and democracy in Morocco. Investigations have begun into how the son of a provincial janitor rose to become one of the wealthiest men in the kingdom. His assets include a floodlit golf-course in Bouznika Bay, two high-society tourist resorts, and a £1.5 million Paris duplex by the Seine. Four million Moroccans live on less than a dollar a day. As his empire collapses around him, Basri scuttles for cover in the orange and eucalyptus groves of his golf club. He spends his days clinging on to his last remaining official title as president of the Royal Golf Federation and seeking to improve his handicap of 15. Critics say he is less dangerous hitting balls than people. Moroccans are rallying to their new King in celebration at Basri's downfall. Young men queue at the barbers for a royal crop, the military shave the King has revived as a Moroccan vogue. In Geneva, a torture victim has submitted a petition against Basri for crimes against humanity. It is unlikely the full truth will ever be known. Days before Basri fell, a fire ripped through the documentary centre of the Interior Ministry's secret service, the DST, in Temara, south of Rabat, reducing the ministry's accounts to ashes. But as the King struggles to cut Morocco loose from Basri's tentacles - he controlled everything from dustbin collections to rigged elections - there is mounting concern at just how liberal Morocco will become. From the director-general at the Interior Ministry, Fouad Ali el-Himma, to the new head of the state press agency, Mohammed Yassine Mansouri, the King is appointing his trusted schoolmates to all the top jobs. The purge could escalate into a witch hunt. The same press that weeks ago cowered at an Interior Ministry summons now dubs Basri's associates 'collaborators'. Policemen rifle briefcases and cars of Interior Ministry employees, before they are allowed home. Basri's three closest aides are reported to have disappeared. Hassan Aourid, the spokesman for the King, defended the attack on Basri's security apparatus. 'The last King was a prisoner of the system he created; the new King will have a better margin of manoeuvre.' But observers worry that Mohammed VI, who prom-ised democratic reforms, is growing despotic, and ignoring the institutions of state. Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssifi was out of the country, and apparently unaware, when Basri was sacked. Mohammed VI still keeps the country's foremost Islamist leader, Abdessalame Yassine, under house arrest for refusing to kiss his hand. Under the Constitution, the King is sacred, and criticism can result in imprisonment. Even so, Morocco is basking in an unprecedented political openness. Basri was a master of repression. Political prisoners fortunate to leave his prisons alive recall being strapped to ceiling fans and spun like helicopters, as janitors clubbed them from below. Basri signed the order stripping the Jewish Communist, Abraham Sefarty, of his passport after he had spent 17 years in jail for rabble-rousing. Sefarty was declared a Brazilian (his father had lived there) and deported to France. Basri was bashing victims to the last. On 31 October, his police beat up demonstrators in the disputed Western Sahara, raising tensions to their highest point since 1991, when Morocco agreed to a UN referendum on self-determination for the territory. Police struck women on the back of the head and, say diplomats, pincered others with pliers until their flesh split open. But not all are cheering the firing of Basri. Some praise him as a saviour who kept Morocco stable when Islamist militancy threatened to spill over from Algeria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/21/letters.letters7","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-21T02:12:47Z","webTitle":"Choices and cures for a killer disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/21/letters.letters7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/21/letters.letters7","fields":{"headline":"Choices and cures for a killer disease","bodyText":"Nigella Lawson (Comment, last week) was right to draw attention to the lottery of cancer cures and the disparity of treatment around the United Kingdom. But it is not simply a matter of access to drugs. More than 90 per cent of cancer cures result from surgery - yet surgery only received 1 per cent of cancer research funding. For today's sufferers, there is unequal access to best surgery. For example, around 10,000 people develop rectal cancer every year. More than 60 per cent of these die within five years. However, in specialist surgical centres performing a highly developed surgical technique (Total Mesorectal Excision), more than 60 per cent survive five years. The improvement is due to careful, precise and intact removal of all the tissue which may contain cancer. The result is a dramatic reduction in the chance of the cancer returning to the pelvis. This precise surgery coupled with modern stapling instruments allows a permanent colostomy to be avoided in most cases. If every hospital produced such good results, some 1,800 lives would be saved each year. We can't cure every cancer. But we can do much better than we're doing today. Dianne Hayter North Hampshire Hospital Basingstoke It was right for Nigella Lawson to admit that she is less than objective on the subject of cancer. But being a patient myself, I can understand her having strong feelings. I know what it feels like to be told that your case is terminal, that there is supposedly nothing that anyone can do. But Nigella misconstrues the process whereby seriously ill cancer patients turn to complementary medicine, sometimes as a last resort. I know because I did turn to complementary medicine as a last resort. It saved my life. Nigella is perfectly entitled to share her husband's well known scepticism about complementary therapies, but must she label and disparage all unconventional options 'mad and futile alternative treatments', dispensed to millions by 'local yogi'? Many of these treatments, such as the Bristol Cancer Help Centre's holistic approach, are complementary - that is, designed to complement orthodox NHS treatment - and are only 'alternative' for patients like myself when mainstream medicine has given up. I am delighted for Nigella and her husband John that he has access to the best practitioners and the best care at the Royal Marsden, but I can't help wondering whether this splendid beacon of hope of orthodox medicine can match the Bristol Cancel Help Centre when it comes to fully mobilising formidable patient resources in the very best of complementary care.

The composer with a record-breaking string of West End hits to his credit, is seeking local talent for The Beautiful Game, which he has written with Ben Elton. It tells the story of a teenage football team, growing up in Belfast against the background of the republican hunger strikes. A spokesman for the production said this would be Lloyd-Webber's millennium project, and the composer expects it to be up there with his previous hits such as Cats and Phantom of the Opera. No single news item of recent weeks illustrates more vividly how the peace dividend could affect Northern Ireland's image in the world and its hopes for new prosperity. There have been gritty films and plays about the Troubles, but they have all concentrated on the violence in a divided community. It would have been unthinkable, even five years ago, for the kind of hit musical associated with Lloyd-Webber to be set in Belfast. Over the past 30 years the violence has inflicted terrible damage, not just on relationships between people, but on the economy. Not surprisingly, it has been extremely difficult to attract foreign investment. Brave attempts have been made to develop tourism, but the obstacles have been almost overwhelming. I remember visiting a holiday exhibition in London some years ago, after a particularly ugly atrocity. The Northern Ireland stand was a forlorn sight: it was as though people were reluctant to approach it for fear of an explosion. As a result, the province has some of the most unspoilt and beautiful countryside in the British Isles - long sandy beaches and whitewashed villages. There have been improvements in recent years. After the first IRA ceasefire in l994, there was a surge of goodwill, and money came from the European Community and from international funds devoted to the cause of peace in Ireland. Belfast began to look like a normal city and property prices rose. But it has still been difficult to attract investment of the kind necessary to create 'real jobs' which guarantee prosperity. This has gone to the Irish Republic and helped to build the Celtic Tiger economy. Unemployment in Northern Ireland is down, but the average family income still lags behind that in the rest of the United Kingdom. With a peace settlement tantalisingly close, the image of Northern Ireland could change dramatically. For years economists have been lecturing the politicians on the difference the peace dividend will make to the economy. There has already been more investment, particularly from the United States. Last year more than half of the new software developments in the United Kingdom went to the province. But political instability and the ever-present fear of a return to violence have been powerful deterrents. Last week Michael Sullivan, the US ambassador to Dublin, told a conference of industrialists in Belfast: 'From an American perspective there is one simple economic truth - peace and jobs are inextricably linked.' The business community and the trade unions are well aware of this. They have co-operated in appealing to the politicians to agree a settlement. Last July, when the debacle at Stormont cast a pall of gloom over the whole peace process, a group of them set up the Make It Work campaign. Posters appeared across the province carrying the slogan: 'Don't be chicken - do the deal'. Earlier this month the Northern Ireland Economy Minister, John McFall, set up a new Economic Development Forum as part of the official blueprint for the province. 'Northern Ireland - Strategy 2010' was drawn up after consultations with industry, the unions, farming and the voluntary sector. It concentrates heavily on education, information technology, research, and development. It envisages a growth in the North's gross domestic product from 80 per to 90 per cent relative to that of the rest of the UK. There are still problems to be resolved. A recent survey showed that the incomes of Catholic families are still substantially lower than those of Protestants, and that long-term unemployment remains an obdurate problem in nationalist areas west of the River Bann. Last Wednesday, as details of the political choreography began to emerge from Stormont Castle, the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce was holding its annual dinner in Belfast. The chairman, Owen Lattimore, made a direct appeal to the politicians 'Give us peace and we will transform the fortunes of this corner of the world. Give us peace and we will make the Celtic Tiger look like a pussycat.' With Northern Ireland poised to strut its stuff on the West End stage, it will be up to Lloyd-Webber to set these great hopes to music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/nov/21/freedomofinformation.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-21T18:13:52Z","webTitle":"Scotland to take lead on freedom of information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/nov/21/freedomofinformation.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/nov/21/freedomofinformation.uk","fields":{"headline":"Scotland to take lead on freedom of information","bodyText":"Britain is set to have a two-tier freedom of information regime in which Scots will have more rights to inspect official documents than their English and Welsh compatriots, The Observer has learnt. The Scottish Executive will this week unveil a significantly stronger Freedom of Information Bill, just days after Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals were condemned as a sell-out by campaigners. The decision marks the first serious policy rift between the Westminster and Edinburgh administrations, and freedom of information campaigners quickly seized the opportunity to embarrass Straw over the contrast. Former Cabinet Office Minister David Clarke, who was sacked because his earlier draft Bill was too liberal, welcomed the Scottish proposals and hoped they would lead to further reform throughout the United Kingdom. The Campaign for Freedom of Information had fiercely criticised Straw for exempting all information which could be 'prejudicial to the effective conduct of public affairs' and which would 'be likely to inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views'. Under the terms of the Scottish Bill all discussions between Cabinet Ministers and their advisers will be open to scrutiny unless the Ministers or public bodies can publicly establish that disclosure would cause 'substantial harm' to vital interests. Under Straw's Bill, Ministers can simply ignore the recommendations of the Information Commissioner if they believe disclosure would 'prejudice' those interests. Scotland's greater openness was seized on by senior Liberal Democrats when they met in Edinburgh yesterday to plan their general election strategy with party leader Charles Kennedy. Senior party sources said the Scottish coalition government's decision was evidence of Liberal Democrats in power 'making a real difference'. Senior Liberal Democrats said the rift on open government was the first of many to come and policy differences between London and Edinburgh would be a key theme in the party's general election campaign. The party will focus on Scotland's policy departures from the Blair Government as evidence of how Labour can be improved in power by having Liberal Democrat partners. Senior sources said the government would not have departed from Straw's approach without sustained pressure from Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, Deputy First Minister. 'Wallace went into battle in the Scottish Cabinet and he won. 'He insisted that the commissioner had greater power than in England and that there would be fewer exemptions. In Scotland the commissioner will be able to instruct. Had it not been for Wallace, we would have followed England's lead.' Campaign for Freedom of Information director Maurice Frankel welcomed the Scottish proposals and said the greater rights of access for Scots would increase pressure for people living in England and Wales to be allowed similar information. David Clarke said: 'We had to move from being one of the backward countries in the world, into the vanguard. It will help to break the culture of secrecy which dominates our society.' He said the Scottish government's approach was based on a system used in New Zealand, where the Cabinet has yet to reject a commissioner's ruling. The Scottish Bill will be announced later this week and go out for consultation until March next year. It will not come into force for a year after Straw's Bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/nov/22/israel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-22T01:47:20Z","webTitle":"Jordan curbs Hamas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/22/israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/nov/22/israel","fields":{"headline":"Jordan curbs Hamas","bodyText":"King Abdullah II of Jordan last night delivered the coup de grâce to the activities of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, by exiling four top Hamas leaders to Qatar and pardoning 20 others. In a carefully choreographed move, Hamas offices will be kept closed and group members who remain in the kingdom will be barred from political activity. \"The case of Hamas is now considered closed after His Majesty the king decided to pardon all of the group's activists,\" the prime minister, Abdur-Ra'uf S Rawabdeh, said. Mr Rawabdeh said four of the leaders were sent to Qatar after consultations between King Abdullah and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Al Khalifa Al Thani. The prime minister declined to name the four, but officials said they were the Hamas political strategist Khalid Mashaal, the party spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh and the political bureau members Izzat Rushoq and Sami Khater. All four are Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin. Mr Rawabdeh stressed the four \"were neither being deported nor were their nationalities being withdrawn\". But when asked whether they would be allowed to return, he said: \"This is an issue which is open for dialogue.\" Jordan had come under intense pressure from the US, Israel and the Palestinians to restrain Hamas. King Abdullah has accused the Hamas leaders of using Jordanian soil for illegitimate purposes, but promised a \"political solution\" as a gesture of support for the Palestinians. The writing has been on the wall since August, when King Abdullah, in his boldest political move since he ascended the throne, authorised a crackdown on the Islamist group, which mounts periodic terrorist attacks against Israelis and fiercely opposes the peace process and Yasser Arafat's handling of it. Reports say that he acted at least in part at the request of the US, Israelis and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The requests have grown more insistent now that Israel and the PA have begun final status talks, theoretically to be completed by September next year. In breaking with the complaisance which his father, King Hussein, showed towards Hamas and its local ally, Jordan's powerful Muslim Brotherhood movement, Abdullah is also undoubtedly acting for his own, specifically Jordanian reasons. The Brotherhood's leading role in opposing the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty has long been a thorn in the government's side. One other Hamas leader, Muhammad Nazzal, is believed to be in hiding in Jordan, from where he has put out defiant statements, denying government claims that Hamas had been storing arms, or violating the terms of the 1993 agreement under which it was permitted to operate in Jordan. Government officials said last night that Mr Nazzal was included in yesterday's amnesty. The government accuses the arrested officials of undertaking illegal political activities in Jordan and affiliating with a banned group. Police have said they seized computer disks from the offices of the four exiled leaders that led them to caches of arms and explosives and to proof that the four had gathered sensitive security information. The crackdown ends the anomaly under which Jordan, of Israel's neighbours long the staunchest advocate of a peaceful settlement in the Middle East, furnished a platform for a group which opposes Israel's right to exist. Speaking to reporters in Palestinian-ruled Gaza, Ismail Abu Shanab, a senior Hamas leader, condemned the action.\"I consider the step as standing beside the enemy [Israel] against the Hamas movement,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/nov/24/derekbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-24T13:24:52Z","webTitle":"You go first, or I'm not playing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/24/derekbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/nov/24/derekbrown","fields":{"headline":"You go first, or I'm not playing","bodyText":"The Ulster Freedom Fighters have decided not to begin disarming until the Provisional IRA makes its intentions clear. The IRA wants to delay its arms handover until power-sharing begins. The Ulster Unionists are unhappy about power-sharing with republicans before they give up their guns. And so on and so forth, endlessly tiptoeing around the main issue and waiting for the other side to blink first. But what is the main issue? That is the question which should overshadow the continuing impasse. The most immediate objective is to end all paramilitary violence. Most people would say that has already happened. There are still punishment beatings, occasional executions and sundry thuggery, but by the grisly standards of the last 30 years, Ulster is effectively at peace. The second objective is for the main paramilitary groups to lay down their arms for good. That is the point of the so-called decommissioning process, and it is intimately bound up with the devolution of government to the power-sharing executive. Both go hand-in-hand, though the unionists and Sinn Fein are, even now, urging each other to make the first step. The danger now is that power-sharing and decommissioning are being seen as the be-all and end-all of the affair. Once Gerry Adams sits down next to David Trimble, the problem is over, right? Wrong. That is not the finishing line, but the starting point of a desperately overdue process of reconciliation. Republicans and other romantics see it as a strictly Irish matter of bringing the 32 counties to a new working relationship which will eventually result in unity. The more diehard unionists see it as a way of underlining Ulster's separate identity, permanently linked to the United Kingdom. Such formulae are not only mutually exclusive; they ignore the lessons of history, the glaring need of the moment, and the vital ingredient of future peace. That is nothing more or less than a fundamental reappraisal of the relationship between both our islands. Northern Ireland is not just a part of Britain where people happen to kill each other. Nor is it a part of an ancient indivisible Ireland, groaning under the yoke of discredited imperialism. It belongs to - not in the possessive sense, but rather as an integral part of - our shared culture. The nasty part of our joint British and Irish inheritance will, please God, soon be over. Now we have to get down to the real business of recognising and giving substance to the reality that what we have in common is much greater than that which separates us. In that context, the havering and dithering of the Mickey-Mouse private armies of Ulster is of little account. Nor is the ersatz nationalist outrage about the Royal Ulster Constabulary getting the George Cross, nor for that matter the foaming condemnation of Ian Paisley of just about everything. Useful links Northern Ireland: special report RUC award stuns Ulster Party tricks Michael Ashcroft, the Conservative treasurer and leading light of Belizean capitalism, is perfectly entitled as a registered overseas voter to donate money to the party. He pays his dues, like many other members, by standing order. The only teeny-weeny difference which marks out Ashcroft from the Tory herd is that his monthly sub is £83,000. The air is filled this morning with allegations of sleaze and counter-allegations of dirty tricks. The Conservative chairman, Michael Ancram, is calling for a police inquiry into how the details of Ashcroft's generosity were made public. Other high officials are frothing with rage about possible computer hackery and other disgraceful practices. Ashcroft is perfectly entitled to give his dosh to the party he loves, they say. The Labour party is keeping a gleeful silence. It doesn't have to say anything, because the notion of a million-quid-a-year donation from an offshore businessman is, in itself, eloquent.

It will also be responsible for the games on AOL subsidiaries such as CompuServe, Netscape's Netcenter, Mirabilis's ICQ messaging service, Digital City, and the AOL.com website. The deal is part of the Californian company's strategy to increase revenues from online gaming, which will include opening its own online games centre on the web at EA.com. EA has also taken over Kesmai Corporation, best known for its Starship Troopers and Air Warrior games. Kesmai, a subsidiary of multinational publisher News Corporation, has been a leading supplier of games to AOL's games channel. EA has also taken over PlayNation, which offers games on the web, and invested in quiz game company Bottle Rocket, to expand its online gaming portfolio. EA has also negotiated a non-exclusive agreement with Fox Interactive, News Corp's American TV network, to distribute online games through EA.com. Fox's properties include Aliens versus Predator, and the X-Files. David Gardner, president of EA Europe, said the moves were necessary to achieve \"critical mass\" in the online games market. \"We've been encouraged by the success of Ultima Online, which generates about $15m a year.\" Gardner said that all EA's development studios, including Bullfrog in Guildford, were now working on \"internet-centric products\". EA is also looking for further deals to increase European coverage. It plans to issue shares in its online gaming subsidiary then take it public, hoping to benefit from the inflated valuations usually given to internet stocks. AOL and News Corp's News America will acquire some of the new common shares. These aspects of the deal are subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. EA is a latecomer to online gaming, which started in the early 1980s with MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) at the University of Essex, followed by online adventures such as Shades on BT's Prestel viewdata system. However, most pioneering online games struggled commercially, so it's not too late. Gardner says: \"My sense is that by the time we launch in summer 2000 we'll be dead on time.\" (JS) A view to an overkill Well, what a coincidence, Mr Bond. In the very same week that The World Is Not Enough comes to the big screen and Tomorrow Never Dies arrives on the PlayStation, Electronic Arts has earned itself a licence to make a killing by signing up exclusive rights to publish 007 games for the next five years. The vodka-quaffing spy will star in a number of titles over all formats, with different developers specialising in each platform. Just don't raise an eyebrow if they're not all as good as Goldeneye. In a cheeky parody, New York-based publisher Take Two Interactive has signed a contract with New Line Cinema to develop software based on the Bond spoof Austin Powers. Various groovy games will be released across all platforms, including the Sony PlayStation 2. Sweet deal In a slightly less impressive coup, Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive has just secured the rights to publish games based on, um, M&amp;Ms sweets. The first title, due in autumn 2000, will be called The Lost Formulas. Gamers this side of the Atlantic, however, are unlikely to get a taste. The games will revolve around characters from the US TV ads. Peace treat Tomorrow, the Universe! Canadian developer Oceanus Communications is the latest company to make the leap into the improbably profitable world of online RPGs (role- playing games). As of next year Ultima Online, Ever-Quest and Asheron's Call will be sharing the multiplayer pie with Star Peace (above), a strategy, combat and role-playing title in which gamers can control not just one character but entire planetary empires. One quibble: unless they are targeting that notoriously small minority, the gaming pacifists, Oceanus might want to change the title... Snake's alive Snake Solid, star of the tactical hit that was Metal Gear Solid, is poised for a small screen comeback. The snarling special operative, who began life on the Nintendo, is reverting to his 2D, 8-bit self for Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel, on the Game Boy Color. Despite the platform's limitations, Konami promises to retain a number of the features that made MGS a success on the Sony PlayStation. Deep pockets Simon &amp; Schuster's spin-off spree continues with the release of yet another Star Trek title. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars will be a real-time strategy with space combat elements, set during the conflict airing in the UK - though it will be somewhat less timely when it appears in late 2000. It is the latest addition to an illogically long list of forthcoming Trek titles, which also includes first-person shooter Deep Space Nine: The Fallen, adventure game Star Trek: Hidden Evil, and space sim Klingon Academy.

The Tory guidelines which justify Michael Ashcroft's £1 million donation through the Belize Bank Trust Company will have to be rewritten to meet Jack Straw's draft bill which bans payments through trusts. Their present rules say: \"Donations can be accepted from any trust wherever incorporated if the receipts of the trust are substantially from those whose direct donations would be accepted.\" The Conservative rules also allow the party to take donations from countries outside the European Union provided they are run by British nationals or through British trusts. The new legislation will block these routes. The proposed law will no longer allow any foreign donations and restrict the party taking any cash from companies incorporated outside the United Kingdom unless they are carrying on the main part of their business here. A similar tightening up will apply to foreign-based partnerships and unincorporated businesses - even if run by British nationals whose main business interests are not in the UK. The onus will be on parties to check that the companies do most of their business in Britain and they will have 30 days to return the donation if there is any serious doubt that this is not the case. According to the Home Office, the acceptance by political parties of donations from trusts where it is not always possible to check where the money has come from will not be allowed, whether \"they are is in Belize or Barnsley\". A similar rule bans payments through blind trusts. On the surface this would appear to stop Mr Ashcroft using the present route to transfer money.

All these things are kitsch. But what do they have in common? Is there an essence of kitsch? Celeste Olalquiaga's extraordinary book promises to address such questions, locating the beginnings of kitsch in the mid-19th century, amid the Victorian crazes for decorative aquaria, reproduction mermaids, and artificial ruins in landscaped gardens. Kitsch objects are nearly always mass-produced, and so kitsch is painted as an inevitable consequence of the rise of industry and capital, representing a \"sensibility of loss\": inchoate melancholia for a lost or mythical past. Unfortunately Olalquiaga's grasp of the history of ideas is inadequate to her project. Before the mid-19th century, for example, she claims humans enjoyed \"an era where the perception of things was more direct\", and she is not just referring to the blurring effect of industrial smog. We are told that the 1800s saw the first appearance of a linear model of history, as opposed to the old tradition of cyclical time (that very change had already been dramatised centuries earlier, for example, in Mallory's Arthurian tales); and, even more bizarrely, that industrialisation swept away \"an organic model of evolution that lends credence to the belief in an ultimate connection between society and nature\", when of course it was evolution that was the novel and highly contentious idea of the time. Olalquiaga is a fabulously abysmal writer, but the very eye-popping incompetence of her style is unwittingly instructive. It is a maudlin, impotently debased version of high academia. Words like \"ontological\" are paraded with no regard to their actual meaning; there are many redundant superlatives (\"very graphic images\", \"highly marked by death\"); there is much sub-Lacanian guff about the \"optical unconscious\". There is lots of jargonised nonsense: objects in glass cases are said to be thereby protected from \"direct ocular contact\", as if Victorian men and women were in the habit of pressing their eyeballs onto things; the Crystal Palace was apparently \"the first mass-produced building\", as if hundreds of them were constructed; and Olalquiaga expresses surprise that fossils were long considered to be \"inanimate\" objects, as though she has seen one move. Perhaps she has: for even worse than any of this, even worse than her constant self-congratulation (she chirrups that \"I have extended the phrenologist's belief in 'organs of marvellousness' to the eyes\", to which the only sensible response is \"Why did you bother?\"), are the three interludes about her own kitsch experience: Rodney the hermit crab. He is dead, and lives in a glass sphere, but Olalquiaga somehow knows that \"a vital spark radiates from the fossilised hermit's eyes\"; and that \"Rodney cries silently\" because for him \"life is a concave dimension\" and he \"follows the rise and fall of feelings - those infinite nuances\". Olalquiaga notices that, with photography and mass-produced objects, \"imagistic representation\" had changed. But the change is not, as she thinks, that it became more \"accessible\" - for over the previous millennium, anyone could walk into a church and see the paintings - but that it became possessible: it could easily be privately owned. This, I think, is one of the key components of the kitsch attitude. It involves two stages of self-congratulation: first, I congratulate myself on having fine feelings, and yet I have nowhere to put them; so, secondly, I congratulate myself on deciding to invest my fine feelings in an object which I know to be cheap and artistically worthless. Aesthetic value is no longer socially negotiated but is exclusively mine to confer. My individual sensibility is all-powerful. Kitsch is Thatcherite aesthetics. And this is exactly Olalquiaga's attitude to the crab ornament, in the cack-handed finale of her book: \"In Rodney's eyes I have been able to gaze into myself as never before, and in this awareness he has resuscitated to a new way of life, for since the moment we met, Rodney lives in me.\" In this way, The Artificial Kingdom is not so much a discussion of kitsch as an example of it. If this is meant to be a joke, it is a very bad and expensive one. Kitsch is melancholic, like this book, because it usually involves a high degree of thoroughly misplaced effort (like the exquisite but vacuous ornamentation on a porcelain duck), and also because it is perfectly useless. But Olalquiaga's main theme, that kitsch crystallises a memory, is wrong, because unless you have had mushrooms for breakfast, you cannot remember what it is like to be a crab. On the contrary, the melancholy of kitsch arises from the destruction of memory: kitsch is deracinated, decontextualised and deliberately ripped from history. This is exactly the artistic attitude of the Nazis as they came to power, and Olalquiaga's book can only be so mimsily accepting of kitsch because she totally ignores this, its most demonic manifestation. The word \"kitsch\", from the German verkitschen (to make cheap) or kitschen (to collect junk from the gutters) was used from its inception in direct opposition to Kultur - kitsch was the degraded antithesis of high art. And as art became one battleground for propaganda, the Nazis denounced \"Jewish kitsch\" and condemned Weimar expressionism as \"degenerate\". Yet what the Nazis encouraged in its place was itself profoundly kitsch. Naturalist paintings of Aryan women as water-nymphs and strong men tilling the fields attempted to create a new tradition from scratch, and were purposely designed, with their naive pictorialism, to bypass the critical faculties and evoke the sort of \"feelings\" that Olalquiaga treasures in her hermit crab. The Nazis' appropriation of the ancient mystical symbol, the swastika, meanwhile, was also a kitsch gesture, disregarding the symbol's traditional context and concentrating purely on visual impact. How do we distinguish kitsch from the merely bad today? Objects which are kitsch may share certain family resemblances - excessive decoration, sentimental pictorialism, decontextualization, the melancholy of failed aspiration - but in the end, kitsch is fundamentally a moral attitude. The modern person who values something as kitsch is wallowing in defeat, giving up on the attempt to exercise artistic discrimination. At least you know where you are with crap. But this is nihilism, a slow rotting of the soul. The burbling celebration of The Artificial Kingdom, then, is not just silly but dangerous. As I was preparing to write this review, I looked up the details of a famous denunciation, Saul Friedlander's Reflections of Nazism: An Essay on Kitsch and Death. Scrolling down the Amazon web page, I came to the section where the site recommends other relevant purchases: \"1950s or Early 60s Pastel Color Clock. Works Too. (Current bid: $24.95)\". In that awful bathos, the money-grubbing stupidity of a computerised system that equates a book on the death camps with a tawdry piece of junk, lurks the very essence of kitsch itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/nov/27/martinwainwright1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-27T02:34:51Z","webTitle":"Cocaine gang told they face long jail terms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/27/martinwainwright1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/nov/27/martinwainwright1","fields":{"headline":"Cocaine gang told they face long jail terms","bodyText":"Leaders of one of the biggest cocaine-smuggling rings seen in Britain face long prison sentences after seven convictions at the end of a two-month trial.

The department of health also told hospital and community health trusts that they must get prior approval for recruitment of nurses from eastern Europe, Asia or any African state. The move follows a surge in overseas recruitment by the NHS to plug gaps in the nursing workforce, largely caused by excessive cuts in training places earlier this decade. Last year, a record number of more than 8,000 nurses from other countries applied to join the professional register in Britain to enable them to start work here. Almost 5,000 were registered, including 600 from South Africa. Since April, the rate of applications has almost tripled in what the registration body, the United Kingdom Central Council, has described as a \"phenomenal\" rise. The health department's intervention is the first of its kind. When South Africa protested in 1996 about the NHS poaching its doctors - a protest believed to have been made personally by Nelson Mandela, then South Africa president - trusts were urged to desist but the department made clear it was not applying formal restrictions This time, there is a clear cut ruling that \"in view of current nursing shortages abroad, recruitment from the Republic of South Africa or any Caribbean country should not be considered by an NHS employer\". The only permitted exceptions to this are where the home government consents to a nurse coming to Britain, as part of a recognised professional development programme, or where a foreign nurse makes an unsolicited application for a vacancy. A health department statement said: \"It is essential that when nurses are recruited from abroad, it is of benefit to the NHS's patients and staff and the recruit's home country.\" The new instruction has come in guidance on international recruitment, which also seeks to protect overseas nurses from exploitation in the NHS. The guidance stipulates minimum pay grades and says recruits should be advised of the advantages of joining a trade union. Trusts are told that some countries, such as the Philip pines, have surpluses of nurses and welcome recruitment by the NHS. Last year, almost 1,000 Philippino nurses applied to join the British register. There has also been a steep increase in applications from Germany. The department's initative was welcomed by nursing unions, which pointed out that the NHS in England alone was carrying about 15,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies.

All sorts of companies, from the Fortune 500 to medium-size firms and small businesses, are hiring chaplains, starting departmental meetings with prayer, permitting services, posting slogans and biblical quotations, and allowing employees to discuss religion. Although Christians dominate, the movement includes Muslims, Jews and others who believe faith deserves a place at work. Firms permitting or encouraging the combination of God and Mammon stretch from renowned names such as Ford, Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Xerox, and Intel, to Vicksburg Marine, the world's largest oil drill manufacturer and healthcare producer Tom's of Maine, as well as car dealerships, accountants, fast food firms, law offices, stores and banks. One non-profit agency, Marketplace Ministries of Dallas, Texas, sends 693 ministers of all denominations across America. They make 700 visits weekly, are on call 24 hours a day, and conduct weddings and funerals for 190 firms, covering 165,000 employees. The Fellowship for Companies for Christ International, a kind of Christian management consulting group that helps CEOs to form workplace prayer groups, says there are now 1,000 companies in the Atlanta-based fellowship, and 30 annual conferences, compared with only one five years ago. The FCCI group advises firms on applying 'biblical principles' such as rejecting bribery and encouraging more friendly worker-management relations. Books proliferate. Jesus, CEO , by Laurie Beth Jones, occupied the Business Week bestseller list for 13 months. She calls God 'the chairman of the board' and the disciples 'staff'. In the evangelical genre is God Owns My Business, by Stanley Tam. Meanwhile Tom Chappell, CEO of Tom's and a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, has written two - The Soul of a Business in 1993 and Managing Upside Down, a seven-step guide to 'doing good' at work, which came out last month. Harvard Divinity School Professor Laura Nash, a business ethicist and author of Believers in Business, describes the movement as 'exploding'. Lawyer Steven Green of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, agrees that mixing religious messages with management is 'definitely on the rise' but warns that 'one person's shared religion may be another person's harassment - we can expect to see court cases coming out of this'. Last April, Green went undercover to a seminar in Colorado sponsored by the evangelical Christian group Focus on the Family, at which 200 corporate lawyers gave advice on the legal problems of creating the 'Christian environment' sought by fundamentalists. 'The tenor of the meeting was to advise on just how far you can go without breaking the law,' said Green. The US has a constitutional guarantee of church and state separation that forbids prayer in schools, for instance, but it also supports religious freedom. Sometimes the two clash. In 1997 the Supreme Court repealed the three-year-old Religious Freedom Restoration Act - backed by Christians and meant to permit more religious activity. On the other hand, President Bill Clinton, a chapel-going Baptist, announced a Workplace Religion Policy to enable the faithful to pursue their religions at work. It permitted federal employees to have 'religious conversations' so long as they did not seek to convert and did not 'offend'. But overt religious expression at work has become a nuisance to non-believers. Ellen Johnson, president of the American Atheists Association, says she has noticed more complaints from workers who feel pressured to join in prayers and other religious activities. 'It can end up with the non-believer getting ostracised and fired, but it's almost impossible to prove in court,' she says. 'The Christians are piling on the pressure so much it's less difficult to come out of the closet as a homosexual in America today than to declare yourself an atheist or an agnostic. We believe that the Christians' real agenda is to worm their way into the workplace so they can proselytise. Converts have always been their priority.' The only scientific study so far on faith at work is a book published last month, A Spiritual Audit of Corporate America, by consultant Elizabeth Denton, and Professor Ian Mitroff of the University of Southern California Business School. Their survey found that 60 per cent had positive views of spirituality but not of organised religion, and 30 per cent were positive about both. This amounts to a staggering 90 per cent prepared to look favourably on some form of transcendent experience involving faith. The figures also illustrate a division in the movement. On one side are the overtly religious - usually evangelical conservatives. On the other are the spiritual seekers, mainly liberal New Agers with no specific religion who tend towards ill-defined 'feel-good' bromides. More firms feel at ease with the latter - they are less likely to preach or hector - but both bring strong pressure on non-participants, whether overtly or more subtly. Evidence suggests that spiritual programmes at work, and encouraging staff not to 'leave their religion at home' result in a happier workforce and improved production. One recent research project by international business consultancy McKinsey supports this, as do surveys by Gallup. Mitroff also found that employees at organisations that were considered 'more spiritual' were less fearful, less likely to compromise their principles, and more devoted. 'Spirituality could be the ultimate competitive advantage,' he says. But religion at work also presents difficulties. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reported a 30 per cent increase in discrimination complaints about religion, putting these just behind sexual harassment. Lewis Maltby, director of workplace rights at the American Civil Liberties Union, warns that evangelicals 'never ever' give up. 'It's been nearly 40 years since the Supreme Court ruled against prayers in schools, yet they're still trying to sneak it in,' he says. But corporate America has always been prone to management fads. In the Roaring Eighties it was obsessed with the Japanese. Will the new Christianisation trend be similarly short-lived? Harvard's Nash is not sure. For others the answer is an emphatic no. In her book Jesus, CEO, Jones presents the Nazarene as 'a leader who had three years to train only 12 people yet they turned the world upside down and did most of their best work after his death - when they were unsupervised. Isn't that model worth following?' It has certainly done well for her: she has lectured to 8,000 business leaders in America and abroad - most recently in Austria - and her five books were bestsellers, much to the chagrin of the seven religious publishers who rejected Jesus, CEO as a tasteless analogy. Finally, the workplace missionaries may produce unexpected results. Their message about employee-management relations contains buzz phrases about worker benefits such as empowerment, fulfilment, responsibility, ethical needs, support, joy in work, and being valued. In other words, be nice to the workers - not a sentiment US union leaders have experienced in recent years as hours lengthen, holidays shorten, incomes for all but upper management remain stationary and 'downsizing' produces dazzling leaps in Wall Street share prices. So wouldn't it be the supreme irony for the generally conservative evangelicals - and for a corporate America more used to deploying union-busting lawyers - if the spirituality movement stirred up worker militancy for better conditions? Kingdom come, my will be done An American-style religious workplace could be coming to Britain. RW Beckett Corporation of Ohio, the world's largest maker of oilburners for furnaces, is negotiating to acquire an unnamed British company and import its 'business with values' philosophy. Its president is John Beckett, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and devout Christian who says: 'My main mission in life is to know the will of God and to do it.' He wrote a popular book last year called Loving Monday: Succeeding in Business Without Selling Your Soul. His firm, founded by his father, is known for its liberal attitudes, such as allowing women more time off time after the birth of a baby than America's rather miserly post-natal leave rules allow. The book, with a preface by Jeffrey Coors, a member of the right-wing Adolph Coors beer family and head of a technology firm, has its own website. Beckett says: 'I believe the Bible applies to all of life, and there are ideas embedded in the scriptures that are very applicable to the workplace. Our customers, employees and suppliers can see we have an underlying integrity in this company. I look forward to experiencing the differences we may see in Britain, but honour, integrity and excellence at work are things that people everywhere respond to.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/1999/nov/28/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-28T02:46:21Z","webTitle":"Ann Summers to spice up Arabian nights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/nov/28/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/nov/28/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","fields":{"headline":"Ann Summers to spice up Arabian nights","bodyText":"You may have thought you were more likely to see camels on a British high street, but soon you will be able to find Ann Summers adult entertainment stores in Saudi Arabia. The move is part of a plan by Ann Summers owner Gold Group International to become a global player in the erotica industry. In addition to opening a string of stores in the desert kingdom, the company also plans 50 outlets in the US, 40 in Japan and several more in Egypt. Ann Summers has 25 stores in the UK, as well as an outlet in Dublin. The decision to launch in Saudi Arabia is bound to provoke controversy among the country's religious and political groups. When the company opened its Dublin store, the shop was picketed by demonstrators. David Gold, chairman of Gold Group International, which also owns half of the Sport newspaper and Birmingham City Football Club, wants to turn Ann Summers in to a global brand to take advantage of the Internet. 'The Internet will be good for those companies with strong brands. Ann Summers is well known through our franchise schemes,' said Gold, who has the company's logo emblazoned at the bottom of his swimming pool. The private company, run by Gold's daughter, Jacqueline, is negotiating to sell master franchises to the Ann Summers name in the US and Japan. Gold decided to open a chain in Saudi Arabia after he was approached by two Russian businessmen interested in buying a franchise licence. An Ann Summers spokeswoman said: 'It's not such a strange thing. At our Queensway store around 30 per cent of customers are from the Middle East.' Gold said he preferred to fund expansion plans by selling franchises rather than floating his company. 'I don't like the idea of being responsible to shareholders.

And comfort patients in hospital wards. Save lives in Mostar. Stand guard over Gateshead. We may no longer be a nation of believers, but we still want angels in our midst. In our increasingly prosaic world - where science and technology explain everything in rational terms, and time and money dictate our everyday commitments - we yearn for the divine spark, the invisible, untouchable and surreal. By depicting angels - or by depicting men and women as angelic - the most ardent atheist can acknowledge the divine without recognising the existence of God. 'Angel' is the one remnant of the religious vocabulary that, once the lingua franca , has now become a language foreign to most. Wing-free and without halo, latterday angels do not belong to the biblical tradition that places them in paradise, from whence, as God's divine army, they brandish swords of fire to protect his kingdom and his creation - mankind. They are no longer messengers from God - who stop Abraham's arm as he prepares to sacrifice his son, or tell a virgin Mary that she will conceive the son of God. Nor are they the unknown pilgrims who, as in medieval folk tales, tested ordinary mortals by seeking food and shelter, only to reveal themselves in all their splendour before the dazzled eyes of their unsuspecting hosts. No, today angels are not messengers, but THE message, living proof of another - better - way of life. Nurses who sacrifice themselves for their patients' welfare; aid workers who risk their lives for strangers; vicars, nuns and priests who live and work on sink estates: these are earthbound creatures whose goodness captures our collective imagination and admiration. It shames us. Conscious that their shining example will not be rewarded by a culture that prizes profit above virtue, the bottom line above the highest good - think only of a nurse's salary - we elevate these men and women to extraordinary status. And perhaps, too, we suspect that these mould-breakers, who ignore our market aims and confound our understanding of how to measure success, cannot be made of our too, too solid flesh. They must have something of the divine. Today, as in biblical times, the angel's presence is not always welcome. Indeed, it can prove deeply unsettling, a humbling reminder of our shortcomings. Which may explain why, in art as in life, we often cling to the medieval and Renaissance representation of the angel as childish. Raphael painted dimpled cherubs; we depict our own angels - say, the late Mother Teresa - as naive: adult virtue must be cloaked in childlike innocence. In this way, we can forgive angels for disregarding the rules we play by; and, too, dismiss them, and sideline their causes, as immature. We can console ourselves for our failures by claiming that these guileless creatures have no understanding of how difficult it is out there. We know better. Don't we? In the same way, we turn religious holy days that once served to nourish our spirit into childish festivities that gratify our consumer hunger. Christmas, the annual reminder to Christians all over the globe of God's gift to them - his son - and of their duty to him - being good and doing good - has become a toddler's fest of Barbies and Santa Claus, reindeers and chocolate. Religious ritual, like angels, must be shrunk to munchkin-sized bits we can feel in control of, and throw out with the gift wrap. As a Catholic, I was taught to pray to my guardian angel every night before going to sleep. He (for in my native Italian, the angel's gender was specific) stood beside me at all times, warding off evil temptations. Antony Gormley's enormous sculpture, Angel of the North, fulfils a similarly protective role for Gateshead: its wings stretch wide over the cityscape, its towering figure stands guard over the people. The sculpture acts as both blessing and admonishment to the community: it has become the collective father figure, a tower of strength in an insecure world of high unemployment, crime, broken families. Gormley's creation protects the many; but today there is no such thing as a personal guardian angel. We prize our individual freedom of choice above all else; we are at liberty to do good as well as evil, and anyone who looks over our shoulders, ready to judge our deeds is censorious (the contemporary equivalent of satanic). We are too conscious of Big Brother, too wary of being manipulated by politicians, spin doctors and public relations gurus to welcome a guardian of any description. Yet, if we don't want our angels watchful, we want to watch them; if they are not to stand beside us we want them to soar above us. Study the billboards advertising the latest movie star. These larger-than-life figures defy gravity and, like the nurse or the aid worker, beckon us towards a different and better world. But the movie star's celluloid world is not better for its virtue - indeed, it rarely celebrates virtue; rather, it is better for being glamorous and free of the constraints we most fear - age, ugliness, squalor. What is our obsession with celebrity if not an attempt to fashion an angel out of flesh and blood? From Gwyneth Paltrow to Leonardo di Caprio, we seek to invest household names with unfamiliar qualities: breathtaking looks, spinetingling talent, mind boggling presence. We long for these men and women to transcend our world, to prove themselves different from ordinary mortals. They must be bigger, better, bolder, more beautiful. We build their reputation accordingly, so that they may capture the glow of perfection. When they fall from their pedestal - Gwyneth Paltrow weeping at the Oscars, Julia Roberts showing her hairy armpits, Marlon Brando growing obese - we take offence: as would-be worshippers, these intimations of mortality upset us. If modern day icons are drawn from the secular world of catwalks, Hollywood and the box, photographers and moviemakers often borrow from religious art in their representation of these celebs. Olga Tobreluts's contribution to Heaven, the exhibition at the Liverpool Tate, is a case in point. \"Sacred figures\" depicts faces we know from the pages of Hello! - Kate Moss and Claudia Schiffer - in clever reworkings of world-famous paintings. The sacred is thus brought to earth and made acceptable, while the celebrity is invested with moral significance. In this imposture, both the famous and the heavenly hint at hidden powers. Everything is suggestion: what may be if you sleep with me, what may happen if you follow me. Fantasy construct or miracle-worker, star and angel promise a transformation; you will not be the same after this encounter. Plenty of films have played out this theme: from Heaven Can Wait to City of Angels, Hollywood has focused on the 'awakening' of a mortal - to God, the Good, or simply to him or herself. This moment of epiphany can take many forms: an unexpected meeting, an extraordinary coincidence, the kindness of strangers. In all cases, though, it results in a profound change, and marks a new beginning. For some, it will mean a new way of life; in Heaven Can Wait, for instance, Warren Beatty's meeting with the God-like James Mason turns the petulant millionaire football player into Mr Nice Guy. In the stories and novellas of the late Italo Calvino, the agent of change can be as ordinary as a fall of snow; its consequence is simply a new way of seeing the world. Calvino describes how snow falls upon a city, leaving everything magically transformed: a rubbish pile becomes an Alpine landscape, the school playground a winter garden. This not so divine intervention makes the quotidian suddenly extraordinarily beautiful and meaningful. Olga Tobreluts's Sacred Lives, Hollywood's angelic plots, and Calvino's magical realism urge us to look beyond the here and now. There is another dimension, they suggest. The popularity of these works points to our dissatisfaction with an existence we have stripped of the sacred. With its half human, half divine form, the angel links our material world to another, spiritual one - one where, today, humans fear to tread. Famous, caring, selfless, grand, innocent; our multi-faceted angels are as close to God as we dare go today. Perhaps tomorrow, we shall grow bolder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/nov/28/6","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-28T23:13:17Z","webTitle":"Christmas books part four","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/28/6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/nov/28/6","fields":{"headline":"Christmas books part four","bodyText":"Kathy Lette On the cusp of the new millennium, there are so many new social dilemmas facing the modern woman. I turned for advice to Debrett's Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners by John Morgan (Headline). Dating tips along the lines of brushing off unwanted advances by saying 'Please don't do that' and a strict admonishment not to 'expel liquid from any orifice in public, especially breast-feeding, which is \"revolting\"', contribute to making it the comic masterpiece of the year. William Fiennes Four books in one, Jonathan Weiner's Time, Love, Memory (Faber &amp; Faber) is at the same time a biography of the biologist, Seymour Benzer, a history of genetics and molecular biology, a thrilling essay on the connections between genes and behaviour, and a spry, graceful celebration of the excitements of science. Jonathan Raban's Passage to Juneau (Picador) is a literate and adventurous shanty, a salt-lipped song of the sea. And The Epic Poise: A Celebration of Ted Hughes edited by Nick Gammage (Faber &amp; Faber) is a rousing elegy, a tribute not just to Hughes but to the reach and possibilities of writing. Barbara Trapido Among non-fiction, I was both gripped and educated by Antony Beevor's Stalingrad (Allen Lane) and Francis Wheen's Karl Marx (4th Estate); also by Nicholas Crane's wonderful social history, ghettoised as travel writing, Two Degrees West (Viking). Cynthia Ozick's The Puttermesser Papers (Cape) and Howard Norman's The Museum Guard (4th Estate) were jewels among novels, and I admired J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace. Lynn Truss's Going Loco (Secker) was brilliant sitcom. Glen Baxter Babylonian cuisine and an inability to cope with seared aardvark bruschetta have long been failings of mine. Happily, this and hundreds more culinary delights can be addressed, flame-grilled and celebrated in Alan Davidson's utterly magnificent Oxford Companion to Food . Definitely my book of the year, possibly of the decade. Meanwhile, David Shrigley's The Beast is Near (Redstone Press) has been sending the entire Baxter household into paroxysms of laughter. It's like an episode of Blue Peter made by The Blair Witch Project directors. Kazuo Ishiguro In a profound meditation on how some of the greatest upheavals of this century touched ordinary lives, Colin Thubron's In Siberia (Cape), transcends even these large themes, ultimately to dwell on universal questions of mortality and the struggle to live meaningfully. I also much enjoyed Cressida Connolly's debut collection of stories, The Happiest Days (4th Estate), in which the world, as seen through the eyes of a series of emotionally deprived children is, for all its cruelties, filled with wonderful and dangerous beauty. Stephen Bayley I've always enjoyed big New York novels. Just as Jay McInerney captured the expensive, dissolute hedonism of the Eighties, so The Turn of the Century by Kurt Andersen has caught the mood of the late Nineties: more neurotic, more questing, more wired, more concerned and just as absurdly hilarious. This is a book about millennial hand-wringing and the snake oil de nos jours: getting rich with e-commerce. It's a novel whose context is the commercial battle between old media and new media: print versus electrons. The Turn of the Century has very funny characters; some real (including a mercilessly drawn Bill Gates), others more fantastical, but obviously based on obsessive scrutiny of what in New York passes as reality. It's full of knowledge and opinion unavailable elsewhere: not only is it a stonking good read of the old media narrative sort, it's a terrific primer on the Manhattan media business. Cressida Connolly The reason I write short stories is because they're my favourite thing to read. So my best books this year have all been collections of stories: Foreign Brides by the hilarious Elena Lappin (Picador), Lying in Bed by the rueful and witty Polly Sampson (Virago), and the unmissable Close Range by Annie Proulx (4th Estate). And I'd like to make a special mention of a young writer called Claire Keegan. Her first book of stories, Antarctica (Faber), are funny and dark and have a creepy quality which stays with you for weeks afterwards. Melvyn Bragg A new translation of Beowulf by Seamus Heaney (Faber &amp; Faber) brings an ancient world into our own. Almost Like a Whale: the Origin of the Species Updated (Doubleday) by Steve Jones, who does just that in an exhilarating ride through Darwinism yesterday and today. The Mighty Waltzer by Howard Jacobson (Cape) is the finest work I've read this year. And Where Did it all Go Right? (Richard Cohen) by Al Alvarez , a rare true book about a writer, his life, writing and writers. Simon Callow An account of his experience performing Via Dolorosa, David Hare's Acting Up (Faber) is one of the most fascinating things ever written on the subject of acting. He lays himself and his new profession bare in superb, probing, witty prose; the book is as much of an event as the play. Christopher Frayling The spare, perceptive and drily funny prose of Annie Proulx, in her 11 stories of today's wild west, Close Range, and especially 'Brokeback Mountain', for me blasts the Border trilogy of novels by Cormac McCarthy to kingdom come: no one could imagine that the horses in Proulx's west are pretty. Of the non-fiction, Ian Bradley's study of the cultural and musical background to Victorian hymns, Abide With Me (SCM Press), struck all sorts of deep chords. Owen Chase's Shipwreck of the Whaleship Essex (Lyons Press), the gripping sea story which helped to inspire Moby Dick, although first published in 1821, is this year's equivalent of The Perfect Storm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/nov/29/northernireland.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-29T02:10:42Z","webTitle":"Deadlock postponed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/29/northernireland.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/nov/29/northernireland.comment","fields":{"headline":"Deadlock postponed","bodyText":"David Trimble was saved on Saturday by two letters. One in his pocket and one in his deputy John Taylor's. Trimble's was a post-dated letter of resignation to be tendered next February if the IRA does not make progress on decommissioning. Taylor's was from the secretary of state, assuring him that if the IRA does not deliver, Sinn Fein will be held to account. Trimble emerged the hero of the hour, having thwarted the rejectionists who believed that his last minute abandonment of the party's cardinal principle of \"no guns, no government\" would spell his defeat. They were wrong, out-manoeuvred by a tactic that was breathtakingly simple and potentially explosive. Sinn Fein could take its seats in government - and as soon as this week - but on two months' probation. This would give the IRA time to show it was not only serious about decommissioning but had actively begun to do so. The conference over, Trimble then dramatically turned the tables on Sinn Fein with a 14-word soundbite: \"We've done our bit, Mr Adams, it's over to you. We've jumped. You follow.\" It was the last thing Mr Adams, at home with flu, wanted to hear. Republicans had hoped that the issue of decommissioning that has dogged the peace process since it was first raised by John Major in 1994, would go away once Sinn Fein entered government and was seen by its unionist partners to be actively working for peace. But this was not to be. Decommissioning, like the IRA, still looms large, with its potential to destroy Good Friday as great as ever. Most people applaud David Trimble for his political courage and see nothing wrong in setting the IRA a deadline for decommissioning. Surely unionists have given everything and republicans nothing? But the republican movement - the IRA and Sinn Fein - has made historic sacrifices too, but it cannot proclaim these compromises because it knows that would aggravate internal wounds which remain dangerously fresh. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness cannot stand on platforms and declare how the republican movement has signed up to a partitionist settlement, accepted the principle of Unionist consent, agreed to serve in a Stormont parliament and acquiesced in the removal of Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution that claim jurisdiction over the north. It would be political suicide. Their great, and often unrecognised, achievement is that they have brought the republican movement so far and presided over the abandonment of so many of its cardinal principles without tearing it apart. In the months and years of debate that attended the Provisionals' strategic change, decommissioning was the IRA's line in the sand. Everything was up for discussion to facilitate political change except handing over weapons. On the face of it, the reason was symbolic because it would signify surrender. The real reason was that it would split the IRA. Nevertheless, despite declarations that decommissioning would never happen in five million years \"in the short term\", privately senior Provisionals have indicated arrangements may be made when, but only when, Sinn Fein was in government and the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full. Under these circumstances, some decommissioning, in whatever form it may take would probably happen. It would not be the result of the precondition that had always been attached to it. This is what the leadership of the republican movement finds so unacceptable. By announcing that his party would reconvene next February to review progress on decommissioning before continuing to share power with Sinn Fein, David Trimble was again making decommissioning a precondition. Adams and McGuinness shudder at any refocusing on the issue that has the potential to destroy the republican movement and the peace process itself. Their concerns are intensified when they know, as British intelligence knows, that dissident republican groupings - the \"Real\" IRA and the Continuity IRA - are joining forces with dissidents from the INLA and some former Provisionals to form a formidable new armed grouping. That is why police forces throughout the United Kingdom are today on red alert. If the issue of decommissioning were to be forced in the next few months, the dissidents would almost certainly attract more defectors from the IRA. In the long days and nights in Belfast and London during which Senator Mitchell encouraged Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists to eyeball and talk to each other, Adams and McGuinness made Trimble aware of their difficulties and he, in turn, made them aware of his. Hence Sinn Fein's angry response yesterday at what they regard as a betrayal of faith and clear breach of the Good Friday Agreement. As political realists themselves, Adams and McGuinness know he did it to survive but know that in doing so he may have placed their own political survival and the survival of the peace process itself at risk.

What wars have been unleashed, what schisms provoked, what morals taught, by ergonomics? Jesus may have been a carpenter, but comfy furniture never figured in his sermons. People sat, people stood, people kneeled. That was it. Scour the New Testament till kingdom come and no reference will you find to efficient workstations that help posture. Times have changed. Rome has just welcomed a deluge of international companies bursting with hundreds of ideas and products to smooth the faithful's ride into the next millennium. Bishops, priests and nuns are streaming from the trade exhibition, ArtChiesa, kitted out with updated notions on what it is to be a Catholic. Confession may never be the same again. Once a dark, draughty box with a rickety stool and a door that wouldn't shut properly, the new confessional will have black leather seats, air conditioning, soft lighting and sound-proofing. A red light will show when it is occupied, a green light when it is vacant. A console panel will enable the priest, sunk in a luxuriously upholstered armchair, to regulate the temperature and level of sound-proofing. For excruciating sins he can dim the lighting. \"The best thing about it is this,\" says company spokesman Antonio, slamming shut the door and clambering into the penitent's side while I sit in the priest's side. \"I can confess to all sorts of stuff.\" He starts to shout. \"Forgive me Father, I robbed a bank. I hate my mother. I had impure thoughts about Lassie. I wore my sister's...\" And so on. He throws open the door. \"No one else could hear. In the past when you had a deaf priest and you had to shout people outside might hear everything.\" A snip at £4,000. Genuflex looked at the ageing clergy and flock and saw a fresh market for more comfortable furniture. Other products unveiled at the exhibition were the San Giovanni bench, which slopes at an angle that encourages good posture, and the divine love sanctuary, a bench that resembles a castle. A knot of priests clusters around an altar. The salesman gets to the point. \"Prob lems recruiting altar boys? Not any more. Here we've got an extendible table that flips just when you need to get the chalice.\" The potential clients murmur doubtfully. Jesus rampaged through a temple whipping money-lenders, but the Vatican has no problem with ArtChiesa, which fills three pavilions at an exhibition hall in Eur, a southern suburb built by Mussolini. \"The church in Italy has plenty of money for this type of stuff,\" says the spokesman for Harmonia, which makes microphones for pulpits. He is right. Beyond the Turin shroud face masks, the hip-high sound systems and the three-in-one incense, a tour of the exhibits reveals a church in want not of money but staff. I n the corner stands a mighty bell suspended from a mysterious black box: a motorised, computer-controlled instrument that lets the priest unleash bongs at the flick of a switch - he no longer has humans to toll. Two stands further on, we reach a series of what look like medieval torture racks: 10ft-high wooden contraptions with 60 metal spikes at the base, netting in the centre and wires circling the top. They are pigeon repellers. Plug them in and the wires deliver a nasty shock. Salesmen hastily explain that the devices are non-fatal. But not so long ago, when staff were available to shoo pigeons away or clean up the mess, there was less need for such devices. Most of the stands display knick-knacks. Ceramic holders for holy water, porcelain statues of the Madonna, washable rosary beads. Maybe that explains the enduring mystery of why Anglicans sing better: they have less to play with. • Charlotte Raven is away"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theguardian/1999/nov/30/features11.g22","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-30T01:35:08Z","webTitle":"'I've got more to say than Swampy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/nov/30/features11.g22","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/nov/30/features11.g22","fields":{"headline":"'I've got more to say than Swampy'","bodyText":"Maria Tugwell pushes her bicycle into a country lane and then on to a forest path. Her daughter, 15-year-old Christiana, steps out from one of the tarpaulin tents that lie among the trees. Her narrow shoulders fail to stop her cardigan slipping off. Her hair is matted. She may be tired, her mother says. The last few days have been busy. Last week Christiana went to the high court to stop 60 luxury houses being built on 11 acres of wood and scrubland where local people walk, pick blackberries and let their children run wild near her home in Hockley, Essex. She lost. Her solicitor has applied for permission to appeal. Tugwell intends to carry on living with other activists in the protest camp she set up this summer. What began as a Famous Five-style adventure now draws veterans from the Newbury bypass and Manchester airport protests. A tunnel system has been dug and will be occupied if an eviction order is served. Although her mother is against the development, she worries about her daughter being in an underground tunnel, hounded like a rabbit in its warren.\"I didn't want her to go camping, but she insisted.\" The last bit is easy to believe. Sitting on an old settee in the camp's communal area, she is queen of her self-made kingdom. \"If I see that there are things going wrong I don't see any option but to try and put them right,\" she says. \"I'm not interested in the legal grounds for the development: we may not have a legal leg to stand on. Our greatest defence, the moral argument, doesn't stand up in court, which is why we're losing.\" The developers, Countryside Residential, don't expect resistance, she says. The camp is backed by local people, many of whom bring food, clothes and the offer of a hot bath. \"So to find us sitting here saying 'Come and get us if you think you're good enough' is bad for the developers' morale. They don't want people to associate posh houses with the destruction of woodland.\" She has swotted up on land law, she says: \"I knew I'd need it.\" Tugwell says that Rochford district council has not consulted local people over the development. \"The adult members of the community voted the council in and now they're being ignored. It's too late now for letter-writing.\" So when she is old enough, will she vote? \"I don't think voting makes any difference. The decisions are made by people scuttling around in corridors. Look back on something like Yes, Minister, and you see that it's still valid.\" She is not new to David and Goliath-style tussles. Along with other activists, she filled bin-liners with litter and dumped them in a McDonald's restaurant when she was nine. The suffragettes are the inspiration for her direct action. \"I did lots of projects on them - very courageous indeed,\" she says. She also studied Martin Luther King and Gandhi. Is there no one alive she aspires to be? \"We only know about TV presenters and pop stars. Genuine people don't get famous,\" she says. \"A 15-year-old young woman is supposed to be into the Spice Girls, Eternal, Steps and Boyzone, pink and ponies. Pink is a foul colour. And those bands don't produce anything that counts as music. They are plastic.\" Saturday in Southend, she says, is a \"model parade - the make-up, mini-skirt thing covers your true self. Some teenagers get very stressed thinking they have to keep up.\" When she didn't \"keep up\", she paid for it. She was bullied at her local secondary school. Was this because she would not conform? \"Ask them why,\" she says. \"I mean, why do some people become really popular, lead the class and be the golden girls and some people just don't? I got on with the teachers - I just don't get on with the peers.\" Her mother decided to educate her at home: \"It stopped me being beaten up every day.\" At 14 she had three GCSEs and A-level English. It is hard to imagine that this quick-witted young woman was ever pushed around. It is only when her mother tries to interrupt that she shows her age. \"All right, mum,\" she tuts, rolling her eyes, \"I was going to say that.\" In camp she affectionately bosses around male activists 10 years her senior. They are her greatest inspiration, she says, teaching her how to build tunnels, live outdoors, build benders, make woodburners. So does she find everyone else politically apathetic? \"Not only apathetic but pathetic,\" she says. \"They sit on their backsides going: 'I'll vote for the Labour party this time'.\" Matt, a 23-year-old fellow protester, chips in: \"With their ethical foreign policy.\" She repeats the phrase with a sneer \"It does make me a tiny bit sick. I'm 15 and I've managed to set up something like this,\" she throws her hands towards the camp. \"There are people with a lot more money and time on their hands who could do so much more than I have.\" But surely her age and lack of financial responsibility are precisely why she can just up and live in a forest. \"I do appreciate that. When you have a mortgage and a family it's a different ball game. You're answerable to your kids, spouse, bank, taxman. But those people have cars, access to faxes and computers, which can help with publicity.\" Publicity is something she is having to learn about. In one hour several national newspapers, the local paper and television call the camp mobile. One Sunday tabloid wants to print her baby pictures. \"I'm going to ask for £1,000 for the campaign,\" she says. She asks another paper for a donation for speaking to them. \"When local television came around it was very David Attenborough,\" she says. \"Like finding the lesser-spotted eco-warrior in her natural environment. Christianus Maximus.\" Scathing about the term \"eco-warrior\" and the cliches it brings, she is waiting for the \"backlash\" to start. \"Like it did with Swampy,\" she says. \"He was crucified. But then I have an awful lot more to say for myself than Swampy ever did. In case you haven't noticed, I've got the gift of the gab.\" The previous day she was in London for a hospital check-up. She has recently had an operation for an inherited form of thyroid cancer which caused her father's death two years ago. On the underground she realised that she was being recognised. Every 15 minutes a stranger would stop her to ask if she was \"that eco-warrior\". \"That terrified the hell out of me. I wanted to run.\" Her gab stops and she looks confused. \"I don't appear to be stopping the development. I just appear to be getting famous. That wasn't on my list.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/nov/30/thatcher","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-30T01:35:18Z","webTitle":"Politics of failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/nov/30/thatcher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/nov/30/thatcher","fields":{"headline":"Politics of failure","bodyText":"William Hague has welcomed the result of the by-election in Kensington and Chelsea as a turning point in the fortunes of his party. In fact Mr Portillo failed to persuade many Tories to turn out to vote. Nevertheless, he held the seat, and planted an ominous question mark over Hague's future. For most practical purposes, a new contest for the party leadership has already begun. But Michael Portillo is no more capable than William Hague of delivering the Tories from their ruinous past. In the longer perspective of history, his victory in Kensington and Chelsea is likely to go down as just another day in the death of the Conservative party. The cluster of allegations that surfaced last week have renewed, perhaps more strongly than before, the public perception that when they were in power the Conservatives tolerated sleaze in government. At the same time, last week's furore has turned a harsh light on the pitiful, disoriented remnant the Tories have become. The Conservative party has lost any realistic grasp of the nature and scale of its problems. Whatever the truth or otherwise of claims about the party's sources of funding in recent years, it is safe to assume that its dependency on rich donors, some of them foreign, goes back a long way. A party that understood the need to make a break with the past would confront the mistakes that led to its near bankruptcy, even if that meant worsening its financial problems in the short run. Instead, the party leadership has fallen back on paranoid accusations of dirty tricks. Its reaction expresses a denial of reality that runs right through Tory thinking. When paranoia appears in politics it is usually a protest against insignificance. It is easier to imagine that you are being plotted against than to face the fact that you have ceased to matter. It is the Tory policy on Europe that shows most clearly the party's weakening grip on reality. Mr Hague has positioned the Tories on the nationalist outer fringes of Euroscepticism partly because it enables him better to control his party and partly because it gives it a unique selling point. But by doing so he has created in the jargon of marketing a product whose potential market is an English minority. Whatever Mr Hague says, the logic of his stance on Britain's relations with the European Union - and the source of its popularity in much of his party - is withdrawal. It is pointless for a government to attempt a fundamental renegotiation of our relations with the EU unless it has a credible sanction in hand - and that can only be withdrawal. But the likely practical result of a Tory government making such a threat would be the break-up of the United Kingdom. How would Scottish voters view the prospect of being taken out of the EU? How would the Welsh? And what impact would the prospect of British withdrawal from the EU have on the fragile peace that is being patiently brokered in Northern Ireland? The Tories' failure over Europe is partly political. William Hague has given priority to party management and electoral tactics rather than coherence in policy. But Hague's stance on Europe also embodies an intellectual failure. The Tories have not noticed that when sovereignties are shared and fuzzy, as they are to some extent in the European Union today, nationalist movements cease to be separatist. Why have the Catalans and the Welsh put the old demand for national independence on one side? Why has it ceased to be a live issue in Scotland? Because in the context of European institutions the meaning of self-government has changed. It no longer stands for sovereign statehood, but rather for effective devolution of power. Yet the Tory leadership seems not to realise that threatening British withdrawal from Europe is just about the only thing that can revive separatism in Scotland. Has it not understood the absurdity of a policy that could leave England detached not only from the rest of Europe but also from the rest of Britain? Without knowing what they were doing, the Tories have redefined themselves as the party of English nationalism. This is the Conservative party that Michael Portillo looks set to take over. There can be little doubt that if he does become leader Mr Portillo will seek to reinvent himself again - perhaps as a born-again pro European after the Tories are defeated in a euro referendum. But the party he will inherit will be a neo-Powellite sect whose constituency, even in England, is an alienated minority. Mr Portillo could end up leader of a party more tightly tethered to the past than David Trimble's Unionists. It was Enoch Powell who said that all political careers end in failure. The gloomy Tory sage may have been more prophetic than he knew. Last week's result in Kensington and Chelsea was not a turning point in the fortunes of the Tory party but more probably another phase in its collapse. If he becomes Tory leader, Michael Portillo will have reversed one of the most humiliating defeats in British politics. But he may go on to discover that high political ambition can be more cruelly mocked when it succeeds than when it is thwarted by defeat.

In the olden, golden days before lush materialism set in, people were happier. As we gathered round the hearth (coal-fired, leading to bronchial infections and pea-soupers - but that is to spoil the story) we may have been poor but we were honest. It is a short step from here to a broadside against the decline of community spirit, divorce, jobs for women, rights for children and other attributes of civilised life at century's end. Two studies out this week have this tinge of regret about them. One dislikes coke and crisps and praises the restricted bread, milk and veg diet of children 50 years ago. It did their bones and bowels good. But subsequent changes in behaviour and science slashed childhood morbidity and vastly improved dental hygiene - and who is to regret that? What was one of the first items Clement Attlee's socialists strove to de-ration? Answer: sweets. The other study bemoans modern mobility. Wheels have wrested us from our native heath, planting us for hours in cars to get fat, lazy and selfish. The figures are arresting. From five miles a day in 1950, the average Briton now journeys 28 miles daily. But there never was a pristine state of cosy car-less neighbourliness. Besides, the bare facts of distance travelled say little about the qualities of modern life. Sociologists have redone Wilmott and Young's East End studies: \"community\" is alive and well. People keep in touch more rather than less, thanks to modern telecoms - and car journeys to visit mum and dad. Car travel is increasingly vocal. People talk to each other on the go, hands-free or otherwise. Car drivers know as well as John Prescott their paradoxical fate. The more of them there are, the slower they go.

The Cold War made people edgy ('Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?') and it seemed quite possible that we might wake up one morning and find that we were 'out of time'. But now? Well, 'it's here and I like it,' as Will Smith says in his greeting card to the new year 'Will 2K'. There isn't much anxiety in this song, it's time to celebrate. What exactly? The 'Willennium', he helpfully suggests, 'the party of a lifetime... resolution: get the money'. Future historians looking for evidence of the 'terrors' of the year 2000 aren't going to get much mileage out of Will Smith, or indeed any other area of popular culture. The Western world is unthreatened, some people are enjoying great prosperity, and governments are more popular than at any time in living memory. The End has become a marketing opportunity; it sells anything, even (in the TV ads) Uncle Ben's rice. Meanwhile, over in academia Prince is still the party tape of choice. Publishing 'like it's 1999' may be variously interpreted, but whatever the resulting book is called, the assumption is the same: the end of the millennium is inextricably linked with apocalypse, the end of the world, and the messianic fanatics who seek to bring it about. And so although these three books are definably different, the thinking behind them is remarkably uniform. It is perhaps best illustrated by the circumstances behind Eugen Weber's book. Invited by the University of Toronto to deliver a special lecture about fins de siècle, he soon discovered that there was not much to say. Centuries were an early modern invention, and it was only the end of the 19th that had attracted any special attention. Undeterred by his findings (or lack of them) he nevertheless concluded that there is 'a widespread demotic sense that the end of a calendric term somehow coincides with the end of an era, a culture, a civilisation'. Believing that 'apocalypse is about the world's progress to an appointed end,' he fell back on the idea of talking about apocalypse instead. The result is an engaging and fast-moving survey, but the easy slide from fin de siècle to apocalypse is one that deserves closer examination. The idea that a temporal end, however arbitrary, weights the time preceding it with a significance it might not otherwise possess is given its fullest expression in Frank Kermode's The Sense of an Ending. In this, perhaps his most influential book, Kermode argued that fiction, like apocalypse, gives shape to time by translating the relentless tick-tick-tick of bare chronicity into the tick-tock of a meaningful plot. By listening for the next tick as a tock, as the end of something that preceded it rather than the next in a meaningless and interminable succession, we invest time with shape and significance. And if tock is a tiny apocalypse, the end of a millennium ought to be a very big one. Like much of Kermode's writing, The Sense of an Ending is both extraordinarily lucid and strangely elusive. When I read it again recently, it often seemed like an extended response to a work to which it nowhere adverts - Eliot's Four Quartets. This curious palimpsest was perhaps motivated by Kermode's attempt to distance himself from Eliot while accepting the terms within which Eliot had formulated the question of time in 'Burnt Norton'. Eliot's premise is that 'If all time is eternally present/All time is unredeemable.' Humanity needs some kind of redemption from time, but, paradoxically, 'Only through time time is conquered.' This juxtaposition of chronological time and redemptive time, which critics in the Fifties were already interpreting in terms of the opposition between mere flux and the Christian kairos, is also the basis of Kermode's distinction between the 'reality' of chronos (tick-tick) and a 'time-redeeming' kairos (tick-tock). And just as Eliot looked to the coexistence of 'Time past and time future/What might have been and what has been' in one end in which 'all is always now,' so, according to Kermode, it is in the 'concord of past, present and future . . . in the present of things past, the present of things present, and the present of things future' that such redemption becomes possible. However, Kermode was doing more than giving covert expression to an Eliotic soteriology: he was also democratising it. According to Eliot in 'Little Gidding', 'A people without history/Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern/Of timeless moments'. Substitute 'fiction' for 'history' and you have Kermode's theory in a nutshell, but that substitution is the crux of the matter. His argument with Eliot, both in The Sense of an Ending and, far more explicitly, in his T.S. Eliot Memorial Lectures, The Classic, is that by identifying redemption with history, and history with a tradition that is 'timeless and undesiring', Eliot was offering salvation only to an elect. With his 'persistent nostalgia for closed, immobile hierarchical societies', Eliot was, as Kermode put it, 'a poet... of empire'. His idea of tradition was the continuity of empire, the timeless moments when 'History is now and England.' By suggesting that 'in every plot there is an escape from chronicity,' Kermode invested fiction with the time-redeeming potential Eliot found only in tradition. The effect was to liberate redemption from the past. As many others have done, Kermode turned to apocalyptic in the attempt to counterbalance the overbearing weight of history. But in Eliot's case, identification with tradition had itself been an attempt to escape from the apocalypse of The Waste Land. As Kermode noted in an essay written at the same time as The Sense of an Ending, the 'imperialistic Eliot' is the poet of the Roman 'urbs aeterna... the other side of this city is the Babylon of Apocalypse'. Eliot knows that 'behind the temporal disaster of Babylon... the timeless pattern of the eternal city must survive'; Kermode has less confidence. Instead, he finds within Eliot's apocalypse the redemptive pattern the poet sought outside it. Complaining that we think of The Waste Land 'as an image of imperial catastrophe, of the disaster and not of the pattern', Kermode argues that Eliot's apocalypse redeems the time more effectively than The Four Quartets. For Kermode, apocalypses are not something we need to be saved from, they are the way we save ourselves. The equation of ending, apocalypse and fiction is founded on the assumption that 'an end will bestow upon the whole duration and meaning.' However it is not altogether clear that endings do what Kermode claims. In one of the Conversations about the End of Time (in which he fields questions like 'Has \"dark\" matter anything to do with antimatter?' and 'Do you practise t'ai chi with someone Chinese?') the playwright Jean-Claude Carrihre suggests that human time is not made out of chronological time but is, as in Ecclesiastes, 'a time for this and a time for that'. Such times are defined by their purpose rather than their ending, and of the two it is the former which is usually the more productive of meaning. The assumption that our experience of time is of chronos and that we need fictions to shape it into kairos seems, like the epistemological assumption that we experience bare sensations which we have to organise into meaningful shapes and sounds, to go too much against the grain of what we know about the world. It takes an effort to experience bare chronicity; we experience kairos by default. If this is so, then it is questionable whether temporal termini really have the significance Kermode attributes to them. Although he articulates the opposition of empire and apocalypse in terms of eternity and eschatology, Kermode suggests that timelessness and ending are equally capable of redeeming us from time. Quite apart from the question of whether the sense of an ending saves us from, rather than consigns us to, mere chronicity, Kermode's assumption that the apocalyptic simply appropriates the benefits of empire is questionable. We can perhaps get a better understanding of how apocalyptic differs from tradition by comparing the ways in which apocalyptic and imperial writers use similar material. In this respect, an illuminating comparison is provided by Daniel (the first canonical apocalypse) and Plato (whose vision of a state founded on a timeless heavenly pattern is, in Kermode's sense, imperial), for both make use of the same myth. No one knows exactly where the myth of the ages came from, but it is of ancient origin and is found in Zoroastrian sources and in Hesiod. In Zoroaster's version there are four successive ages, each of a thousand years: the first of gold, the second of silver, the third of steel, and the last of iron alloy. Each age represents a decline on the previous one, and the same is true of Hesiod's sequence, which goes from gold, to silver, to bronze, to iron save that there is an unnamed fourth age, interspersed between the bronze and the iron ages, which is the age of the heroes of Troy and Thebes whose achievements place them above both the preceding and the succeeding periods. In the Republic Plato takes over this sequence (excepting the heroic age) and arranges it synchronically in a foundation myth designed to ensure the stability of the state. According to this version, when god fashioned men he put gold in the composition of the Guardians, silver in the Auxiliaries, and iron and bronze in the farmers and other workers. Their first and most important commandment to the Guardians was that they should ensure that there was no mismatch between the metallic composition of an individual and the social role they occupied. Children born to the Guardians who have other metals in place of gold must be demoted, children of other classes who have higher metals in their make-up promoted accordingly, the justification for this being a supposed prophecy that the state will be ruined when it has Guardians of silver or bronze. Although the myth is a fiction which the inhabitants of the state must be duped into believing, Plato appears to accept a version of it himself. For when he comes to describe the sequence of political forms through which the ideal society might degenerate, he attributes degeneration to just such a confusion of metals. When the Guardians fail to educate the next generation properly, their successors will be unable to discern the metals from which the different classes are made. In consequence, they will become confused, and 'when iron and silver or bronze and gold are mixed an inconsistent and uneven material is produced, whose irregularities, wherever they occur, must engender war and hatred.' This strife produces timocracy, which degenerates into oligarchy, which, in turn, slides into democracy and from there into tyranny. In Plato's account, the successive forms of political degeneration are not explicitly identified with the preponderance of any particular metal. Nevertheless it is easy to see that there is a broad homology between the five successive forms of government, the four types of metal supposedly found within the souls of various social groups, and the threefold division of the individual soul into its rational, spirited and appetitive components. The ideal state is governed rationally by the Guardians with gold in the souls; in timocracy it is the spirited part, associated with silver and the Auxiliaries, that predominates; in oligarchy, democracy and tyranny, the appetitive parts of the soul, the bronze and iron of the money-making classes, take control, all that changes between one stage and the next being the balance between desires that are necessary and unnecessary, honourable and base. In effect, what Plato describes is a succession of governments characterised by the same metals as Hesiod's sequence of the ages. But he also seeks to account for this mythic sequence in human terms. The debasement and mixing of metals becomes a metaphor for forms of social and psychological degeneration brought about through the dissolution of class divisions and the overturning of the hierarchy of the soul. Daniel's version of the myth has many similar features. In Nebuchadnezzar's dream, recalled for him by the prophet Daniel, the Babylonian King sees a giant image with a head made of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of iron and clay. Here is not only the same sequence of metals as in Hesiod and Plato, but, with the localisation of the metals to different parts of the body, a parallel with Plato's anatomy of the soul in the Timaeus which places reason in the head, spirit above the midriff and appetite below. If Plato had been among the wizards and sorcerers called in to interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream, he would have managed pretty well. He, too, would have been able to tell the King that the sequence of metals represented a degenerative historical sequence of governments, and he would also have understood the principle embodied in the idea of iron mixed with clay as one of the incompatible mixture of opposites. But Plato would have been surprised by what happened next: a stone smashes the image in pieces and then enlarges to fill the whole earth. This event, which Daniel interprets as the establishment of God's kingdom on earth at the end of the process of degeneration, has no parallel in Plato, or in later classical visions of a new golden age. The differences between Daniel and Plato are worth considering, for they highlight the difference between the apocalyptic and the imperial approaches to history. What is shared between the two is a description of the process of degeneration in terms of debasement and mixture. Even Daniel's own dream, which recapitulates the sequence of the four kingdoms through the symbols of four beasts beginning with a lion with the mind of a man and ending with a terrible beast with ten horns, iron teeth and bronze claws, would probably have made sense to Plato. He describes the three parts of the soul as a man, a lion and a many-headed beast, and so the descent from rational to appetite-driven forms of society could easily have been pictured in a similar fashion. But what is fundamentally different is that whereas Plato, like Nebuchadnezzar, who makes a golden statue in an effort to perpetuate his own kingdom of gold, can think only of the need to preserve the golden age and hold back the process of degeneration, Daniel, whose companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refuse to worship the golden image and are thrown into the fiery furnace, is not committed to the golden age or to resisting change. Here, the imperial and the apocalyptic responses to history diverge. Both are working with an understanding of history that presupposes a similar pattern of degeneration, but where the empire tries to hold on, if only through memory, to the golden age, apocalypse accepts the whole process of degeneration and mixture as inevitable. The fifth kingdom, the stone that smashes the image, not only mixes up all the different metals in the process: it is composed of a substance even less valuable than the iron which preceded it. It is no accident that millenarians who, like the Fifth Monarchy Men of the English Revolution, identify themselves with this kingdom are rarely supporters of established social traditions. Because he gives a description of the social and psychological changes that effect the degeneration of the metals and which culminate in the rule of the many-headed appetitive beast, Plato also unwittingly provides the first sociological account of apocalypse. And in Plato's portrayal of democracy, we get a clear picture of what a society ruled by the beast would be like. It is one in which all hierarchies are dissolved. Parents and children stand on an equal footing, there is no distinction between citizens and foreigners, and complete equality between the sexes; slaves have the same freedom as their masters, and even domestic animals acquire the same sort of rights as their owners. If this sounds familiar, we can perhaps begin to understand what it is about late modernity that strikes some people as apocalyptic. Eliot, as he acknowledged in a radio interview in 1958, found Plato's account of democracy to be a recognisable description of 20th-century egalitarianism with 'its mediocrity, its reduction of human beings to a mass'. And it was in response to this apocalypse that he retreated to his imperial fantasy of a hierarchically stratified society, divided along the lines of Plato's ideal state. Among the features that Eliot identified as essential components of tradition in After Strange Gods was taboo, a word whose contemporary use 'in an exclusively derogatory sense' he considered 'a curiosity of some significance'. One of the primary functions of taboo is, as many anthropologists have argued, to prevent mixture and the confusion of kinds. It serves to keep things apart or in their place. But whereas traditional societies are good at maintaining taboos, the world seen in apocalyptic visions is one in which taboos are broken and chaos reigns. Those inspired by apocalyptic do not necessarily take a negative view of this. For example, one of the strangest apocalypses in the New Testament (and therefore not accepted as such by all Biblical scholars) is Peter's vision in Acts. Falling into a trance on the roof of a house, Peter sees the sky open up and a great sheet being lowered down. In it are animals of every possible sort, 'whatever walks or crawls or flies'. A voice commands Peter to kill and eat. Peter replies that he has never eaten unclean meat. The voice replies: 'It is not for you to call profane what God counts clean.' Without the kosher mentality, it is difficult to capture the horror of this invitation. (Perhaps the nearest contemporary equivalent would be seeing a shopping basket full of genetically modified vegetables being lowered out of the sky. An anthropologist might say that the principle behind the taboo, the avoidance of mixed kinds, was the same in both cases.) Nevertheless, it is easy to see how the vision fits into the apocalyptic pattern. Peter immediately grasps that God has instructed him to break the taboo against associating with Gentiles, and so he baptises the Roman centurion Cornelius, the first Gentile convert to the emerging Jewish sect of Christianity. From the point of view of a traditionalist, this failure to discriminate between Jew and Gentile is the start of the process of degeneration, the equivalent of the failure to distinguish between the metals in Plato's republic, and the induction of a silver soul into the ranks of the Guardians. But what the story of Peter's vision shows is that the action which, from the point of view of tradition, involves the dissolution of hierarchy and order, is, from another perspective, an act of recognition that fosters a more open and egalitarian community. The crucial difference between apocalypse and empire, it is beginning to emerge, may lie not in the opposition between eternity and ending, but in areas that are far more politically sensitive. We know how Plato's democratic apocalypse came about in modernity, through the recognition and emancipation of all sorts of disadvantaged groups - slaves, women, children and so on. And we know too how traditionalists have sought to maintain the distinctions, hierarchies and taboos that these emancipations systematically eroded. In this context it is clear that Eliot's anti-semitism, his belief that a rooted, traditional society could not accommodate 'too many free-thinking Jews' is very much part of his negative reaction to apocalypse. Apocalypse almost invariably describes racial mixture - Plato's democracy does not discriminate between citizen and foreigner, Daniel's feet of iron and clay symbolise racial intermarriage - and according to Eliot, it is by being preserved from an 'influx of foreign populations' that tradition survives. The complex relationship between Jewish and Christian identities in the history of apocalyptic interpretation is at the heart of Popkin and Katz's Messianic Revolution. Just as Jewish apocalypses envision that Jews will get mixed up with Gentiles, Christian interpreters often came to believe that the Jews, long excluded from divine favour, would once again play a role in salvation history. As Weber notes, if Andrew Marvell's coy mistress were to refuse 'till the conversion of the Jews' she would be holding out until the end of time, not because the Jews will never convert but because it is then that their conversion will take place. However, some Christians preferred to assume that they were the true Israel and that the Jews themselves were impostors. In their carefully documented and entertaining chapter on British Israelism, Popkin and Katz describe the development of the improbable belief that the Anglo-Saxon nations were the true heirs of the ancient Hebrews and the sole beneficiaries of God's promises to them. ('British' equals the Hebrew brit-ish, 'man of the covenant'; 'Saxon' is from 'Isaac-sons'. Scottish plaid comes from Joseph's coat of many colours etc.) This theory not only obviated the need for any conversion of the actual Jews, but, in the Christian Aryan movement in the United States, allowed the status of the Jews to be 'progressively devalued and demonised'. And in its more extreme forms, the belief that the Anglo-Saxons are God's chosen people inspires violent fantasies of revenge against the racially mixed society of contemporary America. The Oklahoma bomber was reading William Luther Pierce's The Turner Diaries, a novel about the white revolution against Jews, Blacks and Hispanics. Although some of these reactionary messianisms draw on apocalyptic literature, their vision of the future is unmistakably cast in the imperial mould. Whereas the apocalyptic looks forward to a new heaven and a new earth defined almost entirely by its dissimilarity to everything that has preceded it, the white supremacists hope to recreate a mythical all-white America, governed only by the Constitution. Their attitude to the degeneration they see around them is that shared by Plato and Eliot. The apocalyptic mentality, which sees racial and other forms of mixing primarily as a portent of things to come, is now far more mainstream. As Eco observes, 'the great revolution of our century is not technical but social... The simple fact that racism and intolerance are frowned upon today are proof of it. It involved a total reversal of human relations and relationships.' The point is not that this revolution has been inspired by the apocalyptic (as abolitionism was in 19th-century America) but rather that the openness to change, the acceptance that even what might appear to be decadence and degeneration holds some future promise, is characteristic of the apocalyptic rather than the traditional or imperial view of history. So what, if anything, is apocalyptic about the end of this millennium? It is not that a long period of time is, by general acknowledgment (if not precise calculation: the century actually ends next year), coming to an end. Temporal endings do not, in themselves, seem all that important to us. If Prince had simply said 'party like it's 1999' without supplying the accompanying images of death, destruction and judgment, I'm not sure that people would have known, 17 years ago, exactly how partying like it's 1999 differed from partying 'like it's Saturday night'. It is rather something about the changing dynamics of our society, our unprecedented willingness to dissolve hierarchies and the taboos that sustain them. Even though many of these changes are very recent, we tend to take them for granted. In 'Miami', which was re-released with the 'Will 2K' single, Will Smith describes a place where 'every day is Mardi Gras' and we can party with 'all ages and races... every different nation'. Fifty years ago this would have been absurd. Only books like The Turner Diaries treat these changes with the astonishment they should rightly provoke. But when we consign such reactions to an apocalyptic fringe we do ourselves an injustice. Almost the whole of human history, every tradition, every civilisation stands firmly alongside them. Ours is the apocalypse, theirs the empire. • Malcolm Bull's Seeing Things: Apocalypse, Vision and Totality is published by Verso • To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

Shoppers in this country have spent £2bn online in the last 12 months, and web retailers have high hopes for the festive season. With all this money being spent online, should we really still be hung up on credit card security? Publicly, credit card companies, banks and electronic retailers pooh-pooh \"scare stories\", and insist e-commerce is safe provided shoppers exercise common sense. Fraud on the internet is a minor problem, they say. But research, and the card companies' actions, suggest otherwise. PricewaterhouseCoopers says fraudulent e-commerce transactions make up half the annual fraud total in the US. In the UK, the National Criminal Intelligence Service says that internet fraud is \"an emerging threat\" that will increase significantly. British banks, said to be concerned by online fraud, are working on improving security for credit card transactions - in particular to stop programs, easily downloaded from the net, which can make \"valid\" credit card numbers from an algorithm. Fraudsters can then use those numbers for small \"virtual\" purchases, like access to porn sites, in the hope that the small transactions will not be checked by retailers or the real card holders. When shoppers like Helen Carter (see panel) do realise they are the victims of fraud, their problem is almost instantly blamed on the net. So where does the truth lie? Anthony Abraham, of Canadian-based watchdog Fraud Watch, says it's somewhere in the middle. Credit cards were not designed for the uses they are put to today. Safeguards such as signatures, magnetic strips and holograms were all designed for face to face transactions. But credit cards are still the best bet for buying goods over the internet simply because even if you are caught up in a scam, the worst you face is a maximum bill of £50 - after a nasty fright when you get your statement. \"Most consumers don't know where to shop on the net,\" says Abraham. \"Using a credit card, at least you know you're not going to be liable for more than £50. And in many cases the credit card company will simply write it off, if they find the credit card has not been authorised. \"As far as we go today, that's probably the best thing you've got going for you. Cheques are no good because you may send it and the vendor simply runs off with your money - that's a big problem with auction sites. And you can't send money orders because you can't get them back.\" So for e-commerce credit cards are just the best payment method of a mediocre bunch. \"To my mind,\" says Abraham, \"the credit card has always been meant to be used in person, where a person can actually go to a store, which can ensure that his signature is the one on the back of the card. Now, people use the credit card over the phone, and over the internet. The problem isn't just over the internet - it lies in how merchants have over the years accepted their use.\" Even sites using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are not automatically safe to shop at, he points out. The technology ensures information is secure while in transit over the internet, but if that sensitive information is on its way to a fraudulent merchant, it will make no difference. \"The number one complaint at our site is credit card fraud. If someone gives their credit card to a so-called fraud merchant, first you're billed for services that were probably never rendered. Second, the site disappears with your number. Third, a lot of these merchants sell the numbers on, so who knows who could be using your card number in the future? What you end up having to do is cancel your card once you hear about it.\" But Sandra Alzetta, senior vice president of e-commerce in the European Union for Visa, insists fraud is not a big problem. \"I'm a bit alarmed to see all this stuff on television and in newspapers,\" she says. \"It is quite right to highlight the issues of fraud, but what we don't want is scaremongering and mass panic.\" Visa does not keep statistics on internet-specific fraud, but says that fraud in total makes up \"less than 0.1%\" of its total transactions. \"Fraud will always happen where you have money involved,\" she says. \"You have a thief who wants to steal money or an academic who wants to show off his prowess by showing he can break security features. While it would be lovely to say 'one day there will be no fraud', that's not the case. What we need to do is manage it so it's a very small problem.\" She also tries to explain recent figures from industry body the Credit Card Research Group which, despite aiming to promote the use of credit and debt cards, showed that although the internet only made up 2% of transactions, it generated 50% of complaints. She says the large numbers of people going online and shopping for the first time means a large number of queries about problems which may be the fault of the shoppers themselves. \"We are seeing a disproportionate number of disputes raised from internet based transactions as opposed to face to face transactions. But that's completely as you would expect when you have something that is new. Disputes are when a customer is picking up a phone and calling the issuing bank to say 'I've got a question for you'.\" Alzetta says \"complaints\" divide into three piles: queries where cardholders have ordered something by accident, cases where merchants worry cardholders through \"sloppy practices\" like not putting their publicly recognised name on the statements, and more rarely, genuine cases of fraud. \"One of the things we are working on is customer regulation, to say that in the future, the actual name of the website has to appear on your statement,\" she adds. \"There are a whole bunch of things like that where there is no fraud involved, but there are queries. We have to educate cardholders, educate merchants and bring in best practices.\" Alan Stevens of Which? Online, the Consumers' Association's online arm, also says educating consumers is the key issue. Using credit cards over the net is safe - but only when following strict guidelines, he says. \"We would say yes, you are safe to use credit cards over the net, given two provisos: the first being that you're connected to a secure site, with the closed padlock or https showing and, secondly, if you're using a site based in the UK so that, for example, the Sale of Goods Act and the Consumer Credit Act come into play.\" Fail to follow that advice, says Stevens, and the risks shoot up. \"If you're buying from outside the European Union, you have to be aware that there are potentially no guarantees of redress. If you're buying low budget items like a ticket, or a CD, and you're prepared to take the risk that's fine, but you have to be prepared to take that risk. \"If you follow the advice, the lawmakers are looking after you. If your credit card was misused in any way without your knowledge, then you would not be liable and, therefore, it is fair to say that if it's a secure site in the UK, you are safe shopping over the net. It's right to say credit cards weren't designed for use over the net, but they work perfectly well, given the right circumstances.\" More than anything, says Richard Tyson-Davies of the Association for Payment Clearing Services, we've become dependant on our flexible friends for so many of our routine transactions that we are willing to face a degree of risk in using them. \"I think that in this country, payments where the card are not present have grown enormously, and are a way of life. Initially they were for buying flowers or cinema tickets, but we couldn't man age without them now and I don't think that any bank would dream of removing the facility for its customers. The numbers of problems which emerge are still minuscule. Most customers can use the web [to shop] if they apply normal sense to it. It would be ludicrous for the banks to stop people when they themselves are trying to promote web banking in all its forms.\" He adds that technology may also go some way to solving the problem that it has created. \"Smart\" cards with microchips embedded in them are expected to arrive in two years' time and wipe out duplication or \"skimming\" of credit cards. They will also help authenticate cards in online transactions. \"Having a chip on the card means you can employ a whole new raft of security. You could have a reader on your PC or even your phone, and that would provide an additional reassurance to the retailer that you actually have the card when making the transaction.\" In the meantime, online shoppers will just have to make up for the credit card's lack of high-tech credentials, by parting with their details with great care - and making sure they scan their bills carefully every month. Staying safe on the net Ten tips to help you avoid being the the victim of online fraud 1 Look for security. When you order goods, the website should switch to a secure section - look for an unbroken key or lock in the bottom left hand corner of your screen, and the internet address changing from \"http:\" to \"https:\". Never shop without this basic security. 2 Deal only with businesses you trust. Make sure you know where it is physically located, so that you have an idea of what laws it will be governed by. 3 Shop only with UK-based websites. Then at least you know you have British consumer protection laws on your side. 4 Look out for schemes like the Consumers' Association's Which? Online webtrader scheme. That means the site has been inspected and approved, and the association will guarantee the security of your transaction. 5 Keep records. Print out or save order verification screens and order confirmation numbers so that - just like a till receipt - you have some proof of your order. 6 Take your time. High pressure sales tactics online, just like the real world, often indicate possible frauds. 7 Check return policies, delivery details and privacy statements, which should all be available on any reputable retailer's website. They should tell you what happens if your goods are damaged or faulty, how soon they should arrive, and what happens to your personal information. 8 Beware of buying from unsolicited emails, newsgroup postings, chat rooms or online auctions. If anything goes wrong redress could be difficult. And, whatever you do, don't give away your credit card details. 9 Don't judge reliability by a flashy website. Increasing numbers of con-merchants are taking the simple steps of buying internet addresses and slick websites to help their scams. 10 If in doubt about an offer, ask. A legitimate company will be happy to help, while frauds might be more reluctant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/02/northernireland1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-02T12:22:28Z","webTitle":"'A great sense of pride'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/02/northernireland1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/02/northernireland1","fields":{"headline":"'A great sense of pride'","bodyText":"Bertie Ahern, Irish prime minister: Every Irish person is entitled to feel a great sense of pride today in what we have been able to achieve together to bring about a lasting peace throughout Ireland. I know that our joy today is shared by Irish people everywhere, by those of Irish ancestry living abroad and by the many friends of Ireland throughout the world. Tony Blair, British prime minister: There is still a lot to do - a long journey to travel. There is at least the hope that the hand of history is at last lifting the burden of terror and violence and shaping the future of the people of Northern Ireland and in particular the children. David Trimble, first minister designate: No more talking-shops. For decades we have had talking-shops of one sort or another. We're going to have an institution with responsibility in terms of what it has to do and responsibility to people as well. That is going to change the culture in terms of how politics in Northern Ireland is conducted - and not before time. Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president: For me the significance is the scrapping of the Government of Ireland Act. With the scrapping of that act there is a firm indication that the status quo that that represented has now changed and is continuing to change and will change irreversibly. We have taken seats in British prisons and in British interrogation centres... We're here in this institution because Stormont rule has gone. People waking up this morning, apart from the very large number of people who have suffered previously in the course of the conflict, I am sure and feel in their bones we're all better off. Nora Owen, deputy leader of Irish opposition party Fine Gael: I am reminded that this agreement has come into force without the bloodshed, without a civil war, without the fighting that my grand uncle [Michael Collins] faced when he came back from Downing Street. Peter Mandelson, British secretary of state for Northern Ireland: We today open a new chapter between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. For most of this century constitutional issues have divided the people, erected barriers and fuelled violence. But now, with the Good Friday Agreement fully implemented, we can resolve all those differences. For the first time in 80 years all the people of this island have had a chance to express their views and choose a vision for agreement. David Andrews, Irish foreign minister: The true success of the agreement will be judged by whether it frees the people of Ireland, north and south, nationalist and unionist, to live and work together without regard to labels or categories. Sir Ronnie Flanagan, RUC chief constable: As we enter a new millennium, not to be dramatic, I think we do so with great optimism and hope. Today is a very important step in that entire process. There are difficulties ahead and we can't ignore those, and we certainly will not ignore those, but I have no doubt ... the movement is in the positive direction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/03/catholicism.religion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-03T13:29:58Z","webTitle":"Patriot number games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/03/catholicism.religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/03/catholicism.religion","fields":{"headline":"Patriot number games","bodyText":"Running through the tide of commentaries on Northern Ireland is a disturbingly trite little sub-current of wishful thinking about the demography of the province. It is generally accepted that the proportion of Catholics/nationalists in the population has risen during the troubles from roughly 33% to around 40% or even more. When that figure reaches the magic 50%, so the misguided theory runs, the Northern Ireland issue will be resolved. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Northern Ireland question has always been part of a bigger conundrum, involving three minorities. For the past 30 years or more, attention has been focused on the Catholic minority in the six counties of the north of Ireland. Self-evidently, that minority could not be accommodated within the artificial statelet set up by the exasperated and war-weary establishments of London and Dublin in 1921. It has taken us three wasted generations to acknowledge that palpable fact. So now there is the shady, vague outline of a new Ireland in which sovereignty and territorial division are giving way to a new pragmatic relationship between north and south. But we should not kid ourselves that the gut feeling of tribal and national loyalty has gone away. If, or rather when, the minority in the north becomes a majority, we will be confronted by a new and even more looming Irish question. That is, to put it crudely, how can a million Protestant/loyalists - the second minority - be accommodated within a united Ireland? There is a woolly, deluded school of thought that when the great day dawns when the Catholics achieve a majority in the six counties, the Prods will simply hang up their bowler hats and sign on for Gaelic classes. That is nonsense. So too is the more cynical theory that nobody cares in this material age about the colours on the flag flying over us. Nationality and sovereignty remain potent issues, nowhere more than in Ireland. The brutal fact is that the half-million minority in Northern Ireland has been contained - some would say subjugated - not by the million-odd majority, but the 50-plus millions who live in the rest of the United Kingdom. That brings us to the third minority: the Republic of Ireland. On its own, it has plenty of goodwill, but it simply does not have the wider resources to contain a disaffected quarter of its whole population. This is a crude analysis, certainly, but it is a good deal more germane than the daft assumption that the problem will go away as soon as the loyalists are outnumbered. It won't. The endless argument will simply shift from one minority to another. The truth, uncomfortable for some, is that Britain and Ireland together have to sort out a new, larger relationship in which no community feels threatened or undermined. In that great enterprise, we will be hampered by history, but aided by the simple truth that we have much more in common than that which separates us. Useful links Special report: Northern Ireland A land fit for euros The Tories are crowing about the slide in the value of the euro, which has taken it below parity with the dollar. It just goes to show, they say, how foolish the government is even to consider scrapping the good old pound, which is riding high on the international exchanges. Hang on a mo. A strong pound means we can import cheaply. That undermines home production. It also throttles exports, by making them expensive. Is that the Tory vision for the future? Since its launch 11 months ago, the euro has gently subsided by around 16%. Much of that is attributable not to the inherent value of the currency, based as it is on a steadily growing Euro-economy, but rather to the greed of speculators and manipulators in the allegedly free market. When British interest rates rise to stem the inflation caused by a tide of cheap imports, they will make another killing. In due course, when the economy is suitably ravaged and interest rates fall, they will extract a further profit by buying cheap euros. And all the while the Europhobes will whine and grizzle about how unfair it all is, and why we should have nothing more to do with filthy foreigners.

The 78-year-old leader of the Unification Church, dogged by suspicion from his beginnings in South Korea to his adopted home in the US, has tried to start afresh in Latin America. He has bought more than 200 square miles of pasture land near the border with Paraguay and Bolivia, where he plans to create an industrial and educational centre for local people and his dwindling flock of a few thousand mainly Oriental believers. But four years and more than £20 million into the experiment, Moon is once more attracting scepticism and opposition. 'I do not believe his aims are purely philanthropic because he has made this huge investment,' says Fernando Gabeira, a Green member of Congress who leads a working group investigating Moon's activities. 'Everything points to the fact he is building an empire.' Bruno Padron, Catholic Bishop of Jardim, the nearest town to Moon's base at the New Hope Ranch, accuses the Unification Church of seducing poor families with the promise of food and then brainwashing them to stay. The allegations from politicians focus on his tax situation, the alleged polluting of nearby rivers and worries that he will buy adjacent land on both sides of the Paraguayan border, making border checks impossible. The general manager of the ranch and Moon's spokesman in Brazil, Cesar Zadusky dismisses all criticism. 'Moon spent 20 years in Asia, then 20 years in the Protestant US. Now he wants to help the Catholic world. He has not come here to take, just to give.' The New Hope Ranch complex contains a primary school for 116 local children. Next year a secondary school will open and within three years a university. Moon discovered the area around Jardim during a fishing holiday five years ago. He quickly started buying land and nurturing the idea that the area was the 'zero point for the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth'. But swiftly the religious aspect was toned down. To buy favour, Moon bought ambulances for all the local municipalities, but the mayor of Jardim says that, despite promises of jobs and investment, the local community has had little benefit from Moon's millions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/dec/06/gayrights.duncancampbell","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-06T16:42:00Z","webTitle":"Out to win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/06/gayrights.duncancampbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/06/gayrights.duncancampbell","fields":{"headline":"Out to win","bodyText":"It is only appropriate that the mayoral candidate who was once a stand-up comedian should base his headquarters at Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint. But Tom Ammiano has no time to stand up and tell jokes just now because he's too busy running in a race that could make him, against all the odds, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city. \"This has been fascinating to see,\" says Hank Wilson, one of the key members of Ammiano's campaign team as he sorts through \"Win, Tom, Win\" badges and the lists of volunteers, most of them political virgins, in the back of Josie's. \"It has just captured the imagination of large numbers of people who were previously not involved in politics in any way. We have a sense of historical momentum.\" And fascinating to see it certainly has been. On November 4, to the amazement of political pundits and press, the self-effacing Ammiano came second to the incumbent Willie L Brown Jnr, with 44,539 votes to 67,912, forcing a run-off because Brown had failed to win more than 50% of the vote. Now the gloves are off and Ammiano's growing army of the disenfrachised are hoping that by polling day on December 14 they will have persuaded enough of the doubters and floaters to seize the prize. San Francisco is, of course, no ordinary American city. Its history of radicalism, from the 1934 general strike through the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 60s and 70s to the Gay Pride movement of the late 70s and 80s, is worn like a badge of honour. And the two candidates, both registered Democrats, are no ordinary American politicians. Willie Brown, who became San Francisco's first black mayor four years ago, came to the city as a boy from Texas to join his grandmother, graduated from San Francisco state university, studied law and became a successful attorney and a civil rights activist. He was a young gun in the Democratic Party of the 60s and worked his way up to become the state assembly speaker in Sacramento before returning to the city as mayor. His supporters point to his civil rights record, his ability to bring some dash and style to the city after years of dull mayors and his long-time championship of gay rights - he is the only mayor to have carried out gay weddings in city hall and was instrumental in bringing in legislation that gave gay domestic partners among the city's workforce the same pension and health rights as married couples. Brown has the backing of organised labour - police, firefighters and municipal transport workers all received big wage increases this year - of the Republican party, whose members have held their noses and endorsed him, and of mainstream Democrats. But his detractors criticise his supposed cronyism and autocratic, imperial style, and poke fun at his sharp suits and fancy down-town social life. More pertinently, they say he has not fulfilled his promise of sorting out public transport and the homelessness that has turned the centre of the city into a human tolbooth of panhandlers. Tom Ammiano, originally from New Jersey, came to the city as a teacher and taught in Vietnam before becoming a stand-up comedian playing the local clubs. He went into politics as a member of the board of education in 1990 and became president of the board of supervisors last year. He was not going to run this time, he says, but was finally persuaded so late in the race that no one thought he had a chance. More than 10,000 voters were registered by his team in 10 days in a mad flurry of enthusiasm. Ammiano's supporters point to his record of helping beleaguered tenants squeezed by the Silicon Valley effect, his championship of the low-paid with his plans to bring in an $11 an hour minimum wage for city employees, his support for cyclists and environmentalists and his general approachability. Hank Wilson recalls Ammiano attending anti-apartheid pickets of the docks in the 70s at dawn. His detractors warn of mighty tax increases and fiscal chaos if someone as inexperienced were to be in charge; they see his campaign as amateurish and anarchist. Hank Wilson and George, another volunteer campaigner, point to the list of endorsements pinned up at Josie's as a sign of the broad spectrum of support Ammiano is generating: the Sierra Club, the Green Party, Poets for Ammiano, the Californian Nurses Association, the Bike Messengers Association, the Probation Officers Association and, most recently, the Bay View, which has just won the National Black Chamber of Commerce's black national newspaper of the year award. \"We have been disappointed, some say betrayed, by a mayor who had the resources and the power and the brilliance to lift all the boats in this rising economic tide,\" says the Bay View's publisher, Willie Ratcliff, who threw his weight behind Brown's campaign four years ago. \"The groundswell of support for Tom Ammiano signifies a movement, a joining together of the many stripes of the rainbow.\" Ratcliff says that Ammiano's success so far in an \"upstart, shoestring, write-in campaign proves that people power can beat big money\". (Clint Reilly, a political consultant and one of the unsuccessful candidates in the first round, spent $4m compared to Ammiano's $20,000. Reilly hates Brown so much that he is now backing Ammiano.) In the Ammiano heartland of the Castro, with its rainbow flags flying from every lamp-post, past Uncle Mame's toys and souvenirs shop (\"Vote Tom\" poster in the window) and a couple of blocks down from Josie's is a massive Day-Glo poster proclaiming: \"Mayor Willie Brown - Leadership that Unifies\". The poster carries the endorsements of the Alice B Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club and Lesbians and Gays of African Descent. While many black voters may be backing Brown, others take the Ratcliff view and have joined Ammiano's campaign. And while Ammiano's campaign's power-base is in the gay community, by no means all major gay organisations want him to win and gay businesses are by no means convinced of his economic abilities. Jesse Jackson, an old ally of both men, even made a special trip to the Castro district to try to persuade Ammiano not to run, saying there was no need while a \"rainbow coalition\" politico was already standing. Clinton has endorsed Brown in radio commercials. Nowhere else in the United States would two candidates of such radical backgrounds be vying for the highest office. However, just as, even in San Francisco, some will never vote for Brown because of the colour of his skin, some will never accept a gay mayor and Ammiano has received death threats. As if to remind people of what is at stake, a television docu-drama was screened last week recounting the story of Harvey Milk, the city's first openly gay supervisor who was, along with the liberal mayor George Moscone, shot dead by a paranoid and disgruntled ex-policeman named Don White in 1978. Milk was Ammiano's mentor to a certain extent and the presence of a plainclothes policeman at Ammiano's side is an indication that death threats already issued are being taken seriously, particularly for someone who travels to work by public transport. Internet messages from people who will \"never vote for a faggot\" have suggested that Ammiano is a \"sitting duck\" as he travels to work by public transport from his home in Bernal Heights. At the West Portal elementary school, where Ammiano once taught, hundreds gathered to hear the two candidates square up at a debate organised last week by the League of Women Voters. The hall was packed and many of Ammiano's supporters, stuck outside on the balmy December night, cried foul, claiming that Brown's machine had ensured that their dissident voices would not be heard. \"Win, Tom, win!\" was the cry as jumpy police officers moved in to close the doors to the debate, provoking further claims that this was all part of Brown's machiavellian plot to stitch up the contest. Brown was duly greeted with a standing ovation. The debate was on the dry side, with Ammiano trying to reassure the middle-class voters that he would not be a mad taxer. He is not as polished and assured a speaker as Brown, who can, in the words of one local reporter, switch his delivery from \"smooth, trained lawyer to brother\" at will. Ammiano does not have Brown's assurance and comes over as nervous and ill at ease in debate, which is odd for someone who has been both a teacher and a comedian. So is there really going to be an upset? \"It's a city of discontent right now and if that spills over in the next couple of weeks it could happen,\" says the San Francisco Chronicle columnist Ken Garcia, who grew up in the city's Sunset neighbourhood and has covered the Brown years closely. \"There are just enough people who dislike Willie Brown and who will take change at any cost.\" The \"most surreal thing\" about the election, he says, is that the Republicans who would happily dance on Brown's carcass are endorsing him, so terrified are they of the possibility that Ammiano might win. \"We're optimistic,\" says Belinda Griswald, the frazzled but resilient press offficer for the Ammiano campaign and a former reporter. She says the latest poll indicates they have 35% of the vote to Brown's 45%. \"Last time, we were polling 12% just before the election and won 25% of votes cast.\" Griswald is reasonably happy with the way the campaign has been covered although she believes the mainstream press has pulled its punches on Brown: \"The mayor's fantasies have not been interrupted; he has not been called, but that's what the mainstream press in this country does.\" A group called San Franciscans for Sensible Government, which includes Don Fisher, the chairman of Gap, is spending $150,000 on television commercials to highlight Ammiano's alleged laxity. Both the Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, the two main papers which are about to merge, will back Brown but his team is worried that this may still not be enough if all the fired-up young voters - the web-heads, the cyclists, the angry tenants, the Brown-haters - turn out. The two bulky and radical freesheets, the Bay Guardian and the SF Weekly, have printed acres of coverage sympathetic to Ammiano. The SF Weekly sees Ammiano's campaign as \"the class of outsiders led by their favourite teacher\". Less than half the electorate - 43% - bothered to vote last time and Brown's support is seen as soft. Back at Josie's, a sign has been stuck on the wall: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has - Margaret Mead.\" By next week, Ammiano's fresh-faced canvassers will see whether they have been able to change a small corner of the world or whether Willie B will be raising his fedora triumphantly once more. Either way, the juice will certainly be flowing at the joint come December 14.

One might say the same of the home secretary himself. When not abolishing jury trials, he amuses himself by tormenting asylum seekers; when bored with trying to extradite David Shayler, he privatises a few more prisons. And, when there's nothing else to occupy his time, he introduces yet another terrorism bill. The only glimmer of humour in this sinister new legislation is the title of schedule 8, part II: \"Inchoate and Related Offences\". Perhaps the joke is unintentional, but I can't be the only reader of the bill to recall Sydney Smith's famous line: \"Many inchoate acts are innocent, the consummation of which is a capital offence.\" Until now, British governments have regarded this as an important distinction. Nearly 150 years ago, for instance, the Austrian ambassador in London complained to Sir George Grey, the home secretary, that Karl Marx and other members of the Communist League were discussing \"the murder of princes\". By way of reply, Grey treated the ambassador to a rather lofty lecture on the nature of liberal democracy: \"Under our laws, mere discussion of regicide, so long as it does not concern the Queen of England and so long as there is no definite plan, does not constitute sufficient grounds for the arrest of the conspirators.\" It does now. Under clause 57 of the bill, it will be a criminal offence to \"incite another person to commit an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom . . . It is immaterial whether or not the person incited is in the United Kingdom at the time of the incitement\". And what precisely is an act of terrorism? Let me remind you of the bill's remarkable definition: \"In this act 'terrorism' means the use or threat , for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, of action which involves serious violence against any person or property .\" In other words, if someone in Budleigh Salterton \"incites\" a friend in Baden Baden to issue a \"threat\" to hurl paint over a statue of Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, a crime will have been committed. This country has a long record of offering shelter to displaced agitators: refugees as diverse as VI Lenin and General de Gaulle lived as exiles in London, scheming and dreaming, before returning in triumph to their native lands. It is a typical \"new\" Labour triumph to take the one British tradition of which we can feel unequivocally proud and turn it into a criminal offence. If the Straw law had been in force 20 or 30 years ago, every supporter of the African National Congress in Britain would have been liable to prosecution. Anyone who demanded the eviction of Indonesian troops from East Timor, or spoke in support of the Sri Lankan Tamils, could also have expected a visit from Sergeant Straw and his brigade of plods. And what of John Major - who, after the Gulf war, urged Iraqis to rise up and overthrow Saddam Hussein? A letter in Monday's Guardian even wondered if we could use the new law to indict Tony Blair, \"for plotting to use Trident\". Not so, alas. Straw has wisely added a line at the end of clause 57 which effectively places himself - and Blair and Major - above the law of the land: \"Nothing is this section imposes criminal liability on any person acting on behalf of, or holding office under, the Crown.\" So it's OK for British ministers to support counter-coups in Sierra Leone, but if the rest of us follow their example we shall be thrown in the slammer. When Sir Keith Joseph was spreading the gospel of Thatcherism to hostile university audiences in the mid-1970s, he often used the story of Karl Marx to win round leftwing hecklers. \"I am proud that such a man found sanctuary in England,\" he would shout over the hubbub. \"That's why I believe so passionately in Western democratic values: without them Das Kapital would never have been written.\" Having already achieved the impressive feat of making Michael Howard look like a bleeding-heart liberal, Jack Straw is now determined to prove himself even more rightwing than the late Keith Joseph. What on earth will he do for an encore? • Bug off Rupert University College Oxford has celebrated its 750th birthday by hosting seven lectures from \"Builders of the Millennium\". The first speaker in the series was Tony Blair; the last was Rupert Murdoch. My bags were searched thoroughly when I arrived at the Sheldonian Theatre for Murdoch's performance last week. Inside, throughout the evening, anxious security guards scanned the room and muttered into their mouthpieces. One might almost think that Rupert had a few enemies. Did the authorities fear that Lord Rees-Mogg would storm the stage, yelling \"freedom for Tibet!\", and fell his employer with a karate chop? As it turned out, the lecture pased off without incident. Very much so: the king of the communications industry is a chronically feeble communicator, who read his speech with all the dramatic passion of the speaking clock. Not content with boring his listeners, poor Rupert seemed even to be boring himself as he droned on about the brilliance of Tony Blair and the \"empowerment\" provided by the internet. The only thing that kept me awake was spotting the autobiographical subtext. \"So much of what was science fiction 50 years ago is today part of our lives,\" he said, during yet another hymn to the wonders of technology. \"We have every reason to expect that medical science will bless us with still much longer and more useful lives . . . We have already passed the day in which the celebration of a 100th birthday is worth much media coverage . . . Hip and knee replacements have the elderly bounding around the tennis courts.\" Those financial analysts who wonder what will happen to News Corp when Murdoch falls off his perch should stop worrying: he intends to live for ever. Rather more surprising was Murdoch's emergence as a champion of monogamy. \"It is only durable family values that can provide the sense of intergenerational obligation that will make the young tend to their elders.\" As I could see only the back of her head, I can't say if Wendi Deng - the third Mrs Murdoch - blushed at this point. Rupert himself certainly didn't. \"Child abuse, delinquency and poor school performance are all higher for children living in other than traditional family settings,\" he continued, apparently forgetting that in 1967 he abandoned his first wife (with whom he had had a daughter) to run off with young Anna Torv. Even the shameless Murdoch, however, seemed rather embarrassed by the title of the lecture series. \"I fear that I may be here under false pretences,\" he admitted. \"Unlike your opening speaker, the prime minister, or the brilliant Stephen Hawking, I would hardly classify myself as one of the 'builders of the millennium'.\" Quite so. In recognition of his talent for corrupting and debasing everything he touches, University College should have given Rupert his correct title: the Millennium Bug. • Say 'yes' for the General At Christmas, even Lord Lamont of Lerwick tries to think of those less fortunate than himself. \"Dear Friend,\" he writes, in a round robin that has somehow found its way on to my desk, \"Will you join me in the battle to free General Augusto Pinochet? He needs our help and I'm writing to you and other conservatives in America who are sympathetic to his plight . . . All you need do is tick YES on your Personal Reply. Then pop it in today's post, or mail as you probably call it.\" Norman Lamont's grasp of American lingo may be faultless, but the rest of his brain is incurably addled, to judge by the PS: \"Please remember that General Pinochet's only crime was that he stopped communism in South America.\" Presumably the torture and murder of one's own citizens are too trifling to count as crimes. Even more bizarrely, Lamont goes on to claim that Pinochet is a victim of \"Britain's leftwing government\". Leftwing? I trust that Tony Blair will issue a libel writ forthwith."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/08/ruralaffairs.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-08T18:30:03Z","webTitle":"Brown diverts cash to green farming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/08/ruralaffairs.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/08/ruralaffairs.politics","fields":{"headline":"Brown diverts cash to green farming","bodyText":"Farmers are to get far bigger grants to \"go green\" and protect the countryside - but will lose some food subsidies to help pay for the programme, the government announced yesterday. Money to convert farms to organic methods will triple and there will be big increases for other environmentally friendly schemes to save hedgerows, woodlands and moorlands, encourage wildlife, promote animal welfare and ensure the survival of traditions such as thatching roofs and building dry-stone walls. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, announced a phased 60% increase for English rural development funds yesterday and similar packages are planned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The extra cash for the £1.6bn seven-year package comes from the treasury and small, but increasing, cuts in traditional production payments. Mr Brown insisted most farmers should still gain, especially hard-pressed hill sheep and beef farmers in some of the most beautiful parts of Britain, and whose incomes are now down to an average £2,000 a year. But the National Farmers' Union called the move a \"tax on farmers\". Its president Ben Gill said: \"At a time when farm incomes are under critical pressure, we are extremely con cerned at these plans to take money out of farmers' pockets.\" Under Mr Brown's package there will be new funds to help farmers diversify into areas such as bed and breakfasts, tourism or providing office space in their old barns. Marketing and training schemes will also be started to help farmers become better at selling their produce, rather than rely on hand-outs. Mr Brown conceded that the £295m annual spending on green measures by 2006 would still be small compared to the £5.3bn a year European Union common agriculture policy package from which British farmers benefit. But he said: \"We intend a dramatic expansion in the use we make of rural development measures here in the United Kingdom. It points the way forward for the CAP.\" The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds welcomed the announcement as a \"firm step in the right direction\", that might help reverse the decrease in wildlife and create new jobs, but Friends of the Earth said the amounts to encourage organic farming were still \"peanuts\". Lady Young, chairman of Engish Nature, the conservation quango, said Christmas had come early. \"It is the most important decision on the countryside for 20 years and the biggest cash injection into saving our wildlife ever.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/dec/09/artsfeatures.martinscorsese","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-09T03:23:26Z","webTitle":"The big hitter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/dec/09/artsfeatures.martinscorsese","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/dec/09/artsfeatures.martinscorsese","fields":{"headline":"The big hitter","bodyText":"Michael Powell once said of Martin Scorsese: \"He breakfasts on images\". But it still seems surprising that, while editing Raging Bull, Scorsese would watch Powell's ballet film Tales of Hoffman over and over again \"because of the movement in it\". Raging Bull is now considered Scorsese's most perfect film and one of the few American masterworks of the last 20 years. Boxing and ballet clearly have some parallels. Not everyone thought so at the time. Pauline Kael described De Niro's portrait of boxer Jake La Motta as \"a swollen puppet with only bits and pieces of a character inside\". And though the film got Oscars for its editing (Thelma Schoonmaker, Powell's widow) and for De Niro, Scorsese's nomination as director was unsuccessful. Where Kael was undoubtedly right was in her opinion that the film was as much a biography of the genre of boxing movies as about a particular fighter. Films such as Body and Soul, The Set-Up and Golden Boy are recalled in the film's slow motion sequences, rapid cutting and sweeping camera movements. What was new was the emotional and psychological intensity of a time (the 40s and 50s), a place (mostly New York, Scorsese's home ground) and a person (a champion fighter who in the end loses everything). When describing La Motta - the man who let himself be hit in order to exhaust his opponent's strength - Scorsese cited St Thomas Aquinas, who said that animals served God better than man because they lived their natures so purely, without guilt. But at the end of the film, he allows La Motta, whose brutality has hitherto extended from the ring into the lives of his wife and brother, to shout in his Maimi jail cell: \"I am not an animal!\" and begin his redemption. It is a typical Scorsese moment - in nearly all his films there is a character who is eventually offered the opportunity of atonement. Yet Paul Schrader, who wrote the first screenplay, loosely culled from La Motta's own ghosted book, has said that Raging Bull was not a film either Scorsese or he wanted to make. De Niro talked Scorsese into it and then the two of them talked him into it. It is by now common knowledge that De Niro was obsessed with the part and not only spent 10 weeks perfecting the fight scenes but took two breaks away from the shoot to eat his way around Italy and France to gain weight for the second half of the film. He went from his usual 145 lbs to 160lbs for the young fighter and then up to 215lbs for the flabby older man. This isn't acting but, as De Niro has said, it made him feel different and perform differently. As for the fight scenes themselves, they were brilliantly shot - heightened and precisely choreographed. Even the real La Motta was less frenetic than this in the ring. Schrader's original script was darker and much more sexual than the finished film. At one point La Motta, who abstained from sex for several weeks before a big fight, douses an erection with a glass of cold water. Everyone liked the scene but it would almost certainly have made Raging Bull into an X-rated film and it was never shot. As it is, the film looks perfect, imbued with a European sensibility, as someone once said of Scorsese, but \"molto Hollywood\". Jake La Motta: I remember those cheers they still ring in my ears, and for years they'll remain in my thoughts. Cuz one night I took off my robe and what'd I do, I forgot to wear shorts. I recall every fall, every hook, every jab, the worst way a guy could get rid of his flab. As you know, my life was a jab- Though I'd rather hear you cheer when I delve into Shakespeare. A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse, I haven't had a winner in six months. I know I'm no Olivier, but if he fought Sugar Ray, he would say that the thing ain't the ring it's the play. So gimme a stage where this bull here can rage. And thought I can fight I'd much rather recite. That's entertainment. That's entertainment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/12/letters.letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-12T00:01:14Z","webTitle":"Prescription for ordinary NHS medicine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/12/letters.letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/12/letters.letters","fields":{"headline":"Prescription for ordinary NHS medicine","bodyText":"Over the past dozen years I have been working in Salford serving the elderly of one of the most deprived communities in the United Kingdom. It has always seemed to me that the care provided for those most disadvantaged is the most sensitive marker of the health or otherwise of the NHS. Last week we moved into a beautiful, purpose-built, £11million building which, as well as acute wards, has an on-site stroke unit, a day hospital and rehabilitation facilities. This is the culmination of many years of honest incremental improvement in the care we provide for our older patients. It is also a reflection of the commitment of the NHS to the care for such people. Within our own Trust, we see nearly a million people a year. No institution that manages so many people will be perfect and it will remain adequate only by our continuous aspiration towards perfection. The painstaking processes of admission, treatment planning, multi-disciplinary care and thoughtful discharge have little to do with an image of the NHS dominated by news of doctors who steal organs, of serial killers and incompetent surgeons. In fact, these processes are extremely ordinary and therefore of no interest to the media. Our work is in no way assisted by comments from the editorial offices of a supposedly prestigious and respectable newspaper such as The Observer. It is ordinary medicine being practised in an ordinary corner of the NHS, by people who are passionate about the service to which they contribute and who often feel besieged by the adverse publicity that undermines their daily efforts. Raymond Tallis, Professor of Geriatric Medicine Hope Hospital, Manchester Why must some doctors and others whine and whinge their way into the twenty-first century? The negative comments about the online NHS Direct service at www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk (News, last week) by Dr Grant Kelly of the BMA show how many NHS professionals still live in the nineteenth century. As Will Hutton highlights in his column (Comment, last week), the NHS is riddled with bureaucracy, restrictive practices and lack of accountability. The opportunity now presents itself for a transformation of the NHS using web-based technology to open up decision-making and the process of health care. The demand for health and transparency in healthcare services is rising inexorably and the web is the most cost-effective way of engaging with patients by streamlining many processes from clinic bookings to consultations with doctors, our partners in health. It will take time to get right - so come on, Dr Kelly, get with the programme. Julian Fifield Witney, Oxon Dr Grant Kelly of the BMA criticises the new NHS online diagnostic service as a 'stunt' which is 'either so trite it is not worth having, or else it could lead to misdiagnosis'. I wonder, does Dr Kelly speak for the same BMA which produces the Complete Familiy Health Encyclopaedia with 'Symptom Charts' to aide self-diagnosis (RRP £35, available from all good booksellers)? Presumably the BMA book is neither a 'stunt' nor 'likely to lead to misdiagnosis'?

What's my home called? These are questions expected from somebody sitting up after being knocked senseless by a passing lorry. But now they are being asked by the inhabitants of the British Isles - though mostly by the English ones. Am I British or English or both? Is my country called Britain or England or the UK? Or what? This is a very recent bang on the head. Only two years ago, the BBC were planning a mega-series called A Thousand Years of British History, and were baffled to be told that there has been no such thing. And when a historian tried to console them by suggesting that they rename the series 'A Thousand Years of English Expansion', the BBC was really vexed. Now the mood is changing fast. The BBC itself has informed its employees that there is no British nation as such. And Professor Norman Davies has brought forth this history of the archipelago which ends with a prophecy that 'Ukania' will soon be over: 'I happen to belong to that group of opinion which holds the break-up of the United Kingdom to be imminent.' He feels a little sad. But he sees no need for serious gloom. 'All that is really valuable would remain... one would still be able to listen to Elgar's cello concerto. One could still watch Bolton Wanderers...' If you didn't know that Norman Davies was an English sort of Ukanian, and a Lancastrian sort at that, you know now. But, significantly, there is also Welshness in this Davies. And pride in that is one of the threads that guide him through this misty British labyrinth. Davies is an ambitious historian. He writes big books on big themes, intended to shatter conventional interpretations of the past and reassemble the bits in a quite new shape. His previous book, Europe: a History, contrived to shift the very focus of continental history writing eastwards, towards Prague and Warsaw. Now, with The Isles, he has set out to crush for ever the versions of history that ignore the multinational nature of 'Britain' and fail to confront the nature of England's expansion into what Russians call their 'near abroad'. Some people will pass this work off as a 'Celtification' of British history. There is certainly enthusiastic emphasis on Irish, Welsh and Scottish events, told for their own sake - for their significance to Ireland, Wales or Scotland - rather than as components of some teleological 'Britain's Story'. But what Davies has to say about England is more important. 'This realm of England is an Empire,' wrote Thomas Cromwell, composing the Act in Restraint of Appeals in the time of Henry VIII. To me, at least, those words have always seemed more fateful and revealing than the language of Magna Carta. The Isles is, in fact, less a Celtification than a Europeanisation. Davies insists on the European nature of England, at the same time that he rejects the 'anaesthetic of anglocentricity' in the treatment of English-Celtic relations. To emphasise the non-Englishness of those who ruled the kingdom, he doggedly refers to 'Edouard I' and 'Jean de Baliol' instead of Edward and John. 'In the Age of the Crusades, England was more comprehensively involved in continental affairs than at any time before or since.' It was only at the Reformation that England went into denial of this past, dragging away the unwilling smaller nations of the isles into this new insularity. The Reformation, Davies laments, 'cut off the isles from much of the Continent, and from the main body of Christendom which had been its spiritual home for the previous millennium... it forced [England] to develop along isolated, eccentric lines'. Every so often, Davies breaks off to quote, compare and criticise other historians. Near the beginning, he rather shockingly prefers the 'unreliable' Gildas (Celtic) to the Venerable Bede (Germanic). On the Reformation period, he contrasts nineteenth-century 'Protestant warhorses' (Froude, Neal, Fletcher) with the almost unknown Father Lingard, author of the first Catholic history of England. And as in all his large-scale histories, Davies provides quantities - sometimes pages - of poetry, from the Fenian cycles in Irish through Wesley and Kipling to the Welsh of Alan Llwyd (died 1948). With Davies, the reader gets the music as well as the words. There are weaknesses, though. Europe: a History showed how Davies's outrush of words could run ahead of his fact-checkers, and The Isles has too many mistakes - not all of detail. Take two Scottish examples. To write of the 'coronation' of Scottish kings (not 'inauguration') is to miss a crucial distinction, while to say that the 1979 devolution referendum required '40 per cent of the popular vote as the threshold for acceptance' is to confuse cast votes with registered electorate - concealing the whole scam of that poll. There is plenty of witty perception. 'Diana... was the first person of English descent ever to approach the British throne.' The monarchy lives on for the moment 'in a state of animated suspension'. This book, all the same, does not quite match the audacity and punch of Europe. It is well-written, clever and fascinating in detail. And yet it ends tentatively, asking a question as much as confidently providing the answer. What will it be like when Britain ends? 'A quietly gathering avalanche... no one could exactly predict what might be swept away. And no one could imagine what trifling incident could set it off.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/14/northernireland.ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-14T02:08:29Z","webTitle":"Irish take a giant step across the border into Armagh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/14/northernireland.ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/14/northernireland.ireland","fields":{"headline":"Irish take a giant step across the border into Armagh","bodyText":"They met in the ecclesiastical capital of the island, all 15 cabinet ministers from the Irish Republic journeying north into the United Kingdom. It had been, said one official, inconceivable until now. Bertie Ahern, taoiseach, his deputy Mary Harney and foreign affairs minister David Andrews arrived in a helicopter clattering through the freezing midwinter calm to Armagh, 10 miles beyond their jurisdiction. Their dozen colleagues invaded in a cortege of black Mercedes, an impressive sight as they snaked across the brow of the hill to Palace Demesne. The Irish government might have expected to run the gauntlet of hardline unionist protesters as they arrived at Armagh council offices for the inaugural meeting of the north-south ministerial council, a key leg of the Good Friday agreement. There was none. Police did not even bother to move security barriers into place. In the surreal world of the new Northern Ireland what was utterly astonishing seemed just like another day. How could it be otherwise, mused one British official, without malice, when an ex-IRA chief of staff is now in charge of primary and secondary schooling? It was a different story 25 years ago, when a similar experiment at cross-border co-operation was stillborn. Loyalist violence, including the killing of 33 people in the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings, the troubles' most murderous day, scuppered the council of Ireland, and with it, the Stormont power-sharing administration. Back in 1985, more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Belfast to protest after Margaret Thatcher and Garret Fitzgerald, then taoiseach, signed the Anglo-Irish agreement. The new arrangements, including six cross-border implementation bodies, supersede that controversial deal. Mr Ahern, conscious of the difficulties for Mr Trimble in a day packed with symbolism for nationalists, adopted the language of pragmatism. It conveyed the absurd notion that Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic had never been too far away from being the chummiest of neighbours. Mr Trimble's damage limitation buzzword for the day was \"cooperation\". Time and again, he lauded the concept, using it to emphasise the limiting republican aspirations to a united Ireland, while making anything less seem churlish in the extreme.

It had been, said one official, inconceivable until now. Bertie Ahern, taoiseach, his deputy Mary Harney and foreign affairs minister David Andrews arrived in a helicopter clattering through the freezing midwinter calm to Armagh, 10 miles beyond their jurisdiction. Their dozen colleagues invaded in a cortege of black Mercedes, an impressive sight as they snaked across the brow of the hill to Palace Demesne. The Irish government might have expected to run the gauntlet of hardline unionist protesters as they arrived at Armagh council offices for the inaugural meeting of the north-south ministerial council, a key leg of the Good Friday agreement. There was none. Police did not even bother to move security barriers into place. In the surreal world of the new Northern Ireland what was utterly astonishing seemed just like another day. How could it be otherwise, mused one British official, without malice, when an ex-IRA chief of staff is now in charge of primary and secondary schooling? It was a different story 25 years ago, when a similar experiment at cross-border co-operation was stillborn. Loyalist violence, including the killing of 33 people in the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings, the troubles' most murderous day, scuppered the council of Ireland, and with it, the Stormont power-sharing administration. Back in 1985, more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Belfast to protest after Margaret Thatcher and Garret Fitzgerald, then taoiseach, signed the Anglo-Irish agreement. The new arrangements, including six cross-border implementation bodies, supersede that controversial deal. Mr Ahern, conscious of the difficulties for Mr Trimble in a day packed with symbolism for nationalists, adopted the language of pragmatism. It conveyed the absurd notion that Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic had never been too far away from being the chummiest of neighbours. Mr Trimble's damage limitation buzzword for the day was \"cooperation\". Time and again, he lauded the concept, using it to emphasise the limiting republican aspirations to a united Ireland, while making anything less seem churlish in the extreme. He even cheekily suggested Friday's inaugural meeting of the British-Irish council, a talking shop comprising representatives from Westminster and Dublin as well as the three devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, was more important.

Politicians, worried that the killing would drive away foreign investment, piled pressure on the police to find an explanation. But while detectives said the 49-year-old South Korean businessman was almost certainly a victim of assassinaton, not robbery, they made no progress for months. Until yesterday. In a remarkable twist, the head of a rival Korean car company was accused of being behind the murder. Prosecutors in Pretoria alleged in court that Billy Rautenbach, a 40-year-old Zimbabwean who runs the Hyundai car firm in South Africa, played a \"key role\" in Yong's killing. But to add to the mystery, the alleged motive has nothing to do with cars. Mr Rautenbach controls a sprawling business empire that has earned him the sobriquet Napoleon of Africa. He owns not only the Hyundai concession but about 150 companies across the continent and beyond, including a few dozen registered in the Virgin Islands under the names of his cousin or aunt. The businesses range from trucking, mining and farming to a conglomeration of car assembly and distribution concessions which include the Volvo heavy vehicle franchise in 13 African countries. Mr Rautenbach has openly admitted paying bribes. His friends say he thrives on risk and has shrugged off the carping of businessmen in London and New York who complain his methods are cavalier. But in recent weeks Mr Rautenbach's kingdom has started to crumble amid accusations of fraud, tax evasion and dabbling in organised crime. The public prosecutor has put him on a shortlist of 20 alleged major economic criminals. Mr Rautenbach can probably withstand that, but there is another alleged line of business that threatens to bring about his collapse. Besides the allegation that he played a role in murder, prosecutors also accuse the former champion rally car driver of supplying arms to war-torn Congo. Some of the weapons allegedly come from Daewoo's armaments factory, which is separate from its car manufacturing operation. Prosecutors will not reveal precisely why they believe Mr Rautenbach wanted his rival out of the way but do say that South Africa's intelligence services and police believe he was doing business with Daewoo's gun factory and somehow crossed swords with Yong. The guns were destined for the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a civil war has embroiled several countries. The allegations against Mr Rautenbach were made during a high court hearing into whether the government has the right to seize his property after the office for serious economic offences carted off three lorry loads of documents from Mr Rautenbach's Johannesburg mansion. The papers allegedly detail various rackets including crooked claims for \"stolen\" cars and fraudulent bank loans. Mr Rautenbach caught the eye of South Africa's intelligence services after he was chosen to head Congo's state mining conglomerate a year ago without a jot of mining experience. His appointment came less than a day after Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, met the Congolese leader, Laurent Kabila, to discuss how to pay for Zimbabwean troops fighting for the Kinshasa government against Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels. Mr Kabila quickly took to his new associate, calling him Mr Billy in public. There is a widespread assumption in diplomatic circles that Mr Rautenbach was put in charge of Gecamines so he could siphon off profits from its vast cobalt and copper mining operations to the Zimbabwean government and army. After that came the weapons shipments to Congo's army in breach of South Africa's embargo. One prosecution source has said that Mr Rautenbach was identified as a key sponsor of the war. Mr Rautenbach has long shrugged off suggestions that he was a front for Mr Mugabe. \"Just because Zimbabwean troops are in Congo, and because I am a Zimbabwean, people put two and two together and come up with the wrong answer. In any case, I don't know Mugabe. I've never met him,\" he said earlier this year. But Mr Rautenbach is only too well known among Mr Mugabe's cohorts, including the justice minister, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who claims to have introduced the white man to Congo's president. Mr Rautenbach does not venture to South Africa these days, choosing instead to spend his time between Zimbabwe and Congo. That has not helped boost the confidence of his business partners. Volvo is exercising its option to take direct control of distribution of its vehicles. His Hyundai concession is reportedly tens of millions of pounds in debt. Last month, Mr Rautenbach was sacked from one of his two top positions in Gecamines amid company debts of up to $1bn. But he remains its chief executive, and Robert Mugabe's investment. Billy Rautenbach rode into business on the back of his father's small transport company, Wheels of Africa, started in Rhodesia in 1972. Under Billy Rautenbach's stewardship it grew to take in about 150 companies across the continent and beyond. Many are registered under the names of Rautenbach's relatives. The main businesses include: Wheels of fortune Car assembly and distribution: Rautenbach has a 50% stake in the Hyundai motor company in South Africa and Botswana. It maintains 23 outlets but is reportedly tens of millions of pounds in debt. There are other more profitable concessions to offset the losses, including a lucrative Volvo distribution that covers almost every country between South Africa and Kenya. Construction: Rautenbach imports and distributes construction equipment in South Africa, including some manufactured by Hyundai. Haulage : Wheels of Africa is one of the continent's biggest transport companies, moving goods almost its entire length with lucrative concessions into southern Congo. Land: Rautenbach owns farms and a safari company in Zimbabwe, and land in Kenya, Mozambique and Congo. Mining: He owns 70% of Ridgepointe Overseas, a cobalt mining company with a substantial concession in southern Congo - with 80% of profitsgoing to the government. Rautenbach was appointed chairman of the state-owned Gecamines mining company in Congo a year ago, before he had any mining experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/16/5","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-16T01:54:48Z","webTitle":"Baby hope dashed for cancer victim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/16/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/16/5","fields":{"headline":"Baby hope dashed for cancer victim","bodyText":"The government watchdog for regulating fertility treatment last night defended its refusal to allow a woman to have a baby using eggs she had frozen while having cancer treatment. Carolyn Neill, 34, of Belfast, froze her eggs before having radiotherapy and chemotherapy which could have made her infertile. The cancer has now been successfully treated and she wants to start a family. But the human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA) says it will not allow Ms Neill to remove the eggs or transport them to another country where the treatment is permitted - even though it allowed her to freeze them. Suzanne McCarthy, the authority's chief executive, said that, in spite of more than 30 successful births in countries such as the United States and Italy, it would continue to deny access until independent research had ruled out any risk. Ms McCarthy added that there was only one British clinic, the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London, where Ms Neill's eggs are stored, which was permitted to freeze them. But its director, Mohammed Taranissi, has always been refused permission to use them for treatment. The centre is one of the country's most successful for live births following IVF treatment and Dr Taranissi is pursuing a legal attempt to overrule the HFEA's restrictions. An appeal on a previous ruling is expected to be completed early next year. It is not known whether Ms Neill is prepared to launch her own high court battle, should Dr Taranissi's attempt fail. Last night, Ms Neill refused to comment, but, in a BBC interview, she said: \"I feel very cross. It should be down to Dr Taranissi and myself to discuss what we should do, not the government to have a law that is cut and dried. If you are allowed to do one stage, why not the end stage? \"Physically I'm getting older and I know that some time in the near future I would like to consider using the eggs and it will be all down to the government whether I'll be able to do it and when I'll be able to do it,\" she said. \"I just felt it had been a waste of time. That hope was gone all of a sudden. But I know that Dr Taranissi and other clinics are fighting for the law to be changed.\" Dr Taranissi said: \"It is very sad to find out that this technique is now being provided successfully in the United States and various parts of Europe and the Far East but banned in the United Kingdom which presented IVF to the world some 20 years ago.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/dec/16/alqaida.terrorism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-16T02:31:29Z","webTitle":"Bin Laden link alleged to gang held in Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/16/alqaida.terrorism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/16/alqaida.terrorism","fields":{"headline":"Bin Laden link alleged to gang held in Jordan","bodyText":"Jordan yesterday said it had arrested 13 people suspected of planning \"terrorist\" attacks in the kingdom after undergoing explosives training in Afghanistan. The disclosure came a day after the US repeated warnings of possible attacks on American citizens abroad by followers of Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi Islamist living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban authorities. Such warnings have become routine, especially during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began 13 days ago, and it is not clear whether those arrested had links to Bin Laden, who is wanted by the US for the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year, in which 220 people died, most of them Africans. But the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said in confirming the arrests by the Jordanians, \"We certainly believe these were members of Bin Laden's organisation that posed a threat to Americans. \"We are following closely a number of threats and continue to be very vigilant on that front.\" The foreign office in London said yesterday it would not be issuing a similar warning about threats to British citizens abroad. Jordan's prime minister, Abur-Rauf Rawabdeh, told parliament in Amman that those arrested had entered the country on forged Jordanian and other Middle Eastern passports. \"The security forces have arrested a group of Jordanians returning from Afghanistan with an Iraqi and an Algerian... who planned to carry out operations on the Jordanian arena,\" he said. He made no reference to Bin Laden or his Islamist group, al-Qaeda, but said those arrested had received military training in camps in Afghanistan. Three members of the ring, planning to carry out attacks \"against several Jordanian sites and Jordanian personal ities\", were at large outside the country, he said. The White House said on Tuesday that Michael Sheehan, head of the state department's counter-terrorism unit, had met a Taliban representative in New York and warned him that \"any terrorist activities by the Bin Laden group, we would hold the Taliban responsible\". The Taliban yesterday claimed their \"guest\", who roams Afghanistan with his armed followers, was barred from political or military activity. \"This is part of worldwide American government propaganda against the Taliban. It [the warning] is baseless,\" the foreign minister, Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, said. \"We want to reassure the world and Americans at large about this and reiterate our proposal to monitor his [Bin Laden's] movements.\" However, diplomats based in Amman have recently expressed worries that Arabs based in Afghanistan are increasingly using Jordan as a transit route to other countries in the region. During the 1980s, hundreds of Arabs joined the jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan - including Bin Laden, who came offering large sums of cash and his services as an engineer. He was among the many trained at a camp near the eastern town of Khost, the target of a US missile attack against Bin Laden last year. After the war with the Russians, many Arab militants settled in Afghanistan and continued to enjoy the protection of Afghan commanders. Several of those commanders are now part of the ruling Taliban regime. During the early 1990s, Arab militants also ran what was in effect a parallel administration in northern Kunar, and the area is believed to be home to a heavily fortified camp, equipped with satellite dishes and the latest communications equipment, that has been frequented by Bin Laden. Speculation about his militant network is inevitable - especially in Pakistan, where the arrest of any Arab national is regularly linked to Bin Laden, and where his ability to evade his pursuers has transformed him into a hero. In the 16 months since the US missile strike, Osama Bin Laden's fame has grown. Many shops in Pakistan's border city of Peshawar, where Arab militants once gathered to join the fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, now pay homage to him with signs bearing his name. There is even a privately owned Osama bus line. Others have paid their respects by naming their babies Osama. Yesterday, authorities in Peshawar confirmed they had also arrested a Jordanian national on Monday. They gave no reason for his detention, but the local press immediately claimed he was a Bin Laden follower. Reassurances from the Taliban are unlikely to be taken seriously amid growing impatience in Washington at its refusal to hand over Bin Laden for trial. On Tuesday even Pakistan, whose intelligence agencies helped create the Taliban and which is one of only three countries to recognise its government in Kabul, bowed to pressure from Washington. The central bank ordered the freezing of all Taliban assets - an act that is far more punitive than the sanctions which were imposed by the United Nations in November. The freeze on assets will make it impossible for the Taliban to afford the purchases of Pakistani wheat which the militia has been distributing to government employees struggling to survive on average salaries of $4 a month. Meanwhile, the US embassy in Cambodia said yesterday it had suspended an alert after failing to uncover evidence to support reports last month that Bin Laden was planning a terrorist attack on the embassy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/16/bulger.jackstraw","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-16T17:25:41Z","webTitle":"Full text: Jack Straw's Common's statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/16/bulger.jackstraw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/16/bulger.jackstraw","fields":{"headline":"Full text: Jack Straw's Common's statement","bodyText":"Madam speaker, this morning the European court of human rights announced its judgement in the case brought against the UK government by Robert Thompson and John Venables. A copy of the judgement has been placed in the library. These two youths were responsible for the appalling murder of James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993. The whole house and country has the deepest sympathy for James' parents. As Lord Reed, one of court's judges said \"the grief of James Bulger's parents, who took part in the proceedings before the court, is inexpressible. The fact that [those responsible]\u0085 were themselves only 10 years old at the time of the murder makes it particularly disturbing anyway.\" Madam speaker, the authority of the European court of human rights derives from our membership of the council of Europe. The council of Europe was established after the war on the initiative of the allies, especially the United Kingdom. It now has 41 nations in membership. The council of Europe predates the European Union and is wholly separate from it. The European convention on human rights is a convention of the council of Europe, and the court of human rights one of its principal institutions. It was British jurists who played a leading role in drafting the convention. The United Kingdom was the first nation to ratify it in 1951. Successive United Kingdom governments ever since have consistently abided by the decisions of the court, introducing amending legislation through this parliament where necessary. In the case which Robert Thompson and John Venables brought before the Strasbourg court, the two youth essentially argued that facing trial in a crown court, and having their tariff set by the home secretary were inappropriate given their ages. They claimed that these arrangements breached articles 3,5,6 and 14 relating to powers of detention and the right to a fair trial. They were 11 at the time of conviction and are now 17. The House will understand that I have had only a short time to read the judgement, but the key findings are as follows: There were no violations of the European convention on human rights in respect of • Article 3, the right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, in respect of both trial and sentence. In particular the court held as lawful the age of 10 as the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales. They were also of the view \"that the particular features of the trial process did not cause to a significant degree, suffering going beyond that which would inevitably have been engendered by any attempt by the authorities to deal with the applicants.\" • Article 5(1), the right to liberty, where the court held that the sentence of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure was clearly lawful under English law and was not arbitrary. There had not, therefore, been any violation of article 5(1) The court did find violations in respect of • Article 6 (1), the right to a fair trial; and • under articles 6(1) and 5(4) relating to the setting of the tariffs and their continued review. On article 6(1), the right to a fair trial, the court found that not withstanding the special arrangements which had been made to help ensure that the youths could properly participate in the trial process in the crown court, \"it was highly unlikely that that either applicant would have felt sufficiently uninhibited, in the tense court room and under public scrutiny, to have consulted with their legal representatives during the trial or, indeed, that, given their immaturity and disturbed emotional state they would have been capable outside the court room of co-operating with their lawyers and giving them information for the purposes of their defence.\" It followed that the applicants had been denied a fair hearing in breach of article 6(1). On the setting of tariffs and their continued review, the court held that there was a fundamental distinction between the sentence for murder in respect of juveniles and that for murder in respect of adults. So far as the latter is concerned, the European court in an earlier judgement [Wynne 1994] had accepted the lawfulness of the mandatory life sentence for adults convicted of murder in the courts of England and Wales. However, in this case, the European court followed a decision of the House of Lords judicial committee that the setting of tariffs for juveniles was itself a sentencing exercise. Since the home secretary, who set the applicant's tariffs, was clearly not independent of the executive, there had been a breach of article 6(1) in respect of the determination of the applicant's tariffs. On article 5(4), the court held that because the applicants tariffs had been decided upon by the home secretary, there had been no judicial supervision incorporated in the initial fixing of their sentences. The court therefore found a violation of article 5(4), based on \"the lack of any opportunity for them to have the lawfulness of their detention assessed by a judicial body. In summary madam speaker, the court has therefore found in favour of the UK government on two important issues. These are that Robert Johnson and John Venables were never subjected to inhumane or degrading treatment by the government; and that the sentences imposed by the court were not inconsistent with the requirements of that convention But it has found against the UK on issues relating to the trial process; the way in which the tariff linked to their sentence was set; and the failure subsequently to review the tariff. This judgement does not overturn the verdict of murder in this case, nor does it in any way exonerate the two youths for their part in this terrible crime. This judgement does not direct their release from custody. The parole board remains responsible for deciding release in these cases. As with any such decision of the court, Her Majesty's government accepts its judgement. But, in all, the judgement ran to 120 pages it is important that we proceed as expeditiously as possible, but with care. Madam speaker, the House will understand that I need to study the detail of what the court has said and fully to consider its implications. I will of course report the outcome of my considerations to Parliament as soon as possible. It will of course be for this parliament to agree any change in the legislative framework for dealing with juvenile offenders in these circumstances. The appalling murder of James Bulger, a two-year-old, murdered by two ten-year-olds, profoundly shocked the country and continues to do so. But the real agony is felt by James's parents. It is they who have endured, and will continue to endure, the profound grief of losing their son, a fact which nothing can ever repair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/dec/17/features11.g23","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-17T00:52:11Z","webTitle":"Out on a limb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/dec/17/features11.g23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/dec/17/features11.g23","fields":{"headline":"Out on a limb","bodyText":"We turned off the highway on to a dirt track, on the trail of the rarest bird in the world. The earth was stony and reddish; the landscape typical of this remote, drought-infested corner of north-east Brazil - low, wiry trees and fierce-looking cacti. We got out of our car and crept quietly to the bank of a small river, where a few tall caraibeira trees emerged from the bank. A camouflaged hutch about a metre high and a metre wide had been cobbled together from branches and leaves. The guide, the photographer and I squashed in and started our vigil. Shortly after dawn, right on time, we heard a distinctive caw. The guide, a biology student, caught my eye excitedly. Then an elegant blue parrot alighted on the caraibeira opposite. For about 20 minutes it watched us watching it, before it slipped into its nest in the tree's hollow trunk. In the animal kingdom there can be few sights as poignant. The bird, a Spix's macaw, is one of a kind, the sole member of its species left in the wild. Thanks to the predatory habits of humans - who reduced its habitat through colonisation and then captured the birds for private aviaries - the remaining male Spix's macaw that lives near Curaça, 1,300 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, is the last step before extinction. To paraphrase Monty Python, the species is almost no more. It is almost an ex-species. Its unique, exaggerated situation, however, has made the parrot an international cause célèbre. It has become a symbol for nature conservation and the battle against animal trafficking. The lonesome Spix's is possibly one of the most closely observed living things. Four people are employed full-time to observe the bird during all daylight hours. They make a log of its movements every two minutes. Local people, most living in extreme poverty and many barely literate, keep notes of whenever they see the bird flying nearby. \"People always ask why we have all of this just to save one bird. But it's a call to arms,\" says Yara Barros, in-field coordinator of the Spix's Macaw Project, who has spent most days of the past three years huddled in the wooden cabin looking out for her blue-feathered friend. \"It's an alert to the world about how close to extinction you can get. The Spix's is a figurehead.\" Macaws are the long-tailed poster-birds of the parrot family. Living in a region stretching from Mexico to Argentina, they are an emblem of the American tropics. But their beauty has been their downfall. Thousands have been captured for the international trade in wild animals, now considered the third largest illegal market after drugs and guns. Of the 16 species left, nine are considered at risk of extinction. The Spix's is the smallest of the three blue macaw types - in Brazil it is known as the ararinha azul (little blue macaw). It has never been seen in large numbers, and it is perhaps fitting that the man who in 1819 gave the macaw its name, Austrian naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix, only did so after he had shot one down. Even before traffickers began stalking them, the population is assumed to have been about 60. For almost a century after the Austrian visited Brazil, none were seen, and by the 1980s, naturalists assumed that the only Spix's alive were the handful kept in private zoos. Then, in 1990, a Brazilian farmer from near Curaça turned up with photographs of a bird - its long tail dark blue and its head bluey-white. The excitement in ornithological circles was so great that the Permanent Committee to Save the Spix's Macaw - set up the previous year to link owners of the 15 birds in captivity - set up a base camp in the Brazilian outback. Since then, the project has dedicated itself to researching the bird. The hope is that the Curaça Spix's can be used in a programme to reintroduce other Spix's to the wild. \"This male is the only one who has knowledge of how to survive,\" says Barros. \"He has memory of where there is food, of which cactus to sleep on. \" The project has concentrated on finding the male a family. The soap opera of his marriage guidance and family planning has enthralled bird-lovers, zoologists and environmentalists. The starting point was to find him a wife, and then hope that the couple would produce offspring. Macaws pair for life, but there was a problem - there was an \"other woman\". When the Spix's was discovered in 1990 he already had a girlfriend: a bright green Illiger's macaw. With none of his kin around, he had no choice but to date the nearest species. The odd couple had a typical domestic life. The Spix's would sleep on the central pole of a facheiro cactus - the macaw equivalent of a gated condominium - then fly to meet the Illiger's, who lived in a hole in a tree trunk. The couple would fly together during the day, than at sundown the Spix's would escort his lady back to her tree and then scoot off home to the cactus. Researchers decided nevertheless to find a same-species candidate. They located a female Spix's in Recife, 400 miles away, who had spent seven years in captivity. She was taken to Curaça, where the head biologist gave her a crash course in non-sedentary life, feeding her food from the wild and building up her wing muscles. In March 1995 she was released. The researchers were in two minds about whether to capture the Illiger's, to give the female Spix's a clear run. \"We decided against this because we thought it might disorientate the Spix's,\" says Barros. The result was, at first, very positive. The female Spix's quickly started courting the male, and the two Spix's and the Illiger's went around as a threesome. The honeymoon lasted a month. One day, the female Spix's disappeared. A search party of 30 people failed to find any trace. Only recently has the truth come out - a local cow herder spotted the dead bird but was afraid to say for fear that the project would stop. Researchers devised another tactic. They decided to have faith in the cross-species couple. In 1996, for the first time, the Illiger's laid some eggs. When researchers noticed that one of the eggs was cracking they took it out and analysed it. It contained a hybrid embryo, but it was dead. During the reproductive season of 1997-8, the project took to playing God more directly. The Illiger's produced some eggs, but they were infertile and were replaced with fertilised Illiger's eggs from another couple. Unfortunately, the eggs were eaten by predators. A year ago Barros tried a variation on the theme. She swapped the again-infertile Illiger's-Spix's eggs for wooden eggs for the period of incubation. The Illiger's sat on the eggs and on the day that real eggs would have been due to break, Barros took a pair of newborn Illiger's chicks and sneaked them into the nest when the Illiger's was taking her daily stroll. \"When we had a peek in the nest the next day, it was full of food. In other words, she had accepted it. This couple has parenting skills.\" The pair brought up the chicks and flew with them until they were old enough to leave. Although genetically completely Illinger's, the young birds developed voices identical to that of their foster father, the Spix's. Last year's experiment has led Barros to hope that the same would work with Spix's chicks. The problem is that all the reproducing Spix's couples are in the northern hemisphere and so their reproductive season is six months out of sync. Next year, however, six Spix's are to be moved to an aviary near Curaça to try to induce them to produce young at the correct time. The Spix's-Illiger's couple are still a couple. They still mate, they still fly together and the male still picks her up and drops her off at her home. But he is now about 15 years old. In captivity the species can live to 35, but in the wild the lifespan is thought to be less - and if he dies, the project dies. But recently, another strategy for preservation of the species has emerged. The idea is to train captive birds by keeping them in larger and larger aviaries, feeding them food from the wild, and then eventually releasing them. Two years ago an experiment was started, again using Illiger's as the test. Nine were given a year to adapt to the wild in a Curaça aviary and were then electronically tagged and released. A year later, seven are still alive. The Spix's Macaw Project has not just helped birds. It has transformed the poor, sleepy town of Curaça by providing it with a primary school, renovating the town theatre and giving it a sense of pride. Children parade dressed as Spix's macaws. \"Without the support of the local population, the project would never work. We rely on people to keep monitoring the bird when she is flying a long way from the nest,\" says Alexander Gomes, the field assistant. One 51-year-old cattle rancher has started to carve models of the bird and writes poetry in its honour. Another, Jorge de Sousa Rosa, 42, has swapped his life as a herder to be one of the full-time team of birdwatchers. \"I like sitting here all day,\" he says. \"I want to keep up with everything he does. When I was a teenager I remember about 10 of them flying around here. I also remember the traffickers who came. We didn't realise how valuable the birds were.\" Barros adds: \"It's great that we have taught people that it is important to keep a species alive. The first time I saw him the first sensation I had was fear. You see how fragile the situation is. But, at the same time, he was first spotted nine years ago and he's still here. There is hope.\" Sick as a parrot? A little lonely perhaps, and possibly tired of being snooped on constantly, but for once it can take heart that the human race is on its side. On the edge: the world's rarest species by Esther Addley Crested ibis A National Treasure in Japan and Korea, the crested ibis once nested over large areas of mainland Asia and Japan, declining dramatically as a result of the destruction of its pine woodland habitat and the use of pesticides in rice paddies and marshlands. It was also widely hunted for its distinctive plumage. A maximum of 22 individuals has been counted. Florida panther A medium-sized sub-species of the cougar or mountain lion, only 30-50 Florida panthers survive in the state's southern tip. While habitat loss has certainly harmed the population, the most significant threat to the species is its tiny gene pool. Inbreeding has resulted in reduced fertility and cardiac abnormalities within the population. The panther is distinguished by a whorl of hair in the middle of its back and a crook at the end of its long tail. Pinta Galapagos turtle \"Lonesome George\", the last surviving member of this sub-species of giant Galapagos turtle, was discovered on Pinta island in the Galapagos archipelago during a 1972 expedition when he was remarkably almost mistaken for a goat. Despite a $10,000 reward for the discovery of a female, no mate has been found for George, now a resident celebrity at the Charles Darwin research centre. Thought to be about 80 years old, he is still in his prime. Kouprey The kouprey, a forest ox native to Cambodia, Vietnam and eastern Thailand, was first \"discovered\" in 1937 - not in its home environment but in Vincennes Zoo in Paris where the zoo director realised that the calf sent from Saigon was not the beast he expected. By 1970 the newly-identified species was feared to be extinct, but in 1986 an AP reporter travelling in the jungle with Khmer Rouge guerrillas rediscovered the ox when he was served it for supper by his hosts. Grey and shaggy with a long dewlap hanging from its throat, the kouprey is an ancient ancestor of the domestic cow, and cross-breeding could have huge genetic value to cattle species. There may be only a few dozen left, however. Northern hairy-nosed wombat A marsupial with a backward- facing pouch, the wombat's population is now confined to 65 individuals in central Queensland. Their decline is mostly due to competition with cattle, rabbits and sheep and until recently it was also widely hunted for its fur. Extensive conservation efforts are now underway, although DNA tests have revealed that the current population has only 41% of the genetic pool of the extinct species, suggesting it may be in terminal decline."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/20/paulbrown.kevinmaguire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-20T01:38:00Z","webTitle":"N-plant cuts put safety at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/20/paulbrown.kevinmaguire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/20/paulbrown.kevinmaguire","fields":{"headline":"N-plant cuts put safety at risk","bodyText":"Nuclear power station chiefs have been accused by government inspectors of jeopardising safety by shedding staff to cut costs. Leaked British Energy reports reveal that the privatised operator was in dispute with the state-run nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) while a series of incidents repeatedly shut down various of its eight reactors. An internal company report marked \"secret\" discloses that the inspectorate had demanded a halt to redundancies, complaining that too many cheaper contractors without adequate training and skills were being used to replace in-house teams. A second British Energy paper, headed \"confidential\", details more than a dozen cases, including fires and a hydrogen coolant leak, that triggered shutdowns or forced managers to switch off reactors. A reactor at the Hunterston plant automatically shut down on November 9 when a gear motor caught fire. Since the list was drawn up, faulty welding on boiler tubes in Kent's troubled Dungeness B reactor forced it to be shut down. British Energy, which made £298m profit last year, issued a statement to the Stock Exchange this month saying unplanned shutdowns had cut production and expected revenue. Publication of the company's documents will fuel fears about the way the nuclear industry is being run since some of it was privatised. Nuclear inspectors were alerted to the dangers of British Energy's staff cuts by problems uncovered last year at the vast Dounreay fast breeder complex in Scotland. A damning report into Dounreay, operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, warned that the loss of skilled personnel and their replacement by contractors posed a serious risk, and UKAEA was forced to re-employ staff it had let go. The leaked British Energy documents suggest the privatised nuclear industry is now suffering similar problems. One company manager has admitted some staff are on duty \"significantly in excess of the basic working week\" and a new relationship is needed with contractors. British Energy, which was created last year by the merger of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, operates Britain's seven advanced gas-cooled reactors - Heysham 1 and 2, Hinkley Point B, Dungeness B, Hunterston B, Hartlepool and Torness - and the new pressurised water reactor Sizewell B, in Suffolk. Eighteen hundred jobs have been shed since privatisation was announced in 1995, in a cost-cutting drive known as \"management of change\" which has reduced the workforce to 5,389. Leaked notes of a board meeting in October show that Peter Hollins, British Energy's chief executive, and the other directors opposed 18 of the 103 recommendations made by the nuclear inspectorate, accusing the NII of being \"factually wrong\" on some issues. It agreed with only 50 of the recommendations and had qualifications about another 35. But at the same time staff cuts meant some staff were working as many as seven shifts per week instead of the normal five with all the potential consequences that tired workers pose to safety standards. The 18 NII recommendations disputed by the company in its \"secret\" report on how to deal with inspectorate will give cause for concern. As well as an end to planned reductions in in-house staff, the NII recommended more \"mentoring\" of recruits, and a list of tasks to be undertaken only by British Energy staff, as well as a review of future work loads. The inspectors want fresh measures to ensure any contractors are as good as the people they replaced and are properly supervised. And British Energy is urged to recreate the expertise in radiation chemistry it has given up. The NII report is to be published next month and British Energy says it had now conceded all the points made by the NII and reached agreement. Yet internal papers show that on November 3 British Energy still opposed a call to \"stop the planned reduction of in-house staff numbers until it can demonstrate that the new management of change procedure will not adversely affect the safety of nuclear plants\". The drive to cut costs - including £25m from a business support review - even threatens to close visitor centres and free bus trips for school children that were once seen as vital in winning over public opinion. The leaked table showing how stations performed during the 13 weeks from August 16 to November 14 lists a series of cases when staff were required to shut down reactors or the reactors were shut down automatically when something went wrong. Since then Dungeness station has shut completely because of a weld defect and needs inpsectors' permission before it can reopen. This forced the company to alert the Stock Exchange that its predicted revenue may be down for this year. A senior electricity industry source claimed: \"It's only a matter of time before something serious happens if we carried on like this. Stations can only operate safely if we have sufficient numbers of trained staff to carry out safety checks. \"We all want British Energy to be a successful company and have raised our concerns internally, but at times it feels as if we are being ignored.\" Ministers remain publicly committed to selling 49 per cent of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), responsible for the older magnox nuclear stations and the Sellafield reprocessing plant, before the next election. This autumn the NII responded to an increase of safety incidents at the Cumbrian site by sending in a team of 13 inspectors to check that lack of experienced staff at BNFL was not contributing to the problem. This report is expected to be published in the next month. The increase in the number of \"incidents\" and the leaked reports will heighten pressure for tougher guarantees on safety including pledges that staff will not be shed to boost profits of shareholders. Catalogue of closures The leaked British Energy performance table marked \"confidential\" for the 13 weeks from August 16 to November 14 details a series of incidents: Sizewell B: Automatic safety shutdown of a reactor was triggered on August 14 when the coolant pumps suffered a drop in power. The problem was solved on August 17. Dungeness B: Reactor automatically shut down on August 28 when a motor developed a fault in a boiler pump. The reactor went back on stream seven days later when the motor was replaced. Hartlepool: Reactor output reduced on August 23 and 24, then again on October 17 for condenser tube repairs. Heysham 1: Reactor automatically shut down on November 6 when a control rod was being changed was not returned to service for 22 hours. Heysham 2: Reactor shut down on July 16 for turbine repairs and investigation of vibrations. Attempt to return to service on November 6 aborted during run up when blades suffered damage. Reactor had to be shut down on October 20 within an hour of resuming after a six-week maintenance following a pilot exciter fire. A replacement was fitted and it returned to service on October 23 having remained critical. Torness: Reactor fuel reloading on October 29 aborted after turbo-generator hydrogen cooler leak and it was shut down for repairs from November 7 to 14. Hinkley Point B: Reactor output limited to seal a steam leak after it automatically shut down on October 2 following eight-week service. Reactor automatically shut down on October 16 for six days due to \"instability\" of feed system. Reactor shut down on November 10 after a hydrogen leak into the water system. Hunterston: Reactor shut down for five days from August 12 to fix a boiler tube leak and output was limited by turbine bearing vibration. Reactor automatically shut down on November 9 after loss of a gas circulator saw low lubricating oil pressure and a gear motor caught fire. Dungeness B: (Since the original list was compiled.) Both reactors shut down for more than a month after faulty weld was discovered in pressurised steam pipes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/1999/dec/20/futureofthenhs.health","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-20T17:14:39Z","webTitle":"Fit to spend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/dec/20/futureofthenhs.health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/1999/dec/20/futureofthenhs.health","fields":{"headline":"Fit to spend","bodyText":"Health secretary Alan Milburn will today affirm the government's commitment to paying for the National Health Service out of tax. His speech has seasonable significance. Winter is when the NHS as well as its patients look wan. But are the inevitable \"the NHS is ailing\" stories genuine? Four months after the NHS was set up, health minister Nye Bevan told the cabinet the £176m allocation for the first nine months of the NHS needed to be increased by £50m. Half a century on, the problem persists. After the comprehensive spending review, Gordon Brown announced an increase of £21bn for the NHS over the three years to 2001. During this period, the average annual volume spending on the NHS is 3.08%, which is the largest since 1971. But a 3% year on year average increase is only marginally more than the general trend growth of the economy as a whole. At the end of the planning period, the United Kingdom will still be lagging some way behind most other members of the OECD, the advanced countries' club, in terms of the proportion of GDP devoted to organised healthcare. In 1998/99 the UK spent £46.2bn on the NHS. Total health spending including private expenditure accounts for 6.9% of GDP. The doctors, represented by the British Medical Association, argue that if we wanted to match the OECD average on healthcare (about 7.7% of GDP), we would need to spend an additional £8.4bn. But are such proportions a sensible way of deciding how much to spend? They might be if it was clear that more spent on health resulted in better health. However, although the NHS spends less than some other advanced countries, our health outcomes compare favourably. Belgium and the United States have higher levels of spending yet worse health outcomes, judged by life expectancy. Other countries which spend more have similar health outcomes. Of course many factors influence such broad output measures as life expectancy or infant mortality, but the point is that there is no obvious correlation between healthcare spending and health, as the chart shows. There is increasing evidence that the NHS compares well not just in terms of effectiveness and equity, but also in terms of efficiency. The cost of healthcare for a family of four in the NHS has been estimated to be £2,090 a year, with the equivalent cost in the private sector being £8,060 a year - almost four times as much. Administration costs are higher in private systems - 26% of total American hospital costs compared with between 2% and 6% here. High health spending in for example France is also symptomatic of widespread inefficiencies. French patients can see as many GPs as they like, can refer themselves to specialists and as a result consume five times as many drugs as their UK counterparts. To argue that we should spend more on our healthcare system just because our neighbours do, is, as any parent knows, a very weak argument. A more rational approach is to look at the gap between health needs and supply. Some analysts say it is widening; we therefore need to control costs by limiting supply, by reducing or diverting demand for services or by introducing alternative funding mechanisms. Demand is allegedly rising due to technological developments, patients' increased expectations, and demographic changes. But each of these assertions is open to question. New technologies may increase some costs but reduce others. An example here is day case surgery. The consequences of an ageing population for the NHS have been exaggerated. In countries as diverse as Denmark and the US there is no correlation between a large elderly population and an increase in healthcare costs. The number of elderly people in our society is much less significant than their health status. Commentators like to point to increasing patient expectations and demand as further evidence that the NHS in its current form is unsustainable. However, the recent experience of Viagra would suggest that the relationship between supply and demand is far more complex than most commentators appreciate. The drug was greeted with hysterical predictions of the NHS being unable to cope with demand - yet this nightmare scenario failed to materialise. The demand for Viagra has been one-100th of what was predicted. An initial diagnosis suggests that while perhaps a bit run down, with tendencies towards hypochondria, there is nothing seriously wrong with the long-term health of the NHS. In terms of treatment, it would no doubt benefit from additional resources, but the NHS is not the only input into the production of better health. Additional money might be better spent on housing, education and employment opportunities, if the aim is to improve the health of the nation. The problem is that the NHS is surrounded by vested interests on all sides. The private sector hovers like a greedy but distant relative, seizing on every little hiccup as evidence of its imminent demise. The media, like gossipy neighbours, exaggerate every bit of bad news they can find. We need a new kind of antibiotic to tackle the parasites feeding off the failures of the NHS. This will allow us to have a healthy debate about funding, without eroding public and professional confidence in one of our most valued institutions. • Joanne Lenaghan is a health specialist at the Institute for Public Policy Research"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/21/food.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-21T01:45:24Z","webTitle":"New research raises CJD fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/21/food.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/21/food.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"New research raises CJD fears","bodyText":"Scientists today produced the most compelling evidence yet that mad cow disease can affect humans - increasing fears that the British population is at risk. Experiments with mice showed that the cattle disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and new variant CJD are almost certainly caused by the same infectious agent. The results, reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that BSE and nvCJD are interchangeable. The findings were that \"a large section of the United Kingdom population may be at considerable risk\". So far 48 people have died from the disease, which is always fatal, but because of its long incubation period it has been impossible to say how many of the millions who ate infected beef would be affected. The scientists, led by Michael Scott from the university of California, San Francisco, and Robert Will at the government's CJD surveillance unit at Western general hospital in Edinburgh, conducted experiments with mice genetically engineered to produce the same prions naturally found in cows. They noted that most experts thought the sudden ap pearance of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 1996 - a new form of the human brain disease with distinct characteristics - was the result of people eating BSE-infected beef. It was thought that both diseases were caused by rogue \"prion\" proteins that may have jumped the species barrier into humans. However, the hypothesis has never been conclusively proved, and since the scare began scientists have sought hard evidence to back the theory. The researchers discovered, not unexpectedly, that there was no \"species barrier\" between the mice and cows. Diseased brain tissue injected into the mice produced symptoms in 250 days, the same incubation period experienced by cattle with BSE. A second group of mice given prions from the first group became sick in virtually the same period of time. The big surprise came when human brain tissue infected with the prions that cause new variant CJD was injected into the mice. Again there was no apparent sign of a species barrier. New variant CJD had the same incubation period in the mice as BSE, and produced an identical pattern of brain damage. The results suggested that BSE and nvCJD were interchangeable. Introduced into transgenic mice, nvCJD prions assumed an identity \"indistinguishable from BSE prions\". The scientists wrote: \"That human nvCJD prions so precisely duplicate the properties of native bovine BSE prions in their behaviour on transmission into ... transgenic mice creates a compelling argument for an etiological link between BSE and nvCJD. \"Although earlier proposals of an etiological link between BSE and nvCJD were disquieting, the investigations reported here raise greater concern that a large section of the UK population may be at considerable risk.\" The experiments do not indicate how many people are at risk because the mice were modified to eliminate the species barrier which, in practice, does exist between cows and humans. The mice were also highly susceptible to infection with the sheep prion disease scrapie, although this produced a different biological pattern. Scientists suspect that BSE may have originated in cattle as a result of feeding them sheep remains infected with scrapie. In report published today the researchers suggested that transgenic \"bovine prion\" mice could be used to check the potential of scrapie to produce BSE in cattle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/1999/dec/21/2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-21T11:18:00Z","webTitle":"Brits lead Golden Globe nominations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/dec/21/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/dec/21/2","fields":{"headline":"Brits lead Golden Globe nominations","bodyText":"American Beauty, the debut film of British theatre director Sam Mendes, leads the field after the shortlist for the Golden Globes awards was unveiled yesterday - it secured six nominations, including best picture and best director.

Lara Croft gets real Cyberexplorer Lara Croft is inching her way to the big screen: Variety reports today that Paramount Pictures is in advanced negotiations to enlist Simon West to direct Tomb Raider, an action film based on the popular video game. The series has become one of the most popular video games of all time, thanks to the \"charms\" of the feisty Ms Croft, a kind of female James Bond. Sources say that the screenplay - which bears similarities to Raiders of the Lost Ark - remains the stumbling block, but West's arrival may soon change that. The picture is on Paramount's fast track - though certainly not a track fast enough for a summer 2000 release, the date for which the picture was originally slated. Matrix producer tells of animated prequel Not only will there be a Matrix 2 and 3, but it seems a Matrix minus 1 could also be hitting our screens. Producer Joel Silver says in an interview with Empire magazine that the Wachowksi brothers \"have a story that essentially gets us from our world today to the world of The Matrix. We're talking about dealing with that story in animation, because it would be really impractical to shoot a war between man and machine in live action. \"We're very excited also about our web activity.

The self-styled Father Geek, an assistant at New Line Cinema, has heard \"first-hand who is being cast\" in a Dirty Dancing sequel. And about time too we say. Sadly, Jennifer Grey will not be reprising her role as the bizarrely named Baby. Instead, Natalie Portman is \"all but signed to star as the lead girl\". However, production will need to be finished by July 1 - when Portman is scheduled to start shooting Star Wars Episode 2. But the US actress, who is a huge fan of the original Dirty Dancing movie, might even ask Lucas to reschedule the beginning of her dates in Episode 2 to accommodate her appearance in DD2. Mad Max 4 in the pipeline George Miller, talking to Australia's The Age newspaper, revealed details of a fourth Mad Max movie. The producer-writer-director said that the film will not however be a sequel: \"I don't think we can make Mad Max 4 without making a progression, but I still definitely see it, after all this time, as a stand-alone film.\" Miller also explained why now is the time for another Max flick, saying: \"One of the reasons for doing the film is that there is a new dispensation in film-making, and that is CGI. Working on the Babe films and seeing what you can do now in the digital realm makes the Mad Max films a whole new ball game.\" In brief \u0095 Today it's the turn of Associated Press' entertainment writers to come up with their top 10 movies of the decade.

Maybe the Glasgow novelist Alasdair Gray coined it back in 1983, when he used it as epigraph to a book. Maybe - because he says he pinched it \"from a Canadian poet\". But Gray is a tricksy fellow and might be fibbing. The question is what this proverb is worth today. When it was coined - or forged - Scotland was soggy with gloom after the failed 1979 devolution referendum. Now Scotland is self-governing. It is early days, but how much better is the nation? The Scottish parliament has just packed it in for the holidays. The 129 MSPs, more than a third of them women, have been legislating for six months since the Queen opened the parliament on July 1. It has been a rough ride, a steeplechase over unexpected and occasionally terrifying events. The MSPs were all learners, even - as it turned out - snooty old Westminster hands who fancied they knew it all. The first surprise was the media. Having spent decades clamouring for devolution, the \"unreconstructed wankers\" (Tony Blair's term for Scottish journalists) greeted the parliament with merciless contempt. Only three weeks after the elections, one paper was asking how the parliament \"had sunk so far so fast - deeply disappointing and depressing\". The MSPs, most of whom had never faced sustained criticism in their lives, began their debates in shock. The parliament has done some independent things and is now said to be planning to defy Westminster over student fees. It also did so over beef on the bone and aid for farmers; Scotland's freedom of information law will be bolder than the English one and, for better or worse, hunting may be banned earlier. The parliament's final act before dispersing last week was to call - unanimously - for the scrapping of the act of settlement, the squalid old relic which bans Catholics from the British throne. This was exhilarating: not just because London was furious and not just because devolution gives Edinburgh no right to touch such ancient fetishes, but because the parliament had the backing of the traditionally anti-Catholic Church of Scotland. That \"better nation\" showed for a defiant moment. But old ways persist. The Ruddle scandal in August - the release of a psychopathic killer on a technicality - revealed that Scotland's lawmakers and judges are not properly separate but a single cosy clique. Next came the \"Lobbygate\" crisis, showing that Scotland's new government was easy meat for well-connected influence-peddlers. The media had to batter the executive into holding a special inquiry, which then tried to betray all its pledges to \"openness\" by sitting in secret. It was soon forced to take evidence in public. But the uproar had a sensational outcome. A judge, Lord Johnston, pronounced that a court could oblige the parliament to honour its own commitments - in this case, to act in public. Out went the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In came the European assumption that constitutional law is the supreme authority in the land: \"Lex Rex\", as the Scots used to say. How long can two totally contradictory philosophies of power co-exist in one United Kingdom? And then in December came the Kevin Rafferty affair. Donald Dewar, Scotland's first minister, was forced to drop his chief of staff, an agile New Labour spin doctor who had kept the shaky Lib-Lab governing coalition on the road. Ostensibly, Rafferty had spun a false web about death threats to Susan Deacon, health minister, from anti-abortionists. In reality, Rafferty's fall was engineered by old Labour rivals jealous of his links to Millbank. The New Labour culture of venomous secret briefing against colleagues has infected Edinburgh, while the media - who raised an absurd screaming for Donald Dewar's removal - are becoming prisoners of exactly the \"lobby\" type of news management which the Scottish parliament intended to ban. Some people assumed that rows about money would lead rapidly to the break-up of Britain. But so far the threats to the devolution settlement are political more than financial. Above all, they come from Millbank's neurotic hankering to control what Scottish Labour does in the Scottish executive. Every London tug at Donald Dewar's reins puts intense pressure on the fragile Edinburgh coalition partners, the Scottish Liberal Democrats. So far, most Scots still seem to despise both the idea and the reality of coalition. This is by far the most serious failure of devolution. As a member of the Consultative Steering Group, the journalist Joyce Macmillan was strongly in favour of a new, power-sharing political process. But she told a Glasgow conference the other day: \"I can't over-emphasize the hostility I meet to the coalition idea, to the fudging of policies and manifestos\". The Lib Dems are perceived - unfairly - to have sold out their election commitment to abolish university tuition fees in order to get into bed with Labour. At the Hamilton by-election in September, their vote went into free fall, hitting bottom at 3%. The parliament itself is popular. And yet the system on which it rests - proportional voting leading to coalition governments - is resented. This is an ugly paradox, and the temptation is to say that the Scottish executive could regain public trust if it had more power to act independently. That is the cry of the Scottish National party, the large and formidable opposition. But Edinburgh already has plenty of responsibilities. What's needed is something else. First, that the parliament uses its existing powers more boldly, and tries harder to sell them to the public. Second, that London - whether as the Westminster parliament or as a party headquarters - loses the right to interfere with how the Scots exercise those limited powers. And that requires something like a Scottish Declaration of Rights: in effect, a written constitution. Breathless, the raw MSP recruits have survived this first-session assault course. And Scotland is a better nation - for those who run it or plan to improve it. But not for many ordinary Scottish people. This month has brought shocking poverty statistics about Glasgow, the sour, unchanged reality behind all that \"Miles Better\" branding, behind the new call-centres and shiny retail parks. As Alasdair Gray might say: \"Thousands don't work, and they live in what feels like the last days of a failed nation\". Their parliament has yet to reach them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/1999/dec/22/theatre.artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-22T00:00:00Z","webTitle":"Spiritual uplift","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/1999/dec/22/theatre.artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/1999/dec/22/theatre.artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Spiritual uplift","bodyText":"For a bad moment it looks as if it is all going to be very RSC. There is the doddery old king at the back of the stage, there are his armed guards, and, oh look, here are a couple of messengers from another country with - what is it, a threat? (And delivered in what might well be rhyming couplets, with that odd RSC emphasis on every third word, like a newsreader.) Fortunately, the messenger gets his head cut off and handed back to his mate in a rather nice straw bag, and things just keep getting better. Oroonoko is the story of an African prince. The first part is concerned with his youth and love affair with the lovely princess Imoinda; the second with their capture into slavery and his brave leadership of a revolt. The tale has been intermittently popular ever since it appeared in a novel by the pretty wonderful Aphra Behn. (The first woman playwright, at the end of the 17th century, she was also a spy and a traveller, and spent part of her youth alone in Surinam, where some of the action is set.) It is easy to see why, since it manages to pack in treacherous royal advisers, loyal retainers, travel, beautiful princesses, handsome princes, true love, a bit of torture, and then gets in a few good jokes along the way. Sort of Tosca rolled into The Princess Bride, if you like. Like all the best books, or plays, or films, Oroonoko takes us into another culture and shows us ourselves. By concentrating so much of the first part of the play in the West African kingdom of Coromantien, the adaptor (Biyi Bandele) gives us a context and culture behind the familiar images of the slave trade: we see the poetry and jokes and grace of the home from which the shackled men have been torn. There are funny scenes that make you jolt upright with laughter, and moments where an audience-wide snuffle develops, with much sneaky grabbing for handkerchiefs. I walked out with that odd, uplifted feeling that good drama lends an audience for a time. Perfect, and just in time for Christmas. • In repertory until April.

So far 48 people have died from the disease but research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that \"a large section of the United Kingdom population may be at critical risk\". This comes only days after Lord Phillips concluded his £25m inquiry with the warning that the human death toll from the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disaster could be \"just the tip of the iceberg\". What is significant about the latest findings - more evidence of the link between BSE and nvCJD - is not so much the research itself, which confirms work already done in the UK, but the fact that it marks the retreat of the main critic of the earlier conclusions. Last year Professor Stanley Prusiner, a Nobel prize winner, told the public inquiry into the BSE crisis that he was not convinced that there was any link between the disease and nvCJD. Now he admits he was wrong to cast doubts on the UK research. That gives those sceptical about the seriousness of the disease one less rung to hang on to. It will not be possible to make sensible policy changes until Lord Phillips has delivered his committee's verdict to ministers, which he has to do by March 31. He was asked to find out what went wrong between the identification of an obscure cattle disease in 1986 and the day (March 20, 1996) when the Conservatives admitted that people might be dying because of what they ate. We need to know several things: why the committee of experts took so long to come to the right view; why slaughterhouses behaved in such a cavalier fashion; why the agriculture ministry was cutting back heavily on the scientists it employed during this period; and the implications of Lord Phillips's withering suggestion to the former agriculture minister, John Gummer, that \"policy in relation to BSE was not fundamentally based on science but on a lack of it\". Even now we do not know for certain how the disease crosses from the digestive tract to the nervous system and how it induces madness. If there is a lesson, it is that when faced with a potentially catastrophic disaster like this, government must act with proportional force to counter it. It's too late this time but at least it could make us better prepared against catastrophes of the next century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/1999/dec/23/owenbowcott","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-23T01:38:44Z","webTitle":"Christmas cheer for Morocco's jailed Britons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/23/owenbowcott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/23/owenbowcott","fields":{"headline":"Christmas cheer for Morocco's jailed Britons","bodyText":"There was no cranberry sauce or gravy, but 13 convicted British drug traffickers sat down to an early turkey lunch in Rabat prison this week, raising hopes of an agreement between Morocco and the United Kingdom which would allow inmates to serve out their sentences in their own country. The three hour meal, held in the middle of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, was the first time the British embassy had been able to organise a Christmas party for Britons jailed locally. Nearly 100 other European prisoners and diplomats joined the celebrations inside the compound. There are currently 26 men and two women from Britain in Morocco's prisons. All have been convicted or charged with smuggling cannabis, which grows naturally in North Africa's warm climate. The longest sentence is 10 years. \"I was surprised that everyone came together for Christmas,\" said Nigel Hogben, 36, originally from Camberley and one of the inmates who helped cook the vegetables for the feast on Tuesday. \"It was great. We all got packs of cigarettes and free socks from the Germans. The turkey was brought in ready cooked from a local oven. Sadly, there was no gravy, nor cranberry sauce.\" Conditions have been improving in recent months, said Hogben, who was a gardener in England before being arrested for smuggling. \"I used to be in a cell with 40 other people, then I was moved to one with 17 people, and recently they gave me a cell in which there are only six of us.\" He now has access to a gym and is hoping to be free next September after nearly four years confinement - if his family pays a £1,200 fine. \"The guards behave pretty badly towards their own people, but they treat us as a bank - asking for cigarettes or gifts whenever we receive parcels from home,\" he said. The British ambassador, Anthony Layden, who helped organise the lunch, said that the appointment last year of a new prime minister, Abdulrahman Youssoufi, who is intent on improving human rights, had changed attitudes in Morocco's criminal justice system. \"We are quite a long way down the road towards a prison transfer agreement between our two countries,\" he said. \"That would enable Britons convicted in Morocco to serve most of their sentences back in United Kingdom jails. It would be the first such agreement in the Arab world.\" Exchange agreements already exist with most European countries, the Commonwealth, United States, Canada, Thailand and Venezuela. British embassies have previously held Christmas lunches for British inmates in Bangkok and New Delhi. The charity Prisoners Abroad, which supports Britons jailed overseas, welcomed the move towards a transfer agreement. \"It's much better for families if they can visit prisoners in their own countries and it's much better for rehabilitation,\" said Avan Wadia, an official with the organisation. The director-general of the Moroccan prison service, Mohammed Lididi, has been to London twice, according to the foreign office, to \"make the Moroccan prison regime more humane by introducing British ideas\". But the latest highly critical report by the chief inspector of prisons on conditions at Wandsworth jail, Mr Layden conceded, might not provide the perfect English role model to export abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/23/willwoodward1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-23T13:09:12Z","webTitle":"Jumbo crashes near Stansted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/23/willwoodward1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/23/willwoodward1","fields":{"headline":"Jumbo crashes near Stansted","bodyText":"Accident investigators will today examine the wreckage of a Korean Air jumbo jet which crashed minutes after take-off from Stansted airport last night, killing all four crew members and exploding in a ball of flame which leapt up to 600ft in the air. The Boeing 747 crash-landed in a field on the edge of Hatfield forest, near the village of Great Hallingbury, Essex, and caught fire as it hit power lines. But the cargo plane landed in a sparsely populated area and there were no reports of any casualties on the ground. Hundreds of travellers beginning their Christmas break were left stranded at Stansted airport, which was immediately closed. Commuters faced gridlock on surrounding roads, including the blocked M11 motorway, and there were local power cuts. Witnesses reported a vast orange fireball, and debris was seen falling on to roads and the surrounding areas. Essex fire service battled to deal with a fire in the plane and several isolated fires in the field in which it landed. The plane took off from Stansted at 6.31pm on its way to Malpensa, near Milan, Italy. Two minutes later it crashed about a mile away, near the A120. The cause of the crash, which killed three crew and a maintenance worker, was unknown last night. The airline has a chequered record and is known as one of the world's worst carriers for safety. Last night's incident was the fifth crash in 12 years. Experts from the air accident investigation branch of the department of transport will hold a full-scale investiga tion of the crash and report directly to John Prescott, the environment and transport secretary. Air accident investigators rushed to the scene last night to begin their inquiry. Mr Prescott spoke to the prime minister, Tony Blair, within half an hour of reports of the crash and will visit the scene today. Korean Air, the world's second biggest cargo airline behind the US-based Federal Express, began its Stansted freight operation this year. David Learmount, an aviation expert, said last night the airline had been undergoing a \"safety crisis\" in weeks preceding the crash. Some air crew were suffering \"appalling morale\", he said. \"There have been many former military pilots who were fast-tracked to get right to the top. Many were arrogant and believed they knew it all. This had led to problems with the civilian pilots who were not in the fast track. \"Most of the crews are being retrained by the Americans who are trying to inculcate a safety ethic in an airline which clearly didn't have one.\" In August 1997 a Korean Air Boeing 747 on a flight from Seoul crashed in Guam, killing all but 26 of the 247 passengers and crew on board. Conditions at Stansted last night were wet and drizzly, with wind at an unremarkable 21mph. One eyewitness, Nick Relton, told Channel 4 News: \"I was driving to Stansted airport to meet a friend of mine and I saw an aeroplane take off from Stansted. \"I looked again a couple of seconds later and thought, 'where's that plane gone?' and as I thought that, there was a huge orange explosion, flames leaping probably 500ft-600ft in the air. I've never seen anything like it.\" Ian Pogue had just come off the M11 to the airport when he saw \"a huge ball of red and orange flames. It seemed to last for about five seconds. It just went boom\". Another eyewitness, Andrew Smith, who lives nearby, told BBC radio: \"There was a huge fireball and a massive explosion. My whole house shook. Suddenly all the lights in the area went out, the whole sky was lit up.\" Joseph Tranter, a farmer, described how he looked into the sky to see the plane \"explode like a giant firework\". He said: \"Once the plane came down, a big mushroom cloud erupted into the air like a bomb had gone off in the forest. There were flames leaping up about 300ft into the air - it was an absolute inferno with debris showering everywhere.\" Some inbound passenger flights to Stansted were diverted to Luton and Heathrow airports. More than 100 emergency vehicles attended the crash scene, but the main hospital for Stansted, the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, nine miles away, said it was not expecting to receive any casualties. Kay Hoare told Sky News: \"We just heard a very loud bang and a bright light in the sky and then sparks.\" She said it appeared the plane had been taking off when it crashed in fields between Great Hallingbury and Little Hallingbury near the A120. Another witness, Lawrence Waite, watched from a mile away. \"I couldn't see flames from where I was but there is lots of smoke in the air. There were lots of blue lights and red lights. It seemed like chaos.\" Stansted is the third biggest freight airport in the United Kingdom after Heathrow and Gatwick, handling more than 200,000 metric tonnes of freight a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/1999/dec/24/art.artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-24T00:00:00Z","webTitle":"Millennium revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/1999/dec/24/art.artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/1999/dec/24/art.artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Millennium revelations","bodyText":"Botticelli's Mystic Nativity is, at first glance, the perfect Yuletide image. Available as a Christmas card, it is also being beamed onto the Sainsbury wing facade, glowing over Trafalgar Square. What a shining, festive picture it makes as Mary and Joseph adore the Christ child in a crude wooden hut in a rocky countryside, while tiny mortals hug angels in the foreground and devils disappear into cracks in the ground. Hang on a minute - devils? The National Gallery's seasonal exhibition turns out to be a Christmas parcel with a bomb inside. The Mystic Nativity depicts the end of the world. Dated to 1500, the half-millennium, it has a Greek text in which Botticelli declares that \"I, Sandro, made this picture at the conclusion of the year 1500 in the troubles of Italy in the half time after the time according to the 11th chapter of Saint John in the second woe of the Apocalypse during the loosing of the devil....\". The National Gallery has made a good joke by celebrating it now in a special exhibition. The star of the show is Girolamo Savonarola, the charismatic preacher who convulsed late 15th-century Florence with his fiery words, lashing out at the city's luxury, promising it was about to be swept away by a flood, and the beginning of a New Age. His followers, nicknamed the \"piagnoni\" (cry babies), burnt paintings. One of them appears to have been Botticelli. The show includes a portrait of Savonarola in grimacing, hook-nosed profile, and on the reverse his execution (he was burned at the stake in 1498). The exhibition, drawing on late paintings by Botticelli and his illustrations to Dante, claims the Mystic Nativity reproduces images from Savonarola's apocalyptic writings. Botticelli was the most graceful painter of the Florentine Renaissance and his early paintings - currently starring in the National Gallery's exhibition on 1470s Florence - dream of a perfect humanist world: Venus and Mars shows War asleep in Love's arms, a vision of peace on earth. The Mystic Nativity is a vision of peace on earth too, but it comes in a moment of crisis: the Nativity unlocks the prophecy in Revelations and human history ends in \"rapture\". Botticelli's angels, spinning into paradise, are ecstatic; revolution hits the Holy Land. The Mystic Nativity is like a late medieval altarpiece in which the mortals are smaller than the holy family. Botticelli deliberately rejects perspective, destabilising the painting, destroying pictorial order to make this a moment of absolute transformation. The Mystic Nativity is a reminder that millenarian change has not always been about sponsor-friendly domes. It used to be about revelation and revolution.

Kevin Smith, the accomplished indie director of slacker masterpieces like Clerks and Mallrats, and now Dogma, his new satire on Christianity and the Roman Catholic church, is fully 29 years of age. So it is disquieting to see such a witty and talented film-maker carefully trotting the callow organised-religion line, so clearly intended to indemnify himself against the charges of uncool moral nihilism and being judgmental about people's beliefs. Should they want to rise, obligingly, to the bait, there's plenty for the faithful to get upset about here. A trendy Catholic cardinal abolishes the dull old crucifix icon and replaces it with something the kids can get down with: the Buddy Christ, in which the Son of God is shown winking, pointing and giving the thumbs-up, like Bill Clinton on some future comeback trail. Angels appear to mortals in the form of anarchic, whimsically destructive individuals of both sexes, hiding their wings in their Gap clothing, and bitterly resenting their lack of genitals: \"If only they'd let us jerk off, ya know?\" says one. The exquisite and ineffably pert Matt Damon is Loki, a renegade angel who has been expelled from the kingdom of heaven and has plans for covert readmittance. He is assisted by fellow renegade angel Bartleby (Ben Affleck, another Smith regular). They are opposed by Metatron (Alan Rickman), the droll angelic voice of God, and the unknown black 13th apostle (Chris Rock) \"marginalised by the white-dominated church\" and they all persuade a lone woman to fight against the interlopers of darkness. God turns out to be a woman played by Alanis Morissette - which is ironic, not to say dire. Our heroine is Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a thirtysomething assistant at an abortion clinic and a postmodern Virgin Mary, who turns out to be descended from one of Jesus's younger siblings that Joseph and Mary had through normal congress and is thus a collateral descendant of God. All this is naturally backed up with regular get-out clauses about the wickedness and fallacy of organised religion, begging the question of just how formless, inchoate, and incommunicably subjective your religion has to be to avoid the stain of organisation. The answer of course is that all faith, and every species of atheism, is \"organised\" in that it is steeped in the structures of language and culture from which it emerges, but this inconvenient reality does not stop Kevin Smith having his cake and eating it with a cheekily iconoclastic movie, periodically reinsured with sorrowing condemnations of church power structure. The film itself is preceded by an elaborately ironic but nervy disclaimer about its being just a joke. Dogma never comes anywhere near the breathtaking audacity of the bright-side-of-life crucifixion scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian. Kevin Smith is not, as Graham Greene might have said, man enough to be damned. And it hardly needs to be said that the same treatment for Islam or Judaism would be unthinkable. In short, Smith's Dogma is exasperatingly smug, transparently sophomoric, and looks uncomfortably like naive adolescent stuff he's been longing to get off his chest for a decade or more. And yet, and yet. It must also be said that Dogma is funky, expertly made, with an engagingly surreal line of fun that runs all the way through and, like all Kevin Smith's movies, has incomparably funny asides about popular culture that make you laugh out loud. Smith reprises his long-running cameo as Silent Bob here along with Jay (Jason Mewes), his friend, who riffs and raps superbly about the iniquities of John Hughes movies. Loki and Bartleby are themselves still arguing about a bet they once had about which movie would turn out to be the bigger hit: ET or Krush Groove (\"The jury's still out on that,\" mutters Loki resentfully). But the biggest joy is Linda Fiorentino, who, perhaps against all the odds, delivers a beautifully modulated, finely judged seriocomic performance as Bethany. It is quite remarkable how this actress, having been typecast in the one-trick-pony role of noir siren, has here flowered here into a mature and sensitive performer. What she needs now is a heavyweight, grown-up film in which to bloom, and Dogma, for all its hit-and-miss offbeat charm, is not exactly that. But I look forward to seeing its reputation flower into a cult classic forever young in midnight screenings on the student circuit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/dec/24/alqaida.world","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-24T02:31:30Z","webTitle":"Parcel bomb alert for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/24/alqaida.world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/dec/24/alqaida.world","fields":{"headline":"Parcel bomb alert for UK","bodyText":"Fears of a coordinated Islamic terrorist offensive deepened yesterday after the American post office warned that it had received \"credible and specific information\" that parcel bombs had been sent to US or British addresses in the run-up to the Christmas and millennium celebrations. Dan Mihalko, a spokesman for the postal inspector's office, said information from an unspecified foreign intelligence service suggested that \"some type of mail [bombs] may be coming from Frankfurt, Germany, into the United States or the United Kingdom.\" While refusing to specify where the threat came from, Scotland Yard last night confirmed that Britain could be a target of Islamic dissidents linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant based in Afghanistan. \"There may be groups or individuals who may try to disrupt the celebrations and people should be on their guard against any suspect packages or anyone acting suspiciously,\" warned Alan Fry, head of the yard's anti-terrorist branch. He added: \"Recent arrests in Jordan and the USA have heightened the public's awareness of a possible threat from Islamic extremist groups.\" The Metropolitan police advised the public to \"dial 999 if they receive an unexpected package, particularly from mainland Europe\", but said it could be not be more specific. A spokesman at Frankfurt airport said security had been stepped up for all cargo flights out of the airport. US postal inspectors at international sorting offices were ordered to x-ray incoming mail, and the American public was advised to look out for parcels from unfamiliar addresses in Germany. An FBI communique, leaked last week, said: \"The CIA speculates that Bin Laden and associates could be planning five to 15 attacks worldwide.\" Thirteen men suspected of planning attacks in Jordan after undergoing explosives training in Afghanistan were arrested in the Middle Eastern kingdom last week. Jordan is also seeking the extradition from Britain of Omar Abu Omar for alleged terrorism. He denies involvement in Bin Laden's al-Qaeda group. Mr Omar, who arrived in 1993 as a political refugee, says he teaches Islamic theology. Adding to the unease in the run-up to the millennium, a Canadian woman who was arrested while trying to enter the US at a remote north-eastern border crossing was alleged yesterday to have links with an Algerian extremist group. Lucia Garofalo was stopped on Sunday in the company of an Algerian, Bouabide Chamchi, who was carrying a forged French passport. The arrests came days after another Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested at a border post near Seattle while trying to enter the US with ingredients for a potentially devastating bomb. At a court hearing in Vermont yesterday, prosecutors said that Ms Garofalo had links with the Algerian Islamic League, an extremist organisation linked to terrorist acts and the illegal arms trade. According to court documents, the league's leader, Mourad Dhina, is a Swiss-based \"arms dealer\" connected with \"organisations sponsoring a number of terrorist acts in Europe and Algeria\". The prosecution quoted US intelligence sources as saying Ms Garofalo's mobile phone and the car she was driving were both registered in the name of Brahim Mahdi, an Algerian Islamic League member. An assistant US attorney, Tristram Coffin, said a number dialled several times from Ms Garofalo's home telephone number had been traced to \"a person under investigation for the theft and sale of dynamite stolen in Ontario.\" The allegations suggest a possible link between Ms Garofalo, Mr Chamchi and Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested on December 14 while trying to cross into the US at a quiet border post near Seattle, carrying nitroglycerine and other bomb-making ingredients in his rented car. Canadian press reports quoted intelligence officials as describing Mr Ressam as a \"professional\" terrorist trained in Afghan camps for Islamic extremists, who had strong links with Osama Bin Laden. In an interview last night, President Bill Clinton advised Americans to stick to their holiday plans, but hospitals in major cities were making contingency plans to cope with a terrorist attack. The state department advised Americans in Pakistan not to travel through the Khyber pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan or take the Khyber steam train to visit the scenic area.

Listening to the choir from St George's Chapel, Windsor, reminds me that this season of carols and Christmas trees is a time to take stock; a time to reflect on the events of the past year and to make resolutions for the new year ahead. This December we are looking back not just on one year, but on a hundred years and a thousand years. History is measured in centuries. More than ever we are aware of being a tiny part of the infinite sweep of time when we move from one century and one millennium to another. And as I look to the future I have no doubt at all that the one certainty is change - and the pace of that change will only seem to increase. This is true for all of us - young and old. On my mother's ninety-ninth birthday last August I was struck by how the inevitability of change affects us all, and how different were my mother's early years compared with those of my grandchildren. For many of their generation the future is a source of excitement, hope and challenge. For others however the future is a cause of understandable anxiety. There are many, for example, of my age or amongst the more vulnerable in society who worry that they will be left behind. The sheer rate of change seems to be sweeping away so much that is familiar and comforting. But I do not think that we should be over-anxious. We can make sense of the future - if we understand the lessons of the past. Winston Churchill, my first Prime Minister, said that \"the further backward you look, the further forward you can see\". It was this importance of history which was much on my mind when I opened the new Scottish Parliament in July this year. Devolution in Scotland and Wales, and more recently the very welcome progress in Northern Ireland, are responses to today's changed circumstances, but they need to be seen in their historical contexts. History and a common past have also played an important part in bringing together so many different nations into the modern Commonwealth. This was a frequent theme last month at the Commonwealth conference in South Africa. At that meeting many of us highlighted the way in which the varied strands of our shared history have been woven together so that we can more effectively address the challenges and opportunities ahead. The Commonwealth, as with the process of devolution in the United Kingdom, reminds us of the importance of bringing the lessons of the past to bear on the aspirations for a better future. To do this we need to draw from our history those constant and unchanging values which have stood the test of time and experience. Fairness and compassion, justice and tolerance; these are the landmarks from the past which can guide us through the years ahead. These timeless values tell us above all about the way we should relate to people rather than to things; thinking of others, not just of ourselves. Earlier this autumn in Manchester I visited some of the Emergency Services, whose responsibilities day in and day out are based on concern for others. As always they are on duty over these Christmas and New Year holidays. Up and down the country people like those firemen, nurses and ambulancemen I met are working tirelessly to help others. They remind us of the responsibility of each and every one of us to show concern for our neighbours and those less fortunate than ourselves. I believe that this provides us with the direction and resolve required for the years ahead. The future is not only about new gadgets, modern technology or the latest fashion, important as these may be. At the centre of all our lives - today and tomorrow - must be the message of caring for others, the message at the heart of Christianity and of all the great religions. This message - love thy neighbour as thyself - may be for Christians two thousand years old. But it is as relevant today as it ever was. I believe it gives us the guidance and the reassurance we need as we step over the threshold into the twenty-first century. And I for one am looking forward to this new Millennium. May I wish you all a merry Christmas and, in this year of all years, a very happy New Year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/dec/26/robertmccrum","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-26T18:56:01Z","webTitle":"Fanfare for the Commonwealth man","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/26/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/dec/26/robertmccrum","fields":{"headline":"Fanfare for the Commonwealth man","bodyText":"In the world of books, the year 1900 seems both near and far. It seems near because some important English and American writers who are still widely read were then in their infancy: T.S. Eliot was only 12, Ernest Hemingway just one, and Noël Coward still a baby. (Evelyn Waugh, John Steinbeck and Graham Greene were not yet born.) And it's far because those quintessential late Victorians Rudyard Kipling and H.G. Wells were, respectively, aged 35 and 34, retired sea-captain Joseph Conrad was only 43, with Heart of Darkness and The Secret Agent still to come; Henry James had yet to write The Wings of a Dove, The Ambassadors and The Golden Bowl. A hundred years ago, poetry characteristically came in couplets, plays were mostly performed in five acts behind a proscenium arch and fiction generally had what Philip Larkin once wittily described as 'a beginning, a muddle, and an end'. In terms of output, too, that fin-de-siècle world was staggeringly different from our own. In 1900, about 12,000 new books were published in the UK; in 1999, the figure was more than 100,000. It was Conrad whose work gives the first clue to the nature of the revolution that was about to engulf the art of fiction and, ultimately, of book publishing as a whole. In Conrad, the use and description of chronological time was the first of the traditional mainstays of conventional fiction to be snapped in the high wind of the great storm that came to be known as modernism. After 1900, time in fiction became relative. The ur-text of this revolution is Nostromo (1904), which experiments almost cinematically with constant shifts of narrative development, extraordinary digressions and multiple viewpoints. It's easy, in hindsight, to associate modernism with Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Similarly, the second important change in fiction attributable to modernism - the interior monologue and 'stream of consciousness' - now seems to belong to Freud, whose Interpretation of Dreams will next year celebrate its first centenary. Standing in the shadow of Freud, the works of Virginia Woolf and D.H. Lawrence have an overt psychological dimension previously unknown in fiction. And in Ulysses (1922), James Joyce completed the novel to which many subsequent British and American novelists seem to be writing a series of footnotes. Virginia Woolf, whose own work was dedicated to the faithful exploration of the minutest shifts of sensation and experience, would have disagreed. She famously remarked that Joyce's masterpiece was no more than 'the scratching of pimples on the body of the bootboy at Claridge's'. After the end of the Great War, the cataclysmic coda to the modernist revolution, nothing would be the same again. When, in his collected lecture series, Aspects of the Novel , E.M. Forster, probably the greatest Edwardian writer, observed in his spinsterish way that 'yes - oh dear yes - the novel tells a story', he was pronouncing an elegy at the graveside of the narrative fiction that had flourished for 100 years and more in libraries and bookshops up and down the kingdom. Appropriately, it's the inter-war years, dominated by that other great modernist text, The Waste Land , to which most of the despised 'genres' (thriller, crime, sci-fi, horror, and children's) that keep publishers in lunches can be traced. And it's now that snobbery about such forms begins to be expressed. Arnold Bennett , one of the most popular novelists of his time, identified this when he complained, in 1928, that 'nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.' That's a sentiment that could have been written yesterday. In other respects, the literature of the Twenties and Thirties is as remote from our own time as it's possible to imagine. There was, for example, then a flourishing avant-garde, something that hardly exists in literature today. It was from this avant-garde that Samuel Beckett, the other central literary figure of the century, was to emerge. Next to Proust, Kafka and Joyce, no other writer has been so influential or so attuned to the Zeitgeist. Waiting for Godot is among the unchallenged masterpieces of the postwar era, and Beckett's five great novels - Murphy, Watt, Molloy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable - define an oeuvre of universal importance and astonishing influence. There was, however, in the Anglocentric world of books, one final, rather less austere, revolution to come - the decolonisation (or perhaps 'globalisation') of the English language. Before the Twenties and Thirties, and as late as the Fifties and Sixties, the English-speaking world focused its attention largely on London. In literary terms, London saw itself as the Vatican City of English-language culture. This attitude was, in turn, the residue of a colonising impulse expressed by Charles Kingsley in Westward Ho!, when he wrote of 'brave young England longing to wing its way out of its island prison, to discover and to traffic, to colonise and to civilise, until no wind can sweep the Earth which does not bear the echoes of an English voice'. By the Thirties and Forties, those echoes had developed into such distinctive and vigorous varieties of English - from India and South Africa to Australia and New Zealand - that local 'Commonwealth' literatures were beginning to express their creative identities in London, the old 'centre' of English literary culture. The emblem of this vital cultural transition is probably V.S. Naipaul, for many today the greatest living writer of English. It was in the Fifties and Sixties that Naipaul's fiction (notably The Mystic Masseur and A House For Mr Biswas ) began to catch the eye of discerning literary critics. At almost the same time, the Australian novelist Patrick White was giving to the 'English' novel a fresh perspective and a wholly new set of accents. Today, Naipaul and White can be seen as the crucial precursors of an astounding generation, led by Salman Rushdie and his seminal Midnight's Children which, during the Eighties, redefined the English novel: globalised it, recharged it with the voltage of innovation and found a colossal new audience for contemporary fiction, now known, weirdly, as 'literary fiction'. In fact, from some points of view, it is possible to write a plausible narrative of 'contemporary English literature' around the names of Rushdie, Ben Okri, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo, Vikram Seth, Rohinton Mistry and Michael Ondaatje (to name some of the most obvious). The many judges of the Booker Prize obviously think so. From 1980 to 1999, the majority of Booker prizewinners have come from the post-colonial periphery rather than the post-imperial centre. This was, as Rushdie himself put it, a case of 'the Empire strikes back'. Many of these and other contemporary writers would agree that they were postmodernists, just as the publishers who cashed in on their efforts can be seen as postmodernist businessmen and women. As the century turns, the first stirrings of a return to storytelling and narrative are discernible. The popularity of such non-fiction bestsellers as Longitude, Angela's Ashes and Stalingrad suggests that the abandoned Victorian literary values of 1900 have not become completely out of date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/dec/28/warcrimes.germany","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-28T11:47:49Z","webTitle":"'Nazi killer' hiding in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/28/warcrimes.germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/28/warcrimes.germany","fields":{"headline":"'Nazi killer' hiding in Britain","bodyText":"Nazi hunters last night demanded that British police investigate a suspected war criminal who has entered the country and is alleged to have been involved in the murder of 30,000 people during the second world war. Konrad Kalejs is believed to have come to Britain this summer and to be living in Rugby, having been deported by the US and forced to leave Canada because of his alleged involvement in war crimes. A US court branded him a \"key officer\" in the murder of thousands of Jews in the Baltic state of Latvia. Evidence seen by the Guardian gathered by the US justice department implicates Kalejs in atrocities while a member of a Latvian death squad that collaborated with the Nazis after they invaded the country. Yesterday Warwickshire police were considering a demand from the Simon Wiesenthal centre, which tracks Nazi war criminals and collaborators, to prosecute the 86-year-old Kalejs or deport him. Any charges would re-ignite the debate over whether ageing war criminals should be prosecuted for crimes committed more than 50 years ago. Immigration officials in Britain were set to investigate whether Kalejs, an Australian citizen, entered the country illegally. Kalejs was joint second in command in the Latvian security auxiliary police, known as the Arajs Kommando. It was headed by Victor Arajs who was sentenced to life for war crimes after being tried in Germany. Kalejs served at the Salaspils concentration camp outside Riga, where Jews and political prisoners were executed or died due to appalling conditions. After the war Kalejs gained Australian citizenship before moving to the US in 1959. There he made a fortune but in 1984 the US started deportation proceedings. After a lengthy battle he was expelled when documented evidence emerged of his wartime past. On entry to the US he had claimed to have been a farm labourer during the war. After being deported Kalejs returned to Australia and in 1997 he was discovered in Canada, which deported him. Eli Rosenbaum who led the US justice department investigation into Kalejs, told the Guardian: \"The evidence we presented in court was documentary evidence that he was in the Arajs Kommando, a mobile killing unit, and we presented testimonies of people who served with him who implicate him in atrocities. \"When he is in Australia he is the focus of constant media attention. I assume the purpose of him going to the UK was to hide out in your country.\" Dr Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal centre in Jerusalem claimed Kalejs was one of the worst war criminals still at large. In his letter to police he wrote: \"We believe that Kalejs does not deserve the privilege of residing in the United Kingdom given his active service as an officer in a unit which murdered tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children.\" In evidence gathered by the US justice department Kalejs is implicated in massacres by victims and his fellow soldiers. Private Rudolf Soms testified that in 1942 Kalejs led a company that \"exterminated\" gypsies in a village near Zabolyte, on Latvia's eastern front, before razing it to the ground. A month later another village, Sanniki, was burnt to the ground and inhabitants in its central section killed. Karlis Strazds, a guard at the Salaspils camp, testified that Kalejs was the company commander of the guard unit at the death camp totalling 100-120 men. He was ordered to shoot escapees and that inmates, mainly Jewish, were beaten. At another camp he saw 20-30 gypsies shot and buried in a mass grave. Labour MP Robin Corbett, chairman of the house of commons home affairs select committee, said: \"If there is enough evidence he should be prosecuted. Time does not wipe out a crime of this alleged magnitude. \"I think the Latvian government should be told about him and invited to seek his extradition. It would be preferable for him to stand trial in Latvia, presumably that's where the witnesses would be.\" Lord Janner, chairman of the Holocaust educational trust, called for an inquiry into how Kalejs gained entry in the United Kingdom. Last night at Kalejs's last known address in the UK, callers were told that they had the wrong number. Australia declined to prosecute Kalejs because of insufficient evidence, and the US constitution prohibits the trying of people suspected of crimes not committed on American soil. British law allows people suspected of war crimes abroad to be tried here. But a special war crimes unit set up by Scotland Yard managed to secure only one conviction, against Anthony Sawoniuk, 78, jailed for life earlier this year after an Old Bailey trial. The unit was wound up this year, but a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/dec/29/labour.labour1997to99","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-29T14:12:22Z","webTitle":"Blair's millennium message","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/29/labour.labour1997to99","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/dec/29/labour.labour1997to99","fields":{"headline":"Blair's millennium message","bodyText":"Tony Blair has delivered his New Year message to the country, saying although his Government had achieved many goals there was still much to do in the new millennium. Speaking at Trimdon Colliery Community Centre in his County Durham constituency, the Prime Minister outlined many areas of growth, citing the country's strong economy and rising employment levels. He called on Britain to beware of a lack of self-belief and the fear of change in the next century. He said: \"In two-and-a-half-years of office we have laid the foundations of a new and better Britain. In time, given the chance I believe we will transform Britain. \"But I acknowledge immediately that though there is much done, there is much more to do. \"Today the economy is back on track. For the first time in decades, the economy has slowed down and then recovered without recession. Inflation and interest rates are lower, public finances are in excellent shape and the national debt is declining. \"More than that, employment has continued to grow, unemployment to fall. Since May 1997, long term unemployment has more than halved.\" Mr Blair went on to emphasise the importance of education to the strength of Britain's economy. He added: \"The long term strength of our economy also depends on the strength of our schools. If we are to succeed then we need to make a big leap forward in educational achievement. \"But we have a lot more still to do. In the next year we have to see through our radical reform of the teaching profession - paying good teachers more and raising the esteem and status of the profession. On tackling problems with NHS services and the transport infrastructure of the country, Mr Blair stressed that the job he set out to do was not yet complete. He said: \"Yes, in-patient waiting lists are now falling for the first time in years. But we need to turn the tide on out-patients too. \"People want to see the new doctors and nurses on the wards, want the new system to tackle cancer and heart disease, up and running. \"So the foundations may be laid, but there is much more to do. \"On transport I know the nature of the challenge we face. Years of under-investment. The fragmentation of our railways through a botched privatisation. And of course massive rise in demand. \"But the process leading up to next July should see in place a framework which will increase radically the amounts of investment in our transport infrastructure, use it better and plan it on an integrated basis.\" Looking back on his Government's performance, Mr Blair added: \"What is the single biggest lesson we can learn as a Government and a party from our first two-and-a-half years of government? That the key to all change and progress is reform; to be radical. \"Our achievements have not been accidental. They have not come about by luck or chance. They derive directly from reforms we have made, changes which in turn derive directly from the values and ideas of New Labour.\" Reflecting on the struggle that he had to change his party, the Prime Minister continued: \"Every one of them was controversial. Every one resisted. Some unpopular even in the Labour party. \"One nation politics, enterprise and fairness combined with the courage and will to change: this is what has produced results for Britain. \"We were radical reformers when we introduced Bank of England independence and the new rules on public finances. The reform led to the achievement of a stable economy. \"We were radical reformers when we brought in the New Deal, the reform led to the achievement of falling unemployment. \"When we finally answered the calls for a new dispensation for the nations of the United Kingdom and ushered in a new partnership between us through devolution, we were radical reformers. \"But when we said farewell to hundreds of hereditary peers and began to modernise the House of Lords, we were radical reformers.\" Looking to the future, the Prime Minister said: \"The 20th century was a century in which for all our extraordinary achievements - most notably in World War Two - Britain's power declined. \"But it can be rebuilt in a new way for a different age. Some of the changes in the 80s were necessary to do this in removing obstacles to enterprise. \"The 80s called for a different type of Conservative Party; this time calls for a different type of Labour Party. \"I want a Britain that is defined to the world as a beacon of tolerance, liberty and enterprise. \"Britain will not be the mightiest nation of the 21st century in size or population; but it can be the best, it can be that beacon to the world.\" The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the country can meet the challenges facing it in the next century. He said: \"I am clear about the challenges and confident we can meet them. \"Some people might have predicted that with the loss of our empire, Britain would slowly fade away - swamped by the giants of America, Russia or China. \"But as we enter the next century I believe the reverse is true. We have every reason to be confident - confident of our place in the world, confident of the talents of the British people, confident that we can be a model 21st century nation. \"I want the next century to be one where Britain's worth is measured not in how much of the globe it owns or conquers, but measured by the achievements of its citizens, by the sort of people we want to become, the sort of society we choose to create. \"The real threat to Britain succeeding in the next century, would be a lack of self belief, a failure to embrace change, to shape it for our own ends. \"That is why I constantly urge us as a country to take those values that have made us great in the past and put them to work making Britain succeed in the future - the challenges are clear - and I believe we have the character and the confidence to meet them.\" In response to the speech, Tory shadow cabinet member John Maples accused Mr Blair of failing to make 1999 the year when Labour delivered on its election promises. He said: \"Last January, we were told 1999 was going to be the year of delivery. This was just the great Labour lie. \"In his millennium message, Mr Blair said education was a priority. However, average class sizes are now higher than in 1997. \"He talked about health, but waiting lists have risen. \"Mr Blair talks of wanting to be a beacon to the world, yet when we were threatened with the art sales tax, withholding tax and the beef ban, Mr Blair failed to protect Britain's interests. \"Yet he has made concession after concession to our European partners. \"1999 has been a bad year for motorists, savers, the art market, pupils, patients and victims of crime, and despite Mr Blair's warm words, the year 2000 doesn't look any better.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/29/davidmckie","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-29T16:43:22Z","webTitle":"Why put our faith in polls?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/29/davidmckie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/29/davidmckie","fields":{"headline":"Why put our faith in polls?","bodyText":"The merciless flood of end-of-millennium surveys on what we all think about everything under the sun shows little sign of abating. The latest has to do with religious belief. A curious assortment of people - church leaders, politicians, scientists, head teachers and newspaper editors - were asked a succession of questions from: \"Do you believe God created the world in six days?\" to \"Are the ten commandments applicable today?\" The really intriguing feature of these proceedings, as reported by the BBC Today programme which commissioned the exercise, was that a substantial number of Church of England bishops, Roman Catholic bishops and Methodist ministers could not accept the Genesis view of the creation, while one in four clerics did not believe that Christ's was a virgin birth. There was also significant doubt about Christ's resurrection. None of this would have surprised those who follow these matters closely. It is generally understood by such people that the revisionist views which not so long ago landed the Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, in such hot water are more widely shared at high levels than the average churchgoer appreciates. To many regulars in the pews, however, these results will be grievously troubling, and they will probably share the anger of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, who condemned the exercise as \"trivialisation\". It must surely, in any case, be self-evident that religious truth is an area, more than most, where the majority may be hopelessly wrong and the minority entirely right. Fifty-eight per cent of those questioned said they did not believe there was such a state as purgatory. If there is such a place as purgatory, though, they may find themselves there one day soon. It is probably just as well that polls had not been invented in the lifetime of Christ. One can imagine that on the question, for instance, of the feeding of the 5,000, huge majorities would have approved, with only a few respondents - mostly bakers and fishermen, worrying over the implications for their businesses - registering dissatisfaction. The overturning of the moneylenders' tables in the Temple might have polarised opinion, with the 18-34 age group largely in favour, but over-65s thinking it somewhat over the top. The warning that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a rich man to pass though the eye of a needle would have won the general consent of class D and E social groups, but played rather less well with the top earning As and Bs. There are of course examples in the gospels of public opinion being sampled, like Pilate's demand that people should choose who deserved to be saved, which produced the reply: not this man, but Barrabas. Those who answered, of course, were not what social scientists term a statistically significant sample. They were largely those who had come to shout. In this sense Pilate's exercise closely resembled the sort of thing they often do in the Sun, where readers are asked to phone in saying yes or no to some proposition like \"Would you like to see paedophiles burned at the stake?\" Those who provide the results are not in any sense a cross-section of public opinion. They are drawn from an unrepresentative minority - people who read the Sun. And they speak in effect only for a minority of that minority - ie those readers of the Sun who have the time and the inclination to take part in ludicrous surveys. That what emerges is then reported as the fruits of a \"poll\" simply shows how little the science of polling is understood. To call the results obtained by the BBC in its survey of religious opinion a \"poll\" would be hardly more realistic than that. Anti-hunting protests As they thundered over the fields in the seasonal pursuit of their prey, fox hunters were apparently buoyed by yet another projected wheeze for saving their \"sport\" from extinction. Lord Daresbury, chairman of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association and master of the Wynstay hunt in Cheshire and North Wales, has written to 200 hunts suggesting a change in the traditional hunting uniform of red coats. The public thinks it's elitist, he says. It antagonises them. They might be won round if huntspeople wore warm tweed jackets instead. What masters of foxhounds and those who follow behind them seem quite unable to grasp is that those who want hunting banned do so not because they think it's the sport of toffs, but because they believe, and with very good reason, that it's indefensibly cruel. They do not accept that the only way to keep down the fox population is to have the fox chased to its death and then mauled by hounds. That has nothing to do with what people devoted to blood sports wear. The objections would be just the same if they sallied out in pashminas, or dinner jackets with cummerbunds, or fur-trimmed lilac bikinis and bright purple balaclavas. All of which they would probably try if they thought it would save them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/30/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-30T00:31:37Z","webTitle":"Irving Rapper","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/30/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/30/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"Irving Rapper","bodyText":"Bette Davis, struggling not to weep, saucer eyes gleaming, stares across at handsome continental Paul Henreid. He has just lit two cigarettes and handed her one. They are framed in profile by an open window. He cannot divorce his wife, and their romance has to end. \"And will you be happy, Charlotte?\" he asks. \"Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon, we have the stars.\" As Max Steiner's seductive theme music rises, so does Sol Polito's camera - up to the clear night sky, replete with impossibly twinkling stars. It is the celebrated end of Now, Voyager, one of the best and most cherished of all \"women's weepies\" of the 1940s. It was directed by Irving Rapper, who has died aged 101. One critic referred to this classy melodrama as \"piffle directed by Rapper with mesmerising skill\". In a way, most of Rapper's assignments at Warner Bros, where he was under contract for nine years, could be described as such. Irving Rapper was born in London and, although his parents emigrated to the US when he was eight years old, his accent always bore traces of his birthplace. While studying law and journalism at New York University, he joined the Washington Square Players as an actor and director, before getting to Broadway. Rapper's big break came in 1930 when Raymond Massey asked him to direct the London company of Five Star Final, Louis Weitzenkorn's hard-hitting play on tabloid journalism. In London he met the theatre producer Gilbert Miller and returned to the US with him to assist on a production of Philip Barry's The Animal Kingdom, from which the novice actress Katharine Hepburn was fired after the Pittsburgh tryout. With the advent of sound movies, many \"silent\" but gifted directors had need of stage directors to help perfect dialogue, and the 27-year-old Rapper was brought to Hollywood as a dialogue coach. He was especially lucky to be needed at Warner Bros by the Hungarian Michael Curtiz, the German William Dieterle and the Russian Anatole Litvak, \"all of whom,\" according to Rapper, \"assassinated the English language\". His first two assignments as director at Warners in 1941 were worthy sentimental dramas: Shining Victory, adapted from an AJ Cronin play about a psychiatrist (James Stephenson) in a Scottish sanatorium, and One Foot in Heaven, based on the life of a peripatetic Methodist minister (Fredric March) at the turn of the century; both films revealed his talents as a skilled Hollywood craftsman. The following year came The Gay Sisters, being the Gaylord sisters, three heiresses struggling to keep their Fifth Avenue mansion out of the hands of property developers. The oldest was played with relish by Barbara Stanwyck, whom Rapper thought \"the easiest lady to work with, so simple, so unassuming, so disciplined\". Unlike Bette Davis, whom he considered \"both the best actress and the most impossible woman\", and with whom he would make four pictures, the first being Now, Voyager (1942). At the 1977 American Film Institute tribute to Davis, Paul Henreid claimed that he had invented the piece of business with the cigarettes and that the director, \"who shall be nameless\", objected to it. \"He denigrated me, and Bette applauded him!\" Rapper fumed. \"I didn't want Henreid in Deception. I wanted Charles Boyer, but Bette begged me not to break up the team.\" In Deception (1946), which one critic described as \"like grand opera, only the people are thinner\", Claude Rains played a composer (for whom Erich Korngold provided a flamboyant score), who does everything he can to break up the relationship between the woman he loves (Davis) and a cellist (Henreid). Prior to this richly enjoyable tosh, Rapper had directed, in a restrained manner, a heavily-padded Davis as a schoolteacher in Emlyn Williams's The Corn is Green (1945), though its atmosphere smacked more of the Hollywood Hills than the Welsh valleys. He also delivered two biopics, the sober 130-minute The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944), with Fredric March in the title role, and the highly fictionalised Rhapsody in Blue (1945), starring Robert Alda (father of Alan) as George Gershwin. \"I made the biggest mistake of my life in casting Robert Alda!\" Rapper remarked. \"I had to teach him every line, and he'd raise and lower his eyebrows constantly. I wanted Tyrone Power, but he was in the army.\" Neither did Rapper think much of Ronald Reagan, whom he directed as a soldier on leave in the likeable romantic comedy The Voice of the Turtle (1947). \"Reagan came to my office, straddled a chair - like a horse - and said, 'The story stinks! I don't like it. I'm doing it as a favour to Jack Warner.' We went through the motions of filming. He didn't like wearing a private soldier's uniform. I didn't know he had his eye on being Commander-in-Chief.\" Rapper handled, with sensitivity, the screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams's first successful play, The Glass Menagerie (1950), carefully avoiding any stagey look to it. However, he rightly felt that Gertrude Lawrence was miscast as Amanda Wingfield. He wanted Tallulah Bankhead, who tested for the part, but the studio considered her a risk because of her drinking problem. Having left Warner Bros to become a freelance, Rapper directed Another Man's Poison (1952), a preposterous melodrama, filmed in England, in which Bette Davis is a novelist who poisons both her husband and lover; and Forever Female (1954), a witty comedy on the theatre, based on JM Barrie, starring Ginger Rogers, delightful as an ageing stage actress trying to play it young, and William Holden as an egotistical playwright. Inexplicably, Rapper's favourite film was The Brave One (1956), shot in Mexico, about a boy who loves his pet bull so much that he goes to see the president of Mexico to ask him to reprieve the animal before it is thrown into the bullring. Kindness to animals is often cruelty to audiences, but it was well photographed in colour and CinemaScope by Jack Cardiff. After eight years away, Rapper returned to a changed Warner Bros to direct Marjorie Morningstar (1958), which diluted the Herman Wouk novel's Jewishness and had an inadequate but lovely Natalie Wood in the title role; and The Miracle (1959), a disaster concerning the amorous adventures of a postulant nun (Carroll Baker, who never saw eye to eye with Rapper). Like many directors at the breakup of the studio system, Irving Rapper subsequently drifted in the wilderness, only making four films in the next 20 years. They were a couple of stodgy made-in-Italy bible stories, The Story of Joseph and his Brethren (1960) and Pontius Pilate (1962), in which John Drew Barrymore played both Christ and Judas; and a couple of bizarre biopics: The Christine Jorgensen Story (1970) a risible retelling of the true story of the first sex change operation, during which George became Christine, and Born Again (1978), about Nixon aide Charles Colson's religious conversion after Watergate.

It is an odd ritual, in that the letter is never sent or, at least, if it is, I have no idea to whom I send it or whether they read it. But with not only the new year, but also a new millennium just days away, I decided this year to deliver my new year message as a speech and I'm delighted to be doing it here in Trimdon. In two and a half years of office we are laying the foundations of a new and better Britain. In time, given the chance, I believe we will transform Britain. But I acknowledge immediately that though there is much done, there is much more to do. There are 700,000 more jobs in Britain in December 1999 than in May 1997. And there are nearly 150,000 young people now in work in unsubsidised jobs through the New Deal, over 350,000 benefiting from it in total. Since May 1997, long-term unemployment has more than halved. As a result, welfare spending, when we strip out those areas like child benefit where spending increases are deliberate, is now falling, again for the first time in many years. The New Deal is only the first step in a new approach to welfare and work. On its foundation, we must build a new welfare system, with an employment and benefits service geared to work for those who can work, and security for those who can't. Education We said education would be our number one priority and it has been. Take examination results for 11-year-olds as the best example - up 10% for mathematics and 5% for reading as a result of our intensive action through the national numeracy and literacy hours. At the same time schools are getting more money for books and computers. Five thousand run down school buildings have already been repaired, another 6,000 have had money allocated for new repairs. Class sizes are coming down in primary schools, as promised. Specialist and beacon schools are now being extended, schools which represent a fundamental modernisation of the comprehensive principle, by catering for the different needs and abilities of pupils. Their results show a significant improvement. But we have a lot more still to do. In the next year we have to see through our radical reform of the teaching profession - paying good teachers more and raising the esteem and status of the profession. We have to continue the overhaul of inner city comprehensives, tackling failing schools and LEAs. We have to raise standards further. We have to tackle the appalling legacy of adult illiteracy or lack of skills. Education remains number one priority. NHS I understand the frustration at the pace of change in the NHS. I share it. By its very nature, change in the NHS is slower, but it is happening here too. The two-tier NHS, with the divisive internal market, has gone. The primary care groups and trusts will be powerful drivers of change, keeping local doctors in the driving seat but in a way that serves all the patients not simply, as in the old system, those of GP fundholders. The new national institute for clinical excellence and commission for health improvement will provide, for the first time, an objective assessment of health care standards and the means of raising them. NHS Direct is gearing up an entirely new ability on the part of patients to access health care conveniently and quickly. So will the refurbishment by the end of next year of all A&amp;E departments that need it; so will the 37 new hospitals, of which 19 are already under construction, some here in the north-east; so will the thousands of new doctors and nurses now under training. Funding is increasing, but we have to make up a lot of ground. By the end of the parliament, for the first time, the proportion of national income spent on the NHS will rise to 6%. But that still lags behind many similar nations abroad which is why I am determined for there to be sustained increases in investment in the health service. And people want results. Yes, in-patient waiting lists are now falling for the first time in years. But we need to turn the tide on out-patients too. People want to see the new doctors and nurses on the wards, want the new system to tackle cancer and heart disease up and running. So the foundations may be laid, but there is much more to do. On crime we are putting in place measures that are both tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. Tough on crime - like in future an automatic prison sentence for those convicted for the third time for burglary, and the power for police to test for drugs anyone arrested on suspicion of a criminal offence. Tough on the causes of crime with the biggest ever investment in crime reduction including £150 million for CCTV and an anti-burglary measure covering the 2m homes in crime spots throughout the country. Transport On transport, I know the nature of the challenge we face. Years of under-investment. The fragmentation of our railways through a botched privatisation. And, of course, massive rising demand: passenger numbers up 15% in the last two years; road usage up 10%; Tube travel up 12%. But the process leading up to next July should see in place, at long last, a framework which will increase radically the amount of investment in our transport infrastructure, use it better and plan it on an integrated basis. Sometimes that will mean travel by car, particularly in rural areas. Sometimes it will mean public transport, sometimes a combination of both. Through public/private partnerships and the treasury's guarantee of putting any extra money from fuel duties back into transport, we will lever in the biggest ever new investment. Already we have sorted out the chaos in the road building programme we inherited. We have increased roads maintenance by 30%. There are 1,800 more bus services than two years ago and over 1,000 more train services a day. In all these areas we have done a lot in two and a half short years but there is still much more to be done. What is the single biggest lesson we can learn, as a government and a party, from our first two and a half years of government? That the key to all change and progress is reform; to be radical. Our achievements have not been accidental. They have not come about by luck or chance. They derive directly from reforms we have made, changes which in turn derive directly from the values and ideas of New Labour. Every one of them was controversial. Every one resisted. Some unpopular, even in the Labour party. Devolution When we finally answered the calls for a new dispensation for the nations of the United Kingdom and ushered in a new partnership between us through devolution, we were radical reformers. And for all the difficulties in doing it, we have a fairer and more balanced relationship today than the status quo ever represented. For all the difficulties we have faced in trying to build a new peace in Northern Ireland, we have persevered. Not just us, but the Irish government and the parties in Northern Ireland have had to be radical reformers and as a result families have for the first time in years been able at Christmas to feel the real hope of a better future for their children. Our goal is to create a nation where fairness and enterprise go together, where the 20th century choice posed for politics between economic competence and social justice, is consigned to the history of this century and set aside for the next. I want a Britain that is defined to the world as a beacon of tolerance, liberty and enterprise. For all the cynics and the critics who, because all the country's ills have not been put right overnight, insist nothing has changed; I defy anyone to deny that on social exclusion, poverty, third world development, there is now a different government in Britain today, governing with a different set of values to our Conservative predecessor. Britain will not be the mightiest nation of the 21st century in size or population; but it can be the best, it can be that beacon to the world. In my view, successful nations in the new millennium will have at least some of these five characteristics. First, they will be highly flexible and adaptable, able to meet the challenge of the pace of change. Second, the successful nations will see education as the key economic and social imperative for us all. Third, a successful nation will develop new bonds of connection, of community. Even though today's world is individualised, the age of mass production over; diversity in lifestyle so much more prevalent; people need communities. Fourth, nations will be driven to cooperate more across national boundaries. In a nuclear age, with more countries achieving nuclear capability, we will need better systems of international security, better channels of dialogue for peace. Finally, nations that succeed will be tolerant, respectful of diversity, multi-racial, multi-cultural societies. Faith is important for people and will remain so. But faith is at its best when allied to reason and tolerance. Some people might have predicted that, with the loss of our empire, Britain would slowly fade away - swamped by the giants of America, Russia or China. But, as we enter the next century, I believe the reverse is true. We have every reason to be confident - confident of our place in the world, confident of the talents of the British people, confident that we can be a model 21st century nation. We will always stand out as a nation, we will never be a run-of-the-mill people doing run-of-the-mill things - there's simply too much talent for that to happen. It is why Britain will be putting on the best millennium celebrations anywhere in the world. That is why I constantly urge us as a country to take those values that have made us great in the past and put them to work making Britain succeed in the future. The challenges are clear. I believe we have the character and the confidence to meet them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/dec/31/food.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-31T01:17:28Z","webTitle":"EU court action to overturn French beef ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/31/food.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/dec/31/food.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"EU court action to overturn French beef ban","bodyText":"The European commission will next week begin legal action against France for its refusal to lift its ban on British beef, four months after exports were meant to resume. Papers will lodged with the European court of justice in Luxembourg after the new year holiday following the failure of diplomacy to resolve the dispute. But the French government raised the stakes in the trade war by threatening to bring its own court case against the commission for allegedly failing to do enough to protect consumer health. It continued to argue there was a significant risk to public health from British meat that might be infected with BSE. The British government said that it was \"a shame\" legal action against France was necessary and that Paris would not abide by its EU treaty obligations. The next stage was announced in Brussels after France had sent a letter making a fresh attempt to justify the blockade, hours before the expiry of a deadline for a response to the threat of legal action. \"We consider there is nothing spectacularly new in the arguments put forward by France,\" a commission spokesman said. \"Therefore we have decided to go to court.\" It will be months before the case gets to the courtroom, possibly coinciding with France's six-month presidency of the EU which begins on July 1 next year. The dispute might involve years of legal action. France is bound by a vote of EU governments, in which France abstained, to resume taking British beef from August 1. Paris refused to honour the agreement after the new French food safety agency challenged scientific evidence of British beef, and has refused to change its mind - although the EU's scientific committee has said the beef is as safe as any in Europe. Formal infringement proceedings against France were started on November 16 but there have been two delays in the action. Yesterday's letter from the office of the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said that \"serious doubts\" persisted about risks to human health presented by eating British beef under the export scheme. \"In the absence of more data on the evolution of the epidemic in the United Kingdom, it is not possible at the moment for French authorities to authorise the introduction for human consumption on their territory of meat covered by the scheme. \"In deciding not to revise its initial decision despite the new elements brought to its attention, the commission has disregarded the principle of precaution enshrined in the [EU] treaty.\" In London the ministry of agriculture said: \"The French government still has it within its hands to lift this legal action. \"All it has to do is comply with European law.\" The EU food safety commissioner, David Byrne, must also decide soon whether to launch similar action against Ger many, the other EU country not taking British beef. The German government has said only bureaucratic hold-ups that are delaying reversing its ban, but concerns about health risks have been expressed by some German regional authorities which have the power of decide whether to accept imports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/1999/dec/31/cricket3","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-31T17:53:25Z","webTitle":"Delivery of the century","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/1999/dec/31/cricket3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/1999/dec/31/cricket3","fields":{"headline":"Delivery of the century","bodyText":"Delivery of the Century Whistling through his beard Test match cricket's very Delivery of the Century might actually have been only the second one delivered in the very first Test of the brand-new twentieth century - on the first day of the first Test of the Ashes series on 1 January at Melbourne in 1902: Trumper b Barnes 2 Then again, it could have been at Adelaide twenty-three Januaries later when another first-morning, first-over delivery - this time a legcutter, fashioned far away in Sussex - snortingly pinged out the Aussie captain's middle peg: Collins b Tate 3 Who is to say the best of them all wasn't delivered just a year later in south London, in August 1926 at The Oval, when England blooded the square-shouldered young miner Harold Larwood? The twenty-one-year-old Nottinghamshire prospect led the attack with the recalled and supreme old forty-niner, Wilfred Rhodes. This time, doughty Bill Ponsford was on strike, and almost three score and ten years later Larwood, aged and stooped and blind, was to sit me down and recall that delivery as vividly as if it had been only the week before: 'Rhodes was pure genius. I got Woodfull for a duck and after a bit Rhodes came on. That Ponsford was a vicious cutter of the ball, vicious. I was at point but Rhodes keeps signalling me closer to the bat. Still fetching me up till I'm almost standing on Ponsford's crease. Sure I'm a bit scared. Rhodes comes up, just two paces from behind the umpire. But he stops dead, and stares at me. 'I'd involuntarily taken a pace back from Ponsford's crease. He fetches me in again. First ball nips through and smacks into Struddy's gloves. Second ball breaks back - and Ponsford, surprised, pops it up and I jump across and catch it left-handed. Rhodes walks down the pitch to me and says softly, \"You can go back a bit now, sonny, we got him.\"' Ponsford c Larwood b Rhodes 12 Or again, three full-bloom summers after that, and with Surrey's same gasometers standing sentry, might the Ball of the Century have been the skidder with which dark-haired Alan Fairfax did for the greybeard and Master, Jack Hobbs, in his very own kingdom and in his very last Test innings: Hobbs b Fairfax 9 Nine! What sort of score was that for a forever curtain-call? Hobbs's biographer, the always evocative Ronald Mason, described it poignantly: 'You could hear the cavernous gasp as the bails fell ... as for just that second longer than usual Hobbs stood motionless, looking at the broken wicket. If it had been 0 now, as Bradman's last innings was, there had been some perverse distinction in the failure; but 9 was neither here nor there. The foundations were kicked away from the excitement, the evening dusk gathered above the players ... and the crowd sloped home in sadness, feeling for their hero.' To be sure, for such evocation's sake, that medium-fast delivery from Fairfax, which pitched middle-and-leg and took Hobbs's middle, will remain logged and indelible for more than this century, not for more than a passing moment for the bowler who bowled it, but for the giant of an old batsman it dismissed. Context is crucially important here, as everywhere in history. How about this scorecard line, for instance, at the very top of the innocent innings in Australia's first Test at Sydney against Jardine's Englishmen of what was, within weeks, to be known as the Bodyline tour? It was December 1932 and if this was not prophecy, what was? Woodfull b Larwood 0 So was this, by Jove, in the second Test of that notorious series, moments after the mighty young Bradman, having missed the first Test, took guard at Melbourne: Bradman b Bowes 0 That was, in fact, an aberration by both Bradman and Bowes. Bradman did not often miss long-hops. But did the ball from the resplendently hostile Larwood during the next Test at Adelaide in January signpost the way bowling would develop through the next two-thirds of the century? Oldfield retired hurt 41 Certainly, those deliveries by Larwood and Bowes reverberated around cricket's British empire. So, mercifully, and in solely sporting terms, did this nippy, left-arm back-of-the-hander which cut off Walter Hammond, again at ever lovely Adelaide, in February four years later. It had the onliest Neville Cardus cabling back to the Manchester Guardian, 'If one single ball ever won a Test match, this was it. Hammond b Fleetwood-Smith 39 ... and continuing, 'In the morning's first over, Fleetwood-Smith practically settled the issue. A lovely ball lured Hammond forward, broke at the critical length, evaded the bat, and bowled England's pivot and main hope. The crowd roared out their joy, and sent three cheers into the sunshine for Fleetwood-Smith, while skipper Bradman ran to him and shook his hand.' Same Australian captain, same month, same place, ten years later, and another famed English journalist, EW Swanton, was due to dine that balmy Adelaide evening of 1946 chez Bradman and was escaping the rush by leaving the ground an over or so before the close with Jessie Bradman and her son John: 'Suddenly a tremendous uproar. \"That'll be Dad,\" said John.' It was: Bradman b Bedser 0 ... and the one delivery to which the most prolifically breathtaking batsman the game had known later gave, and always has, the ultimate palm of palms. Says Bradman: 'The ball with which Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps.' In their totally different ways, the Australians Lindwall and Miller, each utterly hostile, were, as the century thought of coming out for its second-half, followed by the West Indian wiles and often unreadable guiles of Ramadhin and Valentine. The four of them bowled many a ripe peach, jaffa and plum in their celebrated careers in tandem. This solitary Wisden small-print line, in the very first Ashes Test after the war at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1946, was to serve salutary and immediate notice of what lay in store for world and English cricket for more than the next decade: Hutton b Miller 7 So did this top-of-the-card double-legend announcement at Lord's on 26 June 1950 - the very beginning of the first Test match the West Indies were ever to win in England - when the captain Goddard made a double bowling-change after his ineffective new-ball seamers, King and Worrell, had bowled the opening twenty-odd trundling overs and everybody was yawning and looking to lunch and the Thermos flask. Within minutes, it was: Hutton st Walcott b Valentine 35 Washbrook st Walcott b Ramadhin 36 ... and international cricket was, quite deliciously, never the same again. And after which the Test batsmen of the world were, more often than not, equally stumped - 'ramanvalled' was the collectively ambushed word - for answers for more than half-a-dozen years. And if they hadn't got you, some time that year, or next, then the demon-fast Lindwall would. Few weren't 'lindwalled' either and, to be sure, the Australian's spearing yorker was a thing of lethal beauty - ask Graveney after Lord's in 1953, or Hutton after Headingley in 1956. Two deliveries of the century? Quite possibly. Well, Hutton said it was the finest yorker that had ever bowled him, and Lindwall himself told me before he died in 1996 that, yes, the inswinging blockhole job which had done for Graveney 43 years earlier, was his best of all: 'Tom jammed a lot of bat on it, but it still got through.' Only students of some of the outstanding Indian mystics of the Century's second-half might oppose the motion that Jim Laker was the best off-spinner of the whole 100 years. Every delivery from his raw index-finger, twisted off that high-stepped pirouette, whizzed with menace. Long after his summer mirabilis in 1956, and till his death, Jim would hold your gaze, knowing all, and grin that Yorkie's clenched, but always amiably confiding, clothes-peg grin and tell you (seeing you pushed him) about Old Trafford in July 1956: 'After my first few overs, if May (Peter, the captain) hadn't switched me to the Stretford End and given Lockie the other, you know, I daresay I would not have taken one wicket; Lockie might have had the lot. First over after the switch, I had McDonald caught and then at once clean-bowled the great RN Harvey. I was on my way.' Harvey b Laker 0 Might that one wicket have been the most potent delivery of all the century? It was, after all, the trumpeting Elgar-like overture to Laker's unassailably glorious and, surely, unbeatable nineteen-wicket Test match sackful which, for this book's purpose, must be the most voluptuous and glitteringly sustained one-match bowling feat of the century - well, what can match it really be, but Massie's one-off? - and however much the Manchester groundsman might have helped, he wasn't at the time actually bowling or digging ditches at the other. Tony Lock was, seething with jealousy and fury the while, and he ended with just the solitary twentieth wicket. So possibly - well, mischievously - Burke c Cowdrey b Lock Might even, for those judges of a nicely perverse nature, be the delivery of the century. Not long after Laker, the one-shot bingo, blast-'em-for-pace era was upon us. Like Larwood and Lindwall and Constantine before him, Frank Tyson had blown a thrilling gale and now, together, did Hall and Griffith, and later Lillee and Thomson. Then they began to hunt in fours. Not so good. The Batsman's Fear of the Battery. Armour and helmets came in, with only sheer courage inside them; subtlety went out the pav windows. Soon, the fast bowlers were not simply making inroads for the spin bowlers, with deft cunning, to continue the infiltration, but captains were happy with sometimes five unvaried bumper-bowlers of out-and-out nasty, ramparts-blasting pace. From behind the ropes, anyway, the eye could not follow the arrow, and the interminable, relentless legend was once more wearily inked-in - c Marsh b Lillee... c Murray b Holding... and on and on. So as the century neared its end, there came upon us, unheralded and quite astonishingly out of the blue, the most dappily unlikely young man from Melbourne with peroxide hair, an insouciant charm and a carefree smile which could light up the day. All cricket had, by now, long mournfully presumed that the art of spin bowling had, with just one or two last-gasp exceptions, died with the retirement of, as the affectionately yearning Christmas carol spoof had it: We three tweaks of orient are Bedi, Venkat, Chandrasekhar This new fellow had hitherto, and ludicrously, only a paltry fourteen first-class wickets in his locker, and in his first Test match, against India in New Year's week, 1992, at Sydney, the selectors were dumbed and humiliated by his figures of 45-7- 150-1. For romantics, however, that solitary wicket will remain something to savour far into this upcoming century: Shastri c Jones b Warne 206 At that moment of Shastri's being caught, the seemingly dead art and craft and science and daring of the leg-spin and googly bowler could be said to have been vibrantly revived, single-handed, by the nous and skill and joie de vivre of Shane Warne. An apt century's anniversary too, for Australians have always called the googly (the disguised sleight-of-wrist which turns a seemingly delivered leg-break into a bamboozling 'offie') a 'bosie', after its inventor and first practitioner, the English public schoolboy Bernard Bosanquet. Dramatic unities are precisely served, for Bosanquet's first public experiment with the delivery took a wicket in the very first spring of the century, in May 1900 at Lord's, when a bemused Sammy Coe of Leicestershire was stumped by the proverbial mile. Bosie took his invention to Australia with Pelham Warner's England team of 1903. In the first afternoon of the first Test at Sydney on 11 December, Warner gave him a first bowl against the Australian champion who looked set for a big score: Armstrong b Bosanquet 48 And Bosanquet's wristy-twisty joke went on to clinch the series and win the Ashes for England on the return to Sydney in February when he took 6 for 51 as the home side was skittled for 171. So in celebration, let the Ball of the Century be decided by the leggies - and before opening the envelope, the shortlist is announced as: Trumper st Hayes b Mailey 8, Sydney 1906 The twenty-year-old Arthur Mailey bowled two leg-breaks to his hero, Victor Trumper. Both went for sumptuous fours through extra cover. Next, he tried the googly. Howzee! 'As he walked past me,' wrote Mailey, 'he patted the back of his bat and said, \"It was too good for me.\" There was no triumph in me as I watched the receding figure. I felt like a boy who had killed a dove.' Woolley b Grimmett 46, Sydney 1925 England had won the fourth Test by an innings, and Australia gave an unlikely debut to a wizened and weather-beaten, thirty-four-year-old, coot-bald leggie who walked up to the wicket like Charlie Chaplin. Answering 295, England were past 100 and proceeding well enough through Woolley and Hearne when Australia introduced its fourth bowler. In his second over, Grimmett tried the googly. Photographs show the left-hander Woolley in a fearful pickle - as he misses the ball, he has pirouetted on his right leg in the crease by ninety degrees and is now facing leg slip and attempting to play the ball one-handed. Having introduced himself, Grimmett ended with 5 for 45. Bradman c Duleepsinhji b Peebles 14, Old Trafford 1930 The merciless Don had scored 131, 254 and 334 in his first innings in the series' previous three Tests. At Manchester England called up young Ian Peebles. Bradman at once hit him for a rasping boundary. 'Next ball, he came down the wicket for the same off-drive,' wrote Peebles. 'It turned, nicked to second slip and Duleep made no mistake. A roar went up which lasted for a full minute. I had fulfilled my purpose. I heard later that the well-known artist named Nevinson had returned to these shores that very day, in the midst of a bank crisis and various other Government disasters, to find, much to his disgust, that all the evening newspaper headlines said simply, \"PEEBLES DOES IT!\"' Hardstaff b O'Reilly 11, Headingley 1938 Young Joe beguilingly drove 'the Tiger' for two successive fours, the second of which Frank Chester had called 'no ball', an added insult to O'Reilly's injury. 'Thus enraged,' wrote Jack Pollard in his Australian Cricket History, 'O'Reilly bounced up to the crease next ball, arms flailing, wrists cocked, face strained in anger ... and knocked back Hardstaff's stumps with a vicious leg-break! The Australians believed umpire Chester had won the game for them.' Bradman considered O'Reilly the best bowler of his time: 'To hit him for four would arouse a belligerent ferocity, almost like disturbing a hive of bees.' Cardus thought he was better than Barnes as the bowler of the century because O'Reilly's repertoire included a hissing cobra-strike of a googly. (Sir Neville put this point to Barnes once. 'It's quite true. I never had the googly,' admitted Barnes then, after a pause and a twinkle in the keen, steely eyes, he added: 'I never needed it.') I never saw O'Reilly bowl, of course, but have enough old sepia newsreel on video to get the message. He approached the wicket with no nonsense, no finery - all venom and malevolence. Just like his journalism and his views of modern cricketers. Robertson-Glasgow described his run-up as 'a sort of fierce galumph, the right forearm working like a piston, at delivery the head ducked low as if to butt the batsman at the bowler's end onto the stumps'. Bradman b Hollies 0, The Oval 1948 Picked for the fifth Test, Hollies had bowled to Bradman in Warwickshire's county match against the Aussie tourists only a few days before. 'Don't show him your googly, Eric,' urged his county captain Dollery to the tubby, Pershore-cheeked leg-spinner, 'and when you get to The Oval, only show it to him second ball.' Hollies obeyed orders to the letter - as John Arlott described to the nation in his BBC wireless commentary, which can still be recited, by heart and word perfect, by no end of schoolboys of that generation. Well, this one anyway. The recital demands an attempt at least of the beloved Arlott burr: .... here's Hollies, then, from the Vauxhall End ... and Bradman goes back across his wicket and pushes the ball in the direction of the Houses of Parliament, which are out beyond mid-off. It doesn't go that far, it merely goes to Watkins at silly mid-off. No run, still 117 for 1. Two slips, a silly mid-off, and a forward short-leg, close to him ... as Hollies pitches the ball up ... and he's bowled! ... Bradman, bowled Hollies, nought ... Well, what do you say in such circumstances? I wonder if you see a ball very clearly in your last Test in England ... and the opposing team has just stood around and given you three cheers... I wonder if you really see the ball at all?' John Arlott's lyrical immediacy sealed the legend that Bradman's last-Test duck was caused by sentimental tears in the great batsman's eyes - and many years later I mentioned this to the England fieldsman at first slip that day in 1948, doughty Jack Crapp of Gloucester. 'Tears? That bugger Bradman never had a tear in his eye in all his life,' scoffed Jack. May b Benaud 0, Old Trafford 1961 England packed the batting (Close, Pullar, Subba Row) with lefthanders to counter Richie Benaud's leg-breaks. Just before tea on the last day, England needed only 106 at a run a minute with nine wickets left. Then Benaud's extravagant turners into the rough gobbled up four for nine in four overs, including the captain Peter May, round his legs, for an ignominious duck. Australia kept the Ashes. 'When you try something and it comes off, it gives you a very good feeling,' admitted the ever laconic Benaud. Randall c &amp; b Qadir 7, Hyderabad 1978 The bounding, soon-to-be-great Abdul Qadir had nervously introduced himself to England in the first Test on a low, slow pitch at Lahore three weeks before, but with just a solitary wicket (Willis, no less!), Brearley's Englishmen sniffed no dangers. In the second Test at Hyderabad, Boycott, Brearley and Rose had together posted a calm enough 130 for 3 when Qadir came on as fifth change. In his first over, Randall fidgeted back, forward, and back again to give a return dolly, and at once Roope did almost exactly the same. England all out for 191, Qadir on his way with 6 for 44. He ended with 236 Test wickets; a match-winner, he took five in an innings fifteen times, ten in a match five times - better than O'Reilly and Benaud, but not as 'striking' as Barnes or Grimmett. After every one of those 236, Qadir would offer gratitude, simply and with a shy smile, 'to the Maker'. It can be no sacrilege to surmise that the Muslim nature embraces the legspinner's mystique. Thus it is a pity that in terms of cricket, England's national religion inspires bowlers mostly to be, as another crafty 'legger' Ian Peebles used to complain, 'just good old straight up and down, no nonsense, military medium, Church of England trundling.' After that first Test wicket for plenty against India, the young Australian Shane Warne was persevered with by the Australian selectors and had won plaudits enough in two following short series - not least from rival batsmen and captains Richie Richardson of the West Indies and Martin Crowe of New Zealand - to be assured of his inclusion for the 1993 Ashes tour to England. I had been commissioned to write a detailed profile of the Australian tour manager and former captain, Bobby Simpson, and caught up with him and his side, captained by Allan Border, at the first opportunity at the traditional pipe-opener at Worcester. Warne was picked to play and my initial reaction, voiced to Simpson and Border at a convivial party down by the Severn on the eve of the match, was to question the wisdom of throwing the tyro in at once against England's perceived star bat who had wintered well. Indeed, Graeme Hick of Worcestershire certainly was pawing the earth determined to consolidate his suddenly reawarded five-star rating. Border replied, almost callously, 'Sure, it might upset his confidence if he doesn't put the ball on the right spot and Graeme gets a pile of runs off him; then it will be a taste of what will happen to our young leggie if he doesn't get it right.' The feeling was that Border had gone quietly bonkers, when Warne dished up a diet of gently turning, lollipop leggies all pitching around or outside off-stump. Hick clocked him all over the apple-blossom orchards for a mega-century, hitting 96 off seventy-seven balls from Warne. Over the next few weeks it became clear to me that a devious and delicious plot was being hatched. At Worcester, and at other grounds where England possibles were batting, those commiserating, worry-pot bits of advice and condolence which Border was giving his young spinner from mid-off, as they waited for the ball to be retrieved from the adjoining pastures, were nothing of the sort. What the captain was insisting was that Warne stuck resolutely to The Game Plan: toss down gentle coddlers and keep the repertoire under your top hat for the real show. Warne was kept under wraps through the international one-day games - where a carefree and still unsuspecting Robin Smith went brilliantly barmy. The match before the first Test was at Leicester. Last afternoon, the county trying to bat out time. No hope. On came Warne for a lengthy pre-Test bowl. Wowzee! The full works. Three Leicestershire fellows were bowled round their legs, although they were probably none the wiser, such a tizz were they in from the mesmerizing mix of wrong'uns, fizzing flippers and top-spinners. Few at the Leicester ground that afternoon took much notice - its local football team, the City, were involved in a crucial First Division play-off match at Wembley and one's first feeling was that its county batsmen were, in fact, making fools of themselves out in the middle the quicker to get back to the dressing-room TV and the soccer. Till I heard one of them - Vince Wells, I think - come in muttering, 'I've never seen anything like that before.' Warne's figures were 25-12-58- 6; it was just the private dress-rehearsal Simpson and Border needed from him for the Test match two days later, and this is what I filed to the Guardian from Leicester that evening: 'Two or three batsmen rolled back to the pavilion in a daze of eyerolling double-takes after being scrambled and poached by an outrageous right-angled extravagance which dips in serenely to land on the uncut edges of the strip far outside the left peg before snapping back a full yard to nip away the off-bail. 'A rare bird, Warne stands out more luminously for his peroxide haircut and electric-blue wraparound sunglasses. Handed the ball, he gives the thing a real tweak off an upright approach. Sleeves down, demeanour keen and unafraid, he gives a shine of the ball on his left buttock then transfers it in the middle of a jauntily busy three-pace walk and then one springy bound and it is whirring down at the bat. 'His aim is more middle-and-leg than off-stump for, though his flipper can hurry through, the wrong'un is less well disguised. Gatting and Hick especially will be the two detailed to dismantle Warne's cocksure confidence at Old Trafford. It could be an intriguing passage when Border first tosses him the ball.' I have (I assure you) very seldom been so prescient. Two days later, the first Test at Manchester began well for England. Australia were bowled out for 289 in their first innings and, in reply, Gooch and Atherton reached an untroubled and promising 71 for the first wicket before Hughes had the latter caught behind the wicket. In strode England's acknowledged champion against spin, Mike Gatting - tubby, truculent, bearded and, as ever, bristling with intent to get on with it like a youngish Henry VIII on first spotting Anne Boleyn. Immediately the Australian captain threw down the gauntlet and summoned Warne into the attack. An expectant stirring, a frisson, stimulated the packed throng. It was Gatting's first ball, and also Warne's very first in an Ashes series. Captain Graham Gooch was the batsman at the other end and he remembers: 'You just presumed Warne would begin with a loosener, most bowlers do. No chance. He just walked up and I heard it flick from his hand. The delivery hovered down on the line of Mike's pads and then it seemed to hang and dip in the air even further towards the leg side. Now if Mike had been well set, and not just arrived at the crease, I'm still convinced at that stage the ball would have been meat-and-drink to him and he'd have treated it just like it looked - an overpitched leg- side cheese roll to be whacked without ceremony over deep midwicket and into the crowd. But quite rightly, in a Test when you're a new bat and he's a new bowler, you just want to have a look-see, get a feel yourself and also check what the bowler's about. So as the ball floated down, now looking as if it would pitch almost outside the width of the crease, Mike was content enough just to push out, cover up if it happened to turn a bit, or let it continue floating innocuously down leg side to the keeper. 'Then the ball pitched. It gripped the turf, and it turned a good foot, possibly more, almost at right-angles. In a fizzing blur it ripped past his bat and across Mike's body - and plucked away the off-bail as crisp and sweet as a nut. Bloody hell, I could hardly believe it. Certainly Mike couldn't. He just stood there in half-forward defensive mode, totally transfixed, sort of half-whistling through his beard at such an ambush.

Paul Pressler, president of Walt Disney Attractions, told us it was an \"absolutely beautiful and spectacular setting\", but I couldn't see it myself. But then there was that terminal. I still rage about Southampton's Ocean Terminal. Opened by Clement Attlee in 1950, it was razed by my home town's philistines 17 years ago. But with the Disney Company, nothing need be final: when you wish upon a star, doesn't matter who you are, resurrection is always a possibility. I never got inside the real Ocean Terminal, but that day last October, I got inside Disney's re-creation. The shape of Southampton's sole essay into 30s modern had been sampled, clad in glass, filled with light. I could not rid myself of the suspicion that Disney had first read my mind, then willed the terminal into existence. Late that afternoon, there was a reception. A septet, togged up in 18th-century powder-blue outfits and white wigs, worked through a repertoire somewhere between Michael Nyman and pop-go-the-classics. I met an amiable Mid-Western professorish man who turned out to be Goofy. Well, he was the man who voices Goofy. He did Pluto, too, he observed, and barked. It was a reception before the \"christening\" of Disney Wonder, the Disney Cruise Line's second 83,000-ton cruise ship and destined to ply its trade between Canaveral and the Bahamas. Tinkerbell from Peter Pan was doing the job, one of the many big British stars - Pooh, Poppins, Hood - who years ago switched empires and accents, and quit the British childhood franchise for big money Disneyside. Since Tinkerbell was never much of a talker, Mickey Mouse MCed for her. In the dusk, the fairy's light flew around the hull while fireworks erupted, cascaded and crackled. The sound of When You Wish Upon A Star, the Internationale of the Walt Disney Company, floated across the water and into the billowing smoke around the ship. \"A dream is a wish your heart makes,\" was sung, I think by the Little Mermaid, \"when you are fast asleep.\" But a dream is a wish the Disney Company makes when their executives, planners, \"imagineers\" and accountants are wide awake. And they are always wide awake. The terminal was no more than a minutely-researched allusion, a historical quotation to illustrate the backcloth for Disney Wonder and its sister Disney Magic. The cruise ships are themselves pastiche 30s transatlantic liners, mock twin red funnels and all, destined to sail a few hundred miles out from Florida, an optional extra for visitors based 90 miles away at the \"Walt Disney World Resort\" at Lake Buena Vista. And the World is where I went. It is the core of the Disney universe, 47 square miles - twice the size of Manhattan - with four theme parks, three water adventure parks, 27 hotels, six golf courses, the Downtown Disney entertainment park, a sports complex and a place where you can get married. In 1998, 1.6 million British tourists went there. We love Disney World. Mouse hit the phone on my first morning. I had booked an alarm call. \"Up and at 'em pal!\" squawked the voice down the line. \"Big doin's going on! So let's get started!\" I slammed down the receiver. In the bathroom, I contemplated the soap. It was boxed. On the box was Mouse, black and white, up and at 'em, in red and yellow shorts. Staring eyes, grinning, he was juggling soap, making bubbles. On the back of the box was a quote from the Mickey Mouse Club dated to 1955. \"Everybody neat and pretty?\" it asked. \"Then on with the show!\" Stay neat and pretty, I reckon, and you can do anything. In the Africa section of Disney's Animal Kingdom, the staff were dressed in Gap meets Where No Vultures Fly imperial costume. Pausing in the East African coastal town of \"Harambe\", I slipped into the gents and momentarily anticipated the pungent, challenging bouquet of third-world urinals. Foolishness indeed; beyond the baked-mud synthetic exterior, through the ancient door was The Rest Room From Middle America Mall. The nearby Kilimanjaro Safari, complete with zebras, rhinos, giraffes et al , was dramatised around the threat of elephant poachers; over in the Asia section's Kali River Rapids, pesky loggers were the problem. Nature must not be left to its own devices, because nature recognises no control - as Hurricane Floyd had just demonstrated by wrecking Disney's Bahamian holiday island. A world mediated through Disney is one that provides clean lavatories, artificially-inseminated drama, beginnings, middles and ends. Thus are vanishing species, within that theme park logic, a good thing. Hurry there now while stocks of white rhinos last! At the end of the safari ride, we discovered the poachers' Land Rover (again authentic product placement, just like the magnificently-decorated Bedford lorry in the Asia section) guarded by a \"Kenyan\" who looked, I thought, curiously like a real Colombian guerrilla from south of the border. Reality, or at least alternative fantasies, can intrude. Observing a bored lion, I conjured up my own East African characters to divert him: a group of beastly white-mischiefmakers perhaps, surprised en flagrante, with gin bottles, Illustrated London Newses and a carelessly-concealed Webley Service Revolver. Then there was Animal Kingdom's unfortunately titled Countdown to Extinction. But there were no white rhinos. Instead, we were to count out dinosaurs, experienced \"thanks to a generous grant from the McDonald's Corporation\" - outside funding is the Disney secret. \"It's fast. It's a blast. It's in the past.\" And thus did a 1930s Amazing Science Fiction-style \"time transport loading bay\" introduce a rogue scientist and a tunnel full of tyrannosauri. In the middle of Hollywood, I stood outside Grauman's Chinese Theater. It looked just like it did in old black-and-white Oscar-night newsreels only in colour, if you take my meaning, when they had real stars. Across the sunlit boulevard was the Brown Derby restaurant where people like Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford probably ate steak in that other place, time and dimension before the eaterie retuned its menu to counter multiple cholesterol scares. It was a sunny lunchtime and On the Street Where You Live was playing through the PA - well it wasn't playing, the sidewalk seemed to exude it. Grauman's promised \"a spectacular ride into the movies\". In street-scene Hollywood, all was tranquillity with tourists grazing on ice cream. Inside Grauman's, with its animated wax and flesh, all hell let loose. There were bootleggers blazing away at each other - the plot line had a hood joining the ride - followed by cowboys blazing away at each other. I wrote \"the key to America is the gun\" in my notebook. Then Bergman and Bogart showed up, followed by Garland and the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man and Sigourney Weaver and the Alien. A great movie-clip sequence climaxed the trip, and I came out thinking about my note and looking round at the grazers and pondering cowardly lions, tin men and a Hollywood half a continent away in Los Angeles which succumbed to deprivation, discrimination and urban violence. Who needed real LA? Inside the gates of Disney Florida, Hollywood deprivation, discrimination and bad housing are excluded, and the public enemies, good guys and plain misunderstood, all shoot blanks. At those gates, people gather as they do at shrines to the Virgin Mary in other lands. But in those places, the Virgin never does personal appearances, and no miracles are performed. In Disney World, not only are there miracles, but at Disney-MGM they show how they do them at Backlot Tours. It is, as the Muppets put it at the Muppetvision show, \"a salute to all nations - but mostly America\", a place where, amid the money and the package tours, the poor and the desperately ill take a day out of their lives, while the amazingly plump are trolleyed through the gates. What the whole world needs, I speculated, is theme park treatment, and gates. Magic Kingdom was the original Disney World theme park, and it opened in 1971. Disney-MGM opened in 1989, and Animal Kingdom less than two years ago. And then there is Epcot - the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow - a late dream from Walt Disney, the man, which opened in 1978, 12 years after his death. The late British cartoonist David Low is quoted in the company bio of Walt describing the creator of Mouse as \"the most significant figure in graphic arts since Leonardo\". But Da Vinci only had a workshop, Walt had a corporation. On a landing between the third and fourth deck of Disney Wonder, there is a big 1932 photograph of Walter Elias Disney (1901-1966). He is in black-and-white co-respondent shoes, dark hair macassared back, a David Niven moustache, white shirt with a huge collar, white tennis flannels. He stares into the camera, eyes wide open, quizzical, perfectly in control, the great cultural dictator. In another Disney Wonder photograph of Walt, taken with his wife two years later on some liner deck, he swings Mouse by the leg. Mouse, upside down, seems to glower, no respect. The Mouse was, still is, after all, the front-man, but then Disney was the genius, the man who told the people what they wanted and then gave it to them. A Bill Gates with an artistic vision. Disney gave the people Snow White and Toscanini. Nowadays, they get the Animator's Palate on Disney Wonder, a restaurant whose black-and-white sketch decor shades into colour as the meal progresses - it should have won the Turner Prize - and Philip Glass, live at Epcot's Innoventions Plaza. It was the night before they launched the point of it all, the \"Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration\", the event that obviated the need for your celebrations last night. With Mouse's gloved hand waving from behind the vast Spaceship Earth globe, and lasers, and blue, red, yellow waterfalls all around, Glass's minimalism surged over the Plaza. A New Yorker sprung to her feet. \"At last!\" she cried, \"mass America meets the avant-garde!\" I looked around; mass America was sadly minimal. There were maybe 50 of the vast, invited crowd nearby. The maximalists had fanned out around World Showcase and Test Track and the Living Seas and hot sushi and guacamole and jumbo strawberries. \"Okay,\" she said. \"But it's a start.\" And there was the tree in Animal Kingdom. It dominated the landscape and, long after Disney has gone, I proclaimed, the Tree would survive. In reality, the Tree of Life is concrete, 18 months of sculptors' work, shaped out of the forms of hundreds of animals. Three months ago, down by Epcot's \"World Showcase Lagoon\", the Walt Disney Company launched its Millennium Village, which offers potted versions of \"world cultures\" from small nations; the nightly Tapestry of Nations which I expected to be some kind of parade; and IllumiNations 2000, said to be the world's largest nightly firework show. The Lagoon is ringed by national pavilions - Japan, Norway, Germany et al. Pre-launch, the Village had teething problems. The kind that come when reality bites the Disney bum. The Arab states denounced the Israeli foreign ministry's film at the Israel exhibit for apparently proclaiming Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It didn't by the time I got to it. Quite dire, inadvertently reminiscent of the The Fast Show - Jerusalem? Fantastic! Faith! - it was just over the way from Saudi Arabia, where Sony touchscreen search by topic offered Henna, Haj and Desert. I couldn't find Beheadings. The launch ceremony itself featured a Disney spokesman on \"bringing the world together through understanding\". It was just unfortunate timing-wise. Over in Millennium Village, Indonesia was \"celebrating the artists of the world\"; elsewhere it was bringing East Timor together by burning it down. At the launch, a UN undersecretary for communications quoted Oscar Wilde and other dead sages. I brooded on the US's failure to pay its $1.6 billion back subs to the UN. Then on came Maya Angelou, who hit out in various languages by proclaiming \"we are more alike than we are unalike\". Cute kids sang about sharing a dream of the future. It was the kind of morning that drops a jaw like Terror Tower shifts an elevator. It did not bode well for the parade. Late that afternoon, I made it to the British Pavilion on World Showcase Lagoon. It was an ordinary kind of British day. I ate fish and chips from the Yorkshire chippie opposite Hampton Court and drank ice-cold Bass from the Rose and Crown (no under-21s served alcohol). A fellow was mashing apples for cider, as they do, by the tea-shop, and the Beatles were singing I Saw Her Standing There on the village green. I crossed the bridge into France for the parade. The noise hit first, vast percussion units, then puppets, performers on stilts, flares. Sounds and colour changed as it passed. I speculated on how many art historians, designers, painters Disney had recruited. I thought of medieval carnivals, Notting Hill and Brazil, the French Revolution's Thermidor and the vast f tes for the Supreme Being and the Republic. The Tapestry of Nations, a f&amp;#egrave;te for consumers and by a corporation, was art and induced emotion on the streets, but then Disney had created the streets, too. The Princess Di effect, I realised, could be induced. The fireworks were impressive, the parade had been staggering. Afterwards, I walked on past lamb-roasting and fire-dancers in Morocco, Lord of the Dance in America, bratwurst in Germany, but no whale in Norway. In the night, reality didn't bite. I had arrived in another world. Specifically, an Italy of La Dolce Vita and Fellini, Roma with carabinieri and Alfas and people in the square eating huge bowls of pasta and a trio singing Volare, just like they always should in Italy. I glimpsed a woman roaming through the crowds, product placement clearly extended to Commedia dell'Arte. She was wearing a mask that could have been 18th century, could have been the Borgias. It stopped me dead. She glanced at me. The mask was timeless. The mask was reality.

How would you feel if you were in the other person's position? Would you feel your actions fair and justified? This approach is as relevant at an individual level as for companies and governments. The approach would reduce the risks of conflict and the power of dictators, and help reduce inequalities in the world. This practical recipe was stated about 2,000 years ago as \"do unto others as you would they should do unto you\". Wish best wishes for a new millennium that can be fair and happy for everyone. John Chubb Cheltenham • I'd like to think that the next 1,000 years would mark a turning point in our relationship with our collective home. That power and the amassing of material wealth, at the expense of natural wealth, would become a thing of the past. That we would look beyond our own short and futile lives. However, that is not going to happen. We have nothing to celebrate and nothing to look forward to. There is no future for the human race and we don't deserve one. Simply by living the lives we do, we each play an active part in the death of all that supports life on earth and the things which should make that life enjoyable. My hope is that when we go, we won't drag everything else down with us. Alexander Fitch London • The past millennium has seen the human population multiplied sixfold and the number of continents known to western man double from three to six. Man has crossed and plumbed the oceans, conquered the air and despite mishaps at Mars, made his first faltering steps into the wider universe. My hope is that the next century will see a self-sustaining daughter civilisation established off the Earth, both as necessary life insurance against catastrophic climatic changes, but, more positively, as an essential first step to fulfilling the true potential of our restless species - the mental development of the cosmos. My hope for the new millennium is that we do not allow those who would reduce us to the animal kingdom or who would, out of misguided misanthropy, confine us to Earth, procure the abortion known as a static growth-limited \"utopia\". Dr Michael Martin-Smith Hull • In 1941, Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet, wrote a poem to his friend Satyajit Ray: \"I have spent a fortune travelling to distant shores and looked at lofty mountains and boundless oceans, and yet I haven't found time to take a few steps from my house to look at a single dew drop on a single blade of grass.\" An aspiration for the world is to begin to harness our insatiable appetites for more and more of what is not needed and to slow down and take time to discover that single dew drop. Judith Dell London • I hope the human race can evolve and realise that armed conflict never solved any of the world's problems.

Hushed and perfectly still, the first men and women on earth to see in the millennium did so silently and in prayer, each one holding a candle. They stood on their tiny island in the south Pacific, with only a starlit sky above them. It was an elemental sight: God's children, massed on a hilltop, gazing toward the heavens - ushering in the new era. They were the people of the tiny Fijian kingdom of Taveuni, whose unique position on the 180-degree line of longitude made their midnight the first anywhere in the world. And their response was to give thanks. They were barely interested in the official midnight event, held just down the road at Waiyevo, the town sliced in two by the the international dateline that separates east from west, today from yesterday. The crowd there was thin, with only tourists and foreign TV crews interested in ten-nine-eight countdowns or Auld Langs Syne. Instead the islanders headed up the hill to Wairiki, site of Taveuni's grand, imposing Catholic mission. There they formed a huge human carpet under the planetarium-clear stars. Torches in their hand, they made their very own constellation of light. With pride, the priest declared in Fijian and English that this open-air mass would be the very first act of worship of the new century. The prospect of being first had drawn travellers from all over the world to Taveuni, the super-rich jetting in on tiny seaplanes - a persistent rumour claimed that Bill Gates had moored his yacht off a private island: the ultimate millennium man, eager to see in the new era - along with the backpackers from Auckland and Edinburgh, Sydney and San Francisco, their hearts filled with hope for the dawning of the age of aquarius. All of them had come to stand at the easternmost point on the planet, the meridian that marks the border between the far, far east and the ultra-west. The line touches land in only a handful of places, and Taveuni is the only inhabited one of the bunch. That is why the Fijians insisted, despite the protests of rivals in Kiribati and Tonga, that the first midnight of the new century arrived earlier here than anywhere else. On this palm-fringed island the third millennium made its debut. It was an appropriate spot, and not just because it gave the TV crews dotted around Tavenui the postcard pictures they wanted to beam home. There seemed something fitting about all those western eyes swivelling east for the start of the new era. For more than a decade, corporate chiefs have told their staff: look to the Pacific Rim. The future is supposed to lie in this region, with China the coming superpower. The east will have the population numbers and, before long, the economic heft to run the planet. The United States will tear itself apart or pollute itself out of existence: global warming could see the White House, just a few feet above sea-level now, disappear underwater. Perhaps the third millennium will be shaped right here, in the place where it started. But there are no guarantees. When the year 999 turned into 1000, the experts of the day would also have named the Chinese as future masters of the universe. They had invented gunpowder, printing and cast iron; surely the next 1,000 years would belong to them. But the prophets had not banked on Europe or the Americas. Who will be the Medicis and the Rockefellers of the era begun this morning? The truth, illustrated so beautifully in the coral islands of Fiji and beyond, is that none of us can know. Look how wrong we all were about 2000. Most of the futurologists predicted two possible scenarios for the 21st century. Either we would all be wearing space suits, living in antisceptic skyscrapers munching on tablets for dinner. Or we would be savages running amok in a post-nuclear wasteland, bombed back to the stone age. It would be Brave New World or Mad Max. Nature would have been abolished, or we would have been forced back to its most basic state. But to see the sunrise from a boat bobbing on the blue Fijian ocean tells a different story. It says we did not make nature irrelevant: the beauty, and value, of the coconut trees and the banana plants on the shoreline prove otherwise. Nor did we wreck the civilisation we built. Atom bombs were tested here in the south Pacific, yet the south Pacific refused to be destroyed. As January 1 dawned, the ocean remained clear and rich in sunlit turquoise - ready to give the human race another chance. There were some TV cameras to record the moment, of course, but not many. The island was not overrun by the Y2K industry. Instead, a very elemental kind of excitement coursed through Tavenui, one that owed less to millennial hype and more to the sense that a unique milestone had been reached. No matter that it was a man-made invention - longitude and the business of counting centuries are both artificial constructs - there was a mystical charge in the air. Stripped of the hoopla, the first winking light of the millennium did send an ethereal shiver down the spine. This was a direct encounter with time, not the day-to-day stuff of catching buses and making appointments, but big time, the time that has ticked away since the beginning of the universe. Just as the first photograph of the planet taken from space in the 1960s forced humankind to see itself in a new light - as co-tenants of a single, finite and luminous entity - so the arrival of the new millennium seemed poised to evoke a similar, profound reaction. A thousand years is unimaginable except through the eyes of future generations. It implies responsibility. What that earth photo did for space, 2000 might do for time, making us realise how small our place is in it. Seeing the earth as a whole forced us to see how petty were the boundaries between us. Is it too optimistic to imagine that this morning's dawn could have a similar effect? The new era is meant to be the one of globalisation, and this morning's celebration was truly global.

In remarks which were immediately condemned by Labour, the shadow foreign secretary John Maples, called on the government to moderate its criticism of the Russians despite their ferocious bombardment of the Chechen capital Grozny. Speaking on Sky News, Mr Maples said: \"We ought to be careful of the tone in which we criticise the Russians because there is nothing we can do about it. The Russians are set upon the policy they are pursuing. The sooner they are successful, the better.\" Mr Maples added that reports of chemical weapons being used by the Chechen rebels showed that the conflict would be brutal. \"All the west can do is try to persuade the Russians to seek a negotiated settlement... and to do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of refugees,\" Mr Maples said. Labour seized on the latest Tory blunder, which appeared to endorse the Russian assault on Grozny, even though it has been condemned worldwide. Gerald Kaufman, a former shadow foreign secretary, dismissed Mr Maples' remarks. \"It is fortunate that the views of the Conservative party do not count for anything. If they did, the thoughtless statement by John Maples could do serious damage to international efforts to bring the fighting to an end,\" he said. \"It sounds as though he believes the only course of action is a victory by arms. That is not the policy of the United Nations, that is not the policy of the United Kingdom and it should not be the policy of any responsible politician.\" A Tory spokesman insisted last night that Mr Maples stood by his remarks. Tories also pointed out that no minister had responded to Mr Maples because he had spoken the uncomfortable truth. However, Mr Maples's indelicate use of language is likely to raise questions about his future in the shadow cabinet. He is seen as one of the weakest members of Mr Hague's frontbench team and could be eased out later this year to make way for Michael Portillo. Mr Maples's blunder came as Steven Norris added his voice to the growing band of Tory heavyweights who have called on Mr Hague to avoid a lurch to the right. Mr Norris, the frontrunner to win the Tory nomination for the London mayoral election, said Mr Hague should steer clear of \"cheap cheers\" which alienate mainstream voters. \"It is natural for parties to want to regress to what they regard as their heartlands,\" Mr Norris told Radio 4's World This Weekend. \"I think that is a temptation which has to be avoided. You get a great cheer at your party conference but you will be addressing an ever-diminishing audience.\" \"If the Tories were to move back to a hardline, rightwing, law and order party that was nationalistic, antipathetic to minorities and so on then it might appeal to a very small section of the population. \"But it will never appeal to the 40% of the population it needs if it is to win power.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/04/thatcher.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-04T01:16:36Z","webTitle":"Hague off the hook as Tory MP denies plans to defect","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/04/thatcher.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/04/thatcher.uk","fields":{"headline":"Hague off the hook as Tory MP denies plans to defect","bodyText":"William Hague won a brief respite yesterday when the maverick Tory MP, Teresa Gorman, denied that she was planning to defect to the anti-European United Kingdom Independence party. Amid speculation that Mrs Gorman, MP for Billericay, was planning to jump ship, she issued a brief statement saying: 'I have absolutely no plans to apply for membership of the UK Independence party.' Her intervention, after recent disclosures that she has been in discussions with the UKIP, gave some comfort to the Tory leadership still reeling from Shaun Woodward's defection to Labour. However, her terse statement, which failed to criticise the UKIP or praise her own party, did little to dampen speculation that she might eventually defect. The MP is understood to be angry with Mr Hague after she was blocked from contesting the Tory nomination for London mayor. Membership of the UKIP could provide her with a useful platform in May's mayoral election. Nigel Farage, the UKIP chair-man who is one of the party's three Euro MPs, insisted last night that he was still involved in negotiations with Conservative MPs and peers, and he was confident that at least one would jump ship. Mr Farage refused to name the MP believed to be one of the 'whipless eight', the hardline Eurosceptics who had the Conservative whip withdrawn by John Major in 1994. Mr Farage said: 'I think things will happen over the next couple of weeks. I think that because there is a large element now in the Conservative party who are very unhappy with Hague's policy of being in Europe and not run by Europe. They realise that that is not coherent, that the simple choice is that we are either in the European Union and we make the best that we can of it, or we come out.' A defection from the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party would represent a serious blow to Mr Hague who is still recovering from Mr Woodward's defection to Labour. Conservative Central Office dismissed as 'speculative reports' suggestions that the Ruislip Northwood MP, John Wilkinson, had also been in discussions with the UKIP. The prospect of Tory defections came amid renewed splits in the UKIP. Michael Holmes, the party's leader, who has been at loggerheads with Mr Farage, said he had not authorised any meetings with disaffected Tory MPs. 'It is when our party has decided its future that that will be the time to have discreet contacts with people who are, perhaps, dissatisfied,' he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2000/jan/04/highereducation.tuitionfees","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-04T17:53:57Z","webTitle":"Has Cubie killed fees?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/jan/04/highereducation.tuitionfees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/jan/04/highereducation.tuitionfees","fields":{"headline":"Has Cubie killed fees?","bodyText":"Every developed country is struggling to keep pace with the intellectual arms race. They know that if they don't educate more of their citizens to a higher level, they'll fall behind; but they also know there are limits to what taxpayers are willing to shell out for students. It's a perennial issue, which seemed to have quietened down again in Britain once David Blunkett settled on paid tuition fees in the year after Labour was elected. But now it's come charging back up the agenda, and in a way that will probably affect students throughout the United Kingdom. Shortly before Christmas, a report to the Scottish Parliament on student finance was produced in response to the furious political row north of the border over tuition fees and student loans. This week, a small group of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians are trying to thrash out a deal based on the report, to save their ruling coalition in Edinburgh. They have not got much time - in two weeks it is the Scottish Nationalists' turn to choose the subject of debate in the Parliament, and the executive is under pressure to agree a policy by then. But that battle for short-term tactical advantage at Holyrood will have consequences that reverberate far beyond Edinburgh. For the committee chaired by Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie has tried to find a Scottish answer for a global phenomenon - the continuing pressure on funding for higher education. \"Set against a widespread expansion of participation, the main policy issue facing student support for further and higher education is how to bring in private money to the sectors.\" Scotland has taken participation further than the rest of Britain: 47% of young people, and half of all young women, go on to higher education there. But the problem is especially acute for a small nation that is determined to hang on to its four-year degrees. New Labour's answer to the problem was announced in the heady weeks after the 1997 general election victory: means-tested annual tuition fees of £1,000 (this year £1,025) to be paid upfront while students can borrow from the Student Loans Company to cover fees and living costs up to a maximum of £3,635 a year. Repayment starts when the graduate's income reaches £10,000 a year. Crucially, Labour completed the phasing out of grants which the Conservatives began. Blunkett, as incoming education secretary, ignored the recommendations of the Dearing committee to keep some grants and levy contributions from graduates along the lines of the Australian Higher Education Contributions Scheme. Public meetings throughout Scotland and a mass of written evidence left Cubie and his committee in little doubt that fees were extremely unpopular in Scotland and the parental or student contribution ought to be abolished. His report makes uncomfortable reading for Blunkett. The system for funding students was \"ineffective, insufficient and indecipherable\" and many students were taking on high levels of additional paid work that was detrimental to their studies. \"We consider the government unwisely put aside Dearing's recommendations for a graduate contribution and chose an approach which has become unpopular in Scotland. We are clear . . . that the present arrangements are broadly discredited, add to anxieties about debt and create undue anomalies.\" The up-front contribution ought to go, but graduates ought to contribute to the costs of their education, argues the report. \"We are not persuaded that a principle of free education should apply in all circumstances. Indeed, fairness suggests that those who gain from higher education should make an appropriate and timely contribution in respect of the benefits gained. After all, these benefits are significant and not available to all. \"To ensure graduates who benefit from higher education make a contribution towards its future costs, we propose a Scottish Graduate Endowment. However, full-time further and higher education students, other than postgraduates, should have the opportunity to attend college or university without paying tuition fees.\" From 2001, it recommends, students would contract to pay into the endowment fund when their income reaches £25,000. The report sets a total figure of £3,075 to match what current students have to pay. Cubie also blamed Blunkett for not following the lead of Edinburgh ministers and waiving fees for the fourth year of Scottish degree courses. It was up to him to sort out the anomaly, not the Scots: \"The decision by ministers elsewhere in the UK not to respect this principle on the issue of the fourth-year anomaly led to a discrediting of tuition fees in Scotland. This in turn led, through the political process, to the case for abolition of the tuition fee contribution being put so strongly.\" Blunkett has no intention of spending a penny of his budget on sorting out Scottish anomalies, but any implementation of the Cubie proposals will lead to embarrassing comparisons and could well reopen the fees debate in England, which the government thought it had dealt with. It is not only that students from England will be paying £1,025 more than their Scottish colleagues to study at Scottish universities, and having to pay it upfront. The result is likely to be fewer incoming students. The most recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed a 5% fall in applications from English students, 13% from Wales, and more than 4% from Northern Ireland. (The number of Scots who wanted to study in their own country fell by just 1.8%.) Indeed, one well-respected physics department in Scotland is already rewriting its four-year course into three years in response to a drastic fall in applications from over the border. More vital in political terms to Blunkett and other members of the Blair government is whether Scotland comes up with a better system for promoting the increase in participation they have set their sights on. Cubie's case against fees is that they deter the people from poor backgrounds that New Labour wants to draw into the educational fold. Not only should fees be scrapped, but money should be redirected away from loans to well-off families and targeted on bursaries for the poor. In other words, grants should be restored under another name. Although 40% of Scotland's 140,000 full-time higher education students pay no fees at all and a further 30% pay a reduced fee, the Cubie committee was convinced their existence was a deterrent to \"loan averse\" low-income families and mature students. In England, ministers have argued strongly that fees have had no effect on applications, although they have had to admit a drop among mature students. Perhaps it is too soon to judge, but there has certainly been no significant expansion in numbers of people coming forward from the working class and ethnic minority families the government wants to attract. At the same time, there are growing complaints from universities with a lot of these sort of students that financial hardship is making their drop-out rates worse. Labour's majority at Westminster is too large for ministers to need to appease the Liberal Democrats, but Cubie's argument that students from low-income backgrounds will need financial help both at further education college and at university through special bursary schemes will strike a chord with English universities and students. For an \"education, education, education\" government, that could be embarrassing. One of the most significant features of the report is that, although media coverage has centred on university fees, half the discussion and recommendations are about further education colleges - the vital step on the ladder to increased participation. But will Cubie's proposals fare any better in the political arena than Lord Dearing's voluminous report on higher education? Ministers in Scotland are sceptical that Cubie's proposals could be delivered for the £62m extra he claims, rising in subsequent years to £71m, and universities areanxious they could simply lose the fee income without gaining anything in return. On the other hand, Tories have condemned the proposals as simply converting tuition fees into a tuition tax and some LibDems regard the graduate payments as deferred fees. The deal, therefore, is by no means done. But, as a senior Scottish Liberal Democrat backbencher put it: \"Fees are dead - or else the coalition is dead.\" The main ideas Among the report's 52 recommendations are: •Abolish tuition fees for Scottish domiciled students - the Scottish Executive to pick up the estimated £12m shortfall to the sector. • Set up the Scottish Graduate Endowment -all Scottish domiciled and European Union students starting courses from October 2001 will sign a contract to pay £3,075 to the fund once their graduate salary tops £25,000. Ministers should consider early payment incentives. • Ministers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should waive fourth-year fees for Scottish universities as a matter of urgency. • A new body, Student Finance Scotland, to collect and take over wide-ranging responsibilities for student support. • A charitable trust, the Scottish Graduate Endowment Foundation, to provide additional support for higher and further education students, receiving donations from existing graduates, firms or members of the public. • Students genuinely unable to find work during the summer vacation should have access to benefits. • Support for students increased to £4,100 (away from home), £3,240 (living at home) and £5,050 (in London). • Review support for further education students. • Students should be limited to maximum of 10 hours a week paid work in term time. • Three years' bursary support in FE college/school for young people from low-income backgrounds, plus bursaries in higher education equal to half the total support available. • Childcare allowance of £1,500 for lone-parent students. • Disabled student allowance to be open to all higher education students. • Review means test - low- and middle-income parents to pay less and better off pay more. • Wider Access and Mature Students' bursary schemes to target non-repayable support to particularly disadvantaged students - schemes administered by universities and colleges and would absorb current Access Funds. • Better information for prospective students on the internet and in libraries. • Tax breaks as incentives for people to contribute to Individual Learning Accounts. • Review support for postgraduate students. The report of the independent commitee of inquiry into student finance is available on www.studentfinance.org.uk. The four-volume report can also be ordered from bookshops, total price £15.The main ideas"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/04/scotland.devolution1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-04T18:13:38Z","webTitle":"Has Cubie killed fees?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/04/scotland.devolution1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/04/scotland.devolution1","fields":{"headline":"Has Cubie killed fees?","bodyText":"Every developed country is struggling to keep pace with the intellectual arms race.

But now it's come charging back up the agenda, and in a way that will probably affect students throughout the United Kingdom. Shortly before Christmas, a report to the Scottish Parliament on student finance was produced in response to the furious political row north of the border over tuition fees and student loans. This week, a small group of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians are trying to thrash out a deal based on the report, to save their ruling coalition in Edinburgh. They have not got much time - in two weeks it is the Scottish Nationalists' turn to choose the subject of debate in the Parliament, and the executive is under pressure to agree a policy by then. But that battle for short-term tactical advantage at Holyrood will have consequences that reverberate far beyond Edinburgh. For the committee chaired by Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie has tried to find a Scottish answer for a global phenomenon - the continuing pressure on funding for higher education. \"Set against a widespread expansion of participation, the main policy issue facing student support for further and higher education is how to bring in private money to the sectors.\" Scotland has taken participation further than the rest of Britain: 47% of young people, and half of all young women, go on to higher education there. But the problem is especially acute for a small nation that is determined to hang on to its four-year degrees. New Labour's answer to the problem was announced in the heady weeks after the 1997 general election victory: means-tested annual tuition fees of £1,000 (this year £1,025) to be paid upfront while students can borrow from the Student Loans Company to cover fees and living costs up to a maximum of £3,635 a year. Repayment starts when the graduate's income reaches £10,000 a year. Crucially, Labour completed the phasing out of grants which the Conservatives began. Blunkett, as incoming education secretary, ignored the recommendations of the Dearing committee to keep some grants and levy contributions from graduates along the lines of the Australian Higher Education Contributions Scheme. Public meetings throughout Scotland and a mass of written evidence left Cubie and his committee in little doubt that fees were extremely unpopular in Scotland and the parental or student contribution ought to be abolished. His report makes uncomfortable reading for Blunkett. The system for funding students was \"ineffective, insufficient and indecipherable\" and many students were taking on high levels of additional paid work that was detrimental to their studies. \"We consider the government unwisely put aside Dearing's recommendations for a graduate contribution and chose an approach which has become unpopular in Scotland . We are clearÉ that the present arrangements are broadly discredited, add to anxieties about debt and create undue anomalies.\" The up-front contribution ought to go, but graduates ought to contribute to the costs of their education, argues the report. \"We are not persuaded that a principle of free education should apply in all circumstances. Indeed, fairness suggests that those who gain from higher education should make an appropriate and timely contribution in respect of the benefits gained. After all, these benefits are significant and not available to all. \"To ensure graduates who benefit from higher education make a contribution towards its future costs, we propose a Scottish Graduate Endowment. However, full-time further and higher education students, other than postgraduates, should have the opportunity to attend college or university without paying tuition fees .\" From 2001, it recommends, students would contract to pay into the endowment fund when their income reaches £25,000. The report sets a total figure of £3,075 to match what current students have to pay. Cubie also blamed Blunkett for not following the lead of Edinburgh ministers and waiving fees for the fourth year of Scottish degree courses. It was up to him to sort out the anomaly, not the Scots: \"The decision by ministers elsewhere in the UK not to respect this principle on the issue of the fourth-year anomaly led to a discrediting of tuition fees in Scotland . This in turn led, through the political process, to the case for abolition of the tuition fee contribution being put so strongly.\" Blunkett has no intention of spending a penny of his budget on sorting out Scottish anomalies, but any implementation of the Cubie proposals will lead to embarrassing comparisons and could well reopen the fees debate in England, which the government thought it had dealt with. It is not only that students from England will be paying £1,025 more than their Scottish colleagues to study at Scottish universities, and having to pay it upfront. The result is likely to be fewer incoming students. The most recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed a 5% fall in applications from English students, 13% from Wales, and more than 4% from Northern Ireland. (The number of Scots who wanted to study in their own country fell by just 1.8%.) Indeed, one well-respected physics department in Scotland is already rewriting its four-year course into three years in response to a drastic fall in applications from over the border. More vital in political terms to Blunkett and other members of the Blair government is whether Scotland comes up with a better system for promoting the increase in participation they have set their sights on. Cubie's case against fees is that they deter the people from poor backgrounds that New Labour wants to draw into the educational fold. Not only should fees be scrapped, but money should be redirected away from loans to well-off families and targeted on bursaries for the poor. In other words, grants should be restored under another name. Although 40% of Scotland 's 140,000 full-time higher education students pay no fees at all and a further 30% pay a reduced fee, the Cubie committee was convinced their existence was a deterrent to \"loan averse\" low-income families and mature students. In England, ministers have argued strongly that fees have had no effect on applications, although they have had to admit a drop among mature students. Perhaps it is too soon to judge, but there has certainly been no significant expansion in numbers of people coming forward from the working class and ethnic minority families the government wants to attract. At the same time, there are growing complaints from universities with a lot of these sort of students that financial hardship is making their drop-out rates worse. Labour's majority at Westminster is too large for ministers to need to appease the Liberal Democrats, but Cubie's argument that students from low-income backgrounds will need financial help both at further education college and at university through special bursary schemes will strike a chord with English universities and students. For an \"education, education, education\" government, that could be embarrassing. One of the most significant features of the report is that, although media coverage has centred on university fees, half the discussion and recommendations are about further education colleges - the vital step on the ladder to increased participation. But will Cubie's proposals fare any better in the political arena than Lord Dearing's voluminous report on higher education? Ministers in Scotland are sceptical that Cubie's proposals could be delivered for the £62m extra he claims, rising in subsequent years to pounds 71m, and universities are anxious they could simply lose the fee income without gaining anything in return. On the other hand, Tories have condemned the proposals as simply converting tuition fees into a tuition tax and some LibDems regard the graduate payments as deferred fees. The deal, therefore, is by no means done. But, as a senior Scottish Liberal Democrat backbencher put it: \"Fees are dead - or else the coalition is dead.\" The report of the independent commitee of inquiry into student finance is available on www.studentfinance.org.uk.

Duh. Done that. Or at least some of Blair's boys did a couple of years ago in an attempt to spin doctor this sceptr'd isle into something hip, hop and happening. It didn't exactly work. A recent survey of the way Britain is perceived after two years of feverish rebranding shows that Johnny and Janet Foreigner still think of the United Kingdom as being old fashioned, grubby and interestingly cranky. All those heaving bars and cafes lining the streets of fashionable city centres designed by standard-issue, goatee-sporting young architects can't dent an internationally recognised aesthetic rooted in hundreds of years of class distinction, pigeon-fancying, warm beer and supermarket food. These things - as British as mom's apple pie is American - are held together symbolically by one of the greatest graphic designs of all time, the Union Jack (more properly the Union flag). At the start of the 21st century what does the Union Jack represent? Indeed, in an era of devolution and internationalism, does the flag that earned its nickname because a 'jack-crosstree' was naval jargon for a flag flown from the bowsprit of a ship have any tangible meaning at all. If it does, are we the people happy with that meaning? For some, an older generation, it symbolises a time of greater certainty, when Britain had an empire, the king was on his throne and a pound was worth a pound. To classic cars buffs it means great green vintage Bentleys racing the Blue Train from Paris to Marseilles in the 1920s (one did just that, and won). To old soldiers on Remembrance Sunday, it calls to mind their comrades who died in two world wars so we could eat burgers and sniff glue, or just live in peace. But if its history is the Union Jack's strength, it is also its weakness. For sections of the British public it represents outdated political and social beliefs: it can be read as the standard under which Ireland was annexed and subdued with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It can be seen as the banner of an empire that made white people feel superior to black people. It has been worn as a badge of fascism, nationalism and hooliganism, a gesture of aggression, narrow-mindedness and brutality. The issues are no longer clear. The flag - and with it the very notion of Britain and what being British means - is losing the mythologised identity that has held it together. Perhaps many of us have never been particularly happy with the idea of Britishness. The Welsh, Scots and Irish are clearly very different people from the mainstream English. Even then, this is a difficult thing to talk about with anything like clarity. While the evident majority of Irish, Scots and Welsh are Celtic in terms of ethnic roots, the English are an extraordinary melange. True, you will find villages in East Anglia where the people seem to be the very embodiment of Anglo-Saxons, I mean Danes, or is it Vikings, or were Danes in fact Vikings anyway. Scratch an Englishman and you will find a mongrel. I think of myself as English, but my blood is a mix of Anglo-Saxon, Irish Celt and Celtic Spaniard, more or less. It's not just immigrants of the post-war years whose races are mixed, roots uncertain and nationality a matter of myth as much as geography. The Union Jack, however, is first and foremost a symbol of political unity. It emerged, step by step, cross by cross, from the union of Scotland and England in 1606 when James IV of Scotland became James I of England. The new flag displayed the cross of St George of England (red on white) superimposed on the cross of St Andrew of Scotland (white on blue), or vice versa. Oliver Cromwell added an Irish harp to the flag when he subdued Ireland, but this was removed by Charles II at the time of the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The act of union in the reign of Queen Anne in 1707 brought Scotland, England and Wales together as the United Kingdom; Ireland joined the gang in 1801 and the Union Jack as we know it was given its definitive and highly distinctive look. The Irish cross, nominally of St Patrick, but in fact that of the Geraldines, a powerful Irish family, was added into the already complex criss-crossing of St George and St Andrew. The result was far from the mess it might have been: it was a masterpiece. Today, though, the English (whoever they are) want their cross of St George, the Scots their cross of St Andrew, the Irish (careful what you say here . . .) their cross of St Patrick and the Welsh, the red dragon you can't see - presumably, for all those red, blue and white crosses and because Wales has been dominated by England since the death of Owen Glendower in battle in 1416. Whether much will change with a Millbank stooge as leader of the new Welsh Assembly when it gathers in its smart new Richard Rogers-designed building is hard to say. Devolution contains within it the possible final lowering of the Union Jack. But it is more likely that there will long be occasions when the English, Welsh, Scots and Irish will wish to work and play under the same banner. And as for Remembrance Sunday, that will be held under the banner of the Union Jack for as long as it endures, because those hundreds of thousands of people who lived and died so that we could wear Union Jack underpants did so together, and not as Micks, Jocks, Taffys and their English comrades (no collective nickname, note, for the lads representing the dominant culture of these islands). They fought, wittingly or unwittingly, for a set of powerful collective beliefs against the forged creed of Nazism represented by a flag - black swastika in white circle on blood-red backdrop - that was as simple as the Union Jack was complex. Liberty implies complexity: Nazism, the reduction of human life to simplistic certainties. The flag has other saviours: design and fashion. What would designers do without the Union Jack? It gave Mods their look in the early 60s. The Who wore Union Jack clothes long before the Spice Girls. It seemed to be made for the imagery of the pop era, and was used promiscuously by painters, designers and costumiers in the 'I'm backing Britain' days of Harold Wilson's second Labour government (Old Labour, but great modernisers) of 1966-70. And it had been used to style the interiors of fashionable society houses even before the second world war. In his satirical poem Interior Decorator, John Betjeman has his camp narrator say: 'I put Red Ensigns on the seats/And hung Blue Peters down their backs/And on the beds, instead of sheets/Enormous pairs of Union Jacks.' The Union Jack may well be slightly threadbare politically and in terms of devolved national sentiment, but it remains, in design terms at least, one of the most potent icons of all. \u0095 See the designs \u0095 Design your own and win a Guardian Yearbook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2000/jan/06/dance.jazz","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-06T00:00:00Z","webTitle":"Sugared dumb fairy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/jan/06/dance.jazz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2000/jan/06/dance.jazz","fields":{"headline":"Sugared dumb fairy","bodyText":"English National Ballet has been advertising treats from its cast list all through its London run of Nutcrackers, including guest star Mihn Pham from Toulouse and Agnès Letestu and Jose Martinez from Paris Opera. For this we should be grateful. Paris may be only a train ride away, but its ballet company hasn't performed here in 15 years, and any glimpse of its renowned stable of dancers is always worthwhile. Letestu (dancing the Sugar Plum Fairy on Tuesday night) is certainly a showcase for Parisian training. She shapes her phrases with pretty elegance and the delicacy of her legs and feet belie their confident strength. But on this brief appearance she seems a disappointingly calculating artist, taking few risks and fewer apparent pleasures in her own dancing. The qualities of her style look superficial and fussy rather than evidence of personality or interpretation. Her partner, Jose Martinez, is likewise tall and finely made, with the peculiarly refined precision that is prized in French men. Yet he seems curiously young and underpowered, as if his talents are waiting to be realised. It is unfair, however, to make more than provisional judgment, for the shock of returning to Derek Deane's Nutcracker is the reminder of how sidelined its \"star\" performers are. This production is dominated by a slick, exhibitionist Drosselmeyer (Deane's own role) whose fancy tricks and creepily manipulative influence on Clara leave no room for the benevolence of the Sugar Plum Fairy. When Clara is whisked away to the Kingdom of Sweets, the Fairy is not permitted to greet her or listen to her story. All she gets to do is perform the grand pas de deux with her Prince, that dance becoming one among many impersonal numbers. The erosion of the Fairy's role is symptomatic of Deane's heartless treatment of the whole plot. The Nutcracker's story may be trivial, but its roots lie deep in fairy tale morality. When the story is effectively abandoned and the ballet reduced to tricks and divertissements, it leaves not only little for audiences to respond to, but little for dancers to make sense of.

Nobel prize winner Heaney's translation of the epic Beowulf has been named the winner of this year's Whitbread Poetry Award, beating Hughes's Alcestis. The accolade now puts Heaney in the shortlist for the overall title alongside three other individual category winners announced today - Rose Tremain, Tim Lott and David Cairns. Heaney's reworking of the Anglo-Saxon classic was dedicated to Hughes, who died in 1998. The pair had worked together in the past to co-edit two anthologies. They have dominated the previous three Book Of The Year titles. Hughes won in 1999 with Birthday Letters and 1998 with Tales From Ovid, while Heaney won the year before that with The Spirit Level. Tremain, whose absence from the Booker Prize shortlist last year raised eyebrows, took the Whitbread Novel Award for her book Music And Silence, beating 104 other entries. The First Novel Award went to Lott's White City Blue - a look at end-of-the-Millennium laddishness. Cairns' book Berlioz Volume II: Servitude And Greatness, his work on the great 19th-century composer, took the Biography Award. There will be a fifth entrant for the overall title when the winner of the Whitbread Children's Book Of The Year prize is awarded later this month. Each of today's successful authors wins £2,000, with the chance of a further £21,000 for the eventual winner of the main prize. The Book Of The Year winner will be chosen by a panel of nine judges - including model Jerry Hall and chaired by Dr Eric Anderson - and announced on January 25 at a dinner in Whitbread's London headquarters. The children's prize will be awarded the same night. The Whitbread awards are now in their 29th year, although the Book Of The Year category was not introduced until 1985. Tremain could chalk up a family first if she takes the Book Of The Year title later this month; her partner, the biographer Richard Holmes, won the 1986 Whitbread Book Of The Year. The winners were as follows: Whitbread Poetry Award Beowulf, by Seamus Heaney (Faber &amp; Faber, £14.99) Heaney's reworking of the Anglo-Saxon poem tells of the eponymous mighty warrior who comes to the aid of a Danish king, Hrothgar. He defeats two monsters to rule a kingdom before finally facing a dragon which terrorises the country. Heaney, who lives in Dublin, went to Queen's University, Belfast, where as an undergraduate he studied Beowulf. His first book, Death of a Naturalist, appeared in 1966, and he has since published poetry, criticism and translations. He was first commissioned to translate Beowulf in the mid-80s but put the project on hold. Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995. The Whitbread judges said: \"In a year notable for many strong works, including three brilliant translations, Heaney's recovery of Beowulf for a contemporary readership stands out. He brings an extraordinary sensitivity and breadth of language to this Anglo-Saxon warrior epic. In a translation that brilliantly combines the faithful with the original, Seamus Heaney has reclaimed the first classic of the English language for a contemporary readership.\" Whitbread Novel Award Music and Silence, by Rose Tremain (Chatto &amp; Windus, £16.99) Set in 1629, it revolves around Englishman Peter Claire, who arrives at the palace of the Danish King Christian IV to join his court orchestra, and the complicated friendships and love affairs which develop. The king seeks harmony and order through the music created by his orchestra whilst Kirsten, his adulterous wife, detests music and craves silence. Music and Silence is the eighth novel by Rose Tremain, who lives in Norwich, Norfolk. A best-selling author in Britain, America and France, her work has been translated into 14 languages. Tremain's Booker Prize-nominated Restoration was made into a film starring Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Sir Ian McKellen. The Whitbread judges said: \"All the books had strengths but this stood above the others. She writes about both men and women with huge imaginative sympathy - all the characters are lit from the inside.\" Whitbread First Novel Award White City Blue, by Tim Lott (Viking, £9.99) A tragi-comic novel about male friendships, narrated by Frank, an estate agent in Shepherd's Bush. In a series of flashbacks he describes how his group of mates became friends and how they developed through their adult lives with a shared passion for QPR football club and a series of mad escapades. Tim Lott, who lives in Notting Hill, west London, has been a television producer, editor of the listings magazine, City Limits, and a rock journalist. In 1996 he wrote the award-winning memoir, The Scent of Dried Roses, an exploration of his own depression and his mother's suicide. He is currently working on the screenplay of White City Blue and writing his second novel. The Whitbread judges said: \"We all passionately agreed on the winner. Heartbreaking about the reality of growing up, and a novel that we all felt that we wanted to carry on reading. \"An intense and revealing look at male friendships. Technically assured and funny.\" Whitbread Biography Award Berlioz, Volume II: Servitude And Greatness, by David Cairns (Allen Lane The Penguin Press, £25) Hector Berlioz was one of the great composers of the nineteenth century and one of the most significant conductors of his day. A friend of Liszt and Wagner, he was feted in Germany and Russia but rejected by his native Paris and struggled for money most of his life, relying on journalism to make a living. His struggles for artistic recognition and financial security form two of the book's themes. David Cairns, who lives in Putney, south London, has worked as music critic at The Sunday Times and arts editor at the Spectator. He has also had an academic career at the Getty Centre in Santa Monica; Merton College, Oxford; and the University of California, where he is a visiting professor. The Whitbread judges said: \"The judges had a long and agonised debate between Hilary Spurling's Matisse and David Cairn's Berlioz. Both captured the eras in which their subjects lived and worked, as well as elegantly relating the technicalities of their respective crafts. \"David Cairns' Berlioz wins this year's Whitbread Biography Award for his masterly evocation of the inner man as well the outer world in which he lived and worked. \"The judges felt that this biography is a work of art in itself which will still be enjoyed and admired in centuries to come.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2000/jan/07/comment","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-07T11:14:20Z","webTitle":"The best hospital scene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/07/comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jan/07/comment","fields":{"headline":"The best hospital scene","bodyText":"New York, Our Lady of Misery Medical Center.

Kalejs, 86, made a pre-dawn escape from the Leicestershire residential home where he had been staying. He left Britain voluntarily after the home secretary issued a notice that he intended to deport him. Kalejs was accompanied to Heathrow by police and immigration officials. Just after 10.30am he left British soil en route to Australia aboard a Singapore airlines jet. It is believed he will be greeted by protests in Melbourne today, which will renew pressure on the Australian government to prosecute him. Latvia stressed last night that it was investigating him. Nazi-hunters wanted Kalejs, an Australian citizen, charged in Britain for involvement in the murder of 30,000 people, mainly Jews, while joint second in command of a Latvian mobile killing squad, the Arajs Kommando, that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers of Latvia during the second world war. In London, the home secretary intensified his offensive against critics of Britain's decision that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Kalejs which let him leave the country as a free man. The US and Canada had both considered the evidence of Kalejs's involvement in war crimes strong enough to deport him. Mr Straw admitted that \"with hindsight\" Kalejs should have been on the suspects' index, which would have led to him being denied entry into Britain. His name has now been added to the list of 500,000 to be refused entry. The home secretary also hinted that even if there had been strong evidence, the war crimes act may not have covered Kalejs. He said Scotland Yard \"considered it legally questionable whether Kalejs could be regarded as resident in the United Kingdom as would be required if he were to be tried under the war crimes act 1991\". He stressed that his decision that Kalejs should be deported required a lower standard of proof than a criminal prosecution: \"My decision that reasonable grounds existed to believe that Kalejs was complicit in war crimes was, of course, reached where necessary on the balance of probabilities.\" Mr Straw said nothing more could have been done, but sidestepped questions about the rigour of the police investigation into Kalejs, who was never questioned by officers about any of the war crimes allegations against him. Kalejs entered Britain at Birmingham airport on September 27 1997, from Frankfurt and as an Australian national had permission to stay for six months. He had a passport which had been renewed in February 1999 which did not contain stamps which could have alerted immigration officers to the fact that he had been deported from the US in 1994 and Canada in 1997. Britain's refusal to prosecute Kalejs was condemned by one of his alleged victims Alfred Winter, 81, who lives in the US. Mr Winter told the Guardian he was guarded by Kalejs's unit at the Salaspils camp where he was held from December 1941 to July 1942 and saw executions, beatings and death from starvation: \"It's a very bad feeling that he has escaped justice again.\" Lord Janner, who campaigns for war criminals to be brought to justice, said: \"I am deeply disappointed, frustrated and sad that this evil man was allowed to leave Britain before he was sent to jail for the rest of his days. It is now up to the Australian authorities. We are going to try to get them to investigate fully.\" Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe expressed dismay that Kalejs had departed without facing criminal action in the UK. In Australia, ministers have also promised to reinvestigate Kalejs if new evidence comes to light, having dropped a prosecution for lack of evidence. The Latvian government said yesterday that criminal proceedings had been started against Kalejs in that country and called for international help gathering information which might provide evidence against him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2000/jan/08/sport.worldclubchampionship","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-08T22:06:23Z","webTitle":"A test of faith for armchair fans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/08/sport.worldclubchampionship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/08/sport.worldclubchampionship","fields":{"headline":"A test of faith for armchair fans","bodyText":"In case anyone has forgotten, the fourth round of the FA Cup is being played this weekend. Today Burnley, Fulham and Tranmere take on Coventry, Wimbledon and Sunderland in the hope of springing some of the season's major surprises. Tomorrow Manchester City hope to revive distant glories by knocking out Leeds. For the nation at large, however, there is only one match of the day today and this will be taking place in a faraway competition of which, until the night before last, most people knew little and cared less. The Fifa World Club Championship may be a spurious tournament since half the teams taking part are not the champions of the continents they represent. And South Melbourne may, in the words of Tommy Docherty, be no greater a power in global football than Stalybridge Celtic. Yet the reality is that a sizeable proportion of the country's television viewers will turn on BBC1 this evening eager to find out what happens in the next instalment of Manchester United - The Movie. By getting himself sent off on Thursday for planting a set of studs into the right thigh of Necaxa's Jose Milian, David Beckham has managed to kick-start domestic interest in this dubious exercise. United's encounter with Vasco da Gama will occupy the Casualty slot which, given the present physical excesses of Brazilian club football, may prove painfully appropriate. Perhaps it is just as well that Beckham will not be playing. As it is, when United resume their domestic programme he is now guaranteed an even rougher reception on opponents' grounds in the Premiership than he suffered after his dismissal when playing for England against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. This time his petulant streak got the better of him when his team were a goal down rather than drawing 2-2. Before the Necaxa game Beckham only faced the minor embarrassment of having his pop star wife admit on television that he sometimes wore her G-strings. It is unlikely that his tormentors will be satisfied with a couple of verses of Thongs Ain't What They Used To Be. Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that the reaction of the Necaxa players had led to Beckham's dismissal barely stood up to examination since Horacio Elizondo, the Argentine referee, was seen reaching for his breast pocket the moment the boot went in. Yet in the immediate aftermath of games, most managers will stand up for their players. When Manchester United, having won the European Cup for the first time, met Estudiantes of Argentina in Buenos Aires in the 1968 World Club Championship Nobby Stiles was sent off for nothing more than an impatient gesture towards a linesman. Stiles's protest that he had merely claimed a foul for a head-butt was supported by Matt Busby, who said: \"I object to Stiles's sending-off because it was based on his false reputation of being a tough player.\" Really? Even more bizarre has been the confidence expressed by David Davies, the Football Association's executive director, that Manchester United will eventually leave the Brazilian public with a favourable impression. For this to happen United will, in the space of a week or less, have to acquire the bridge-building techniques of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In the matter of Latin-American public relations the club appear to have made errors similar to those of England during the 1970 World Cup, when Sir Alf Ramsey's dour reaction to media attention managed to unite Mexico, the host country, against his team. In Brazil footballers are public property and reporters expect and receive instant interviews, sometimes during matches, and Ferguson's insistence on closed training sessions has clearly not gone down well. It is difficult, moreover, to imagine Busby rounding on an English journalist at the end of a press conference abroad and accusing him of printing lies. Spats between Ferguson and reporters are hardly new but this was not the time or the place for the Red Knight to switch to his Queen of Hearts mode. This is a profound pity, because the way Manchester United's 10 men rallied against Necaxa in the second half to force a 1-1 draw through Dwight Yorke's late goal reconfirmed the strength of character and refusal to admit defeat which in May had enabled them to beat Bayern Munich in stoppage time at the Nou Camp to become European champions. There is so much more in Manchester United to admire than condemn, as Thursday's second half at the Maracana proved. And if they beat Vasco da Gama this evening, memories of a week devoted to hassles about sex, lies and video evidence will swiftly recede. Ferguson's side, however, had to raise the tempo against Necaxa in order to save the game while a man short, and this in Rio's heat and humidity. The slow-slow-quick-quick-slow style which the conditions demand is alien to them and the long grass of the Maracana, which suits the Brazilian desire to hold the ball up, does not help their passing game. It will be asking a lot, therefore, to expect a United win only 48 hours after an exhausting opening game and when they are without Beckham and Paul Scholes. Just so long as nobody else puts his foot in it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk/2000/jan/09/northernireland.theobserver1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-09T00:35:10Z","webTitle":"Welcome back to the craic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/09/northernireland.theobserver1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/09/northernireland.theobserver1","fields":{"headline":"Welcome back to the craic","bodyText":"A is for Assembly After decades of resistance to rule from Stormont on the one side and power-sharing on the other, we now have a Stormont Assembly with a power-sharing executive.

Mr Straw insisted he was not denigrating the English and said he wished they would celebrate their national character and their achievements as a nation. But he stuck to the distinction he had made yesterday between English nationalism and that of Scotland, Welsh and Irish. \"We want to celebrate our achievements in England as well as in the United Kingdom, but in order to do that we have to have an understanding about why the English people's sense of nationalism is a somewhat distorted one from that of the Scots, Welsh and Irish,\" said Mr Straw, alluding to England's dominance of the UK. Mr Straw's return to the debate on Englishness followed the furore he triggered with his remarks on a Radio 4 programme on English identity. Rightwing commentators such as Simon Heffer of the Mail accused Mr Straw of confusing English nationalism with soccer hooliganism. Others were quick to criticise Mr Straw focusing on the dark side of English nationalism. Today, Mr Straw said he wished the English would celebrate their national character and their achievements as a nation. \"I am English and I am also from Essex, and I want to see a rounded sense of Englishness and for us to celebrate that much more,\" Mr Straw said. \"I wasn't saying that the English exclusively had a propensity to violence. What I was seeking to do was to explain why it feels different to be Scots or Welsh or Irish from being English. Part of that explanation is over the centuries the English have been very, very dominant.\" The debate on what it means to be English comes amid concern that Labour's devolution project with the creation of separate assemblies in Scotland and Wales will lead to a splintering of the UK. Some Conservative politicians already have expressed their unhappiness with the new constitutional arrangements. English MPs are unable to influence policy in Wales and Scotland on a whole range of matters, including high spending areas that are subsidised by the English taxpayer. Yet Scottish and Welsh MPs can vote on issues that affect the English. France already has tried to exploit the differences between the regions. In the recent row over British beef, prime minister Lionel Jospin offered to exempt Scottish beef from the French ban, a proposal rejected by prime minister Tony Blair. But Scotland criticised Mr Blair's decision as harmful to its interests. Mr Straw insisted that the emergence of greater national pride in the various parts of the UK as a result of devolution did not threaten unity. \"It is my own very strong belief, and always has been, that devolution is part of the way in which we understand the need for self-expression by Scotland and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland,\" he said today. \"By doing so we bind the UK and make it much richer, rather than undermining it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jan/12/pinochet.chile4","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-12T01:32:54Z","webTitle":"Statement that signals freedom for general","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/12/pinochet.chile4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/12/pinochet.chile4","fields":{"headline":"Statement that signals freedom for general","bodyText":"Key extracts from yesterday's home office statement: \"The Secretary of State has over past months received a number of representations concerning Senator Pinochet's state of health.

Senator Pinochet was arrested in London on 16 October 1998, pursuant to a warrant issued by the 5th central magistrates' court in Madrid. He has been held since that date on bail. 2. Following the second judgment of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords in March 1999, on 14 April 1999 I issued a second Authority to Proceed in respect of offences of torture and conspiracy to torture alleged to have been committed by Senator Pinochet after December 1988. 3. On 16 May 1999 Senator Pinochet's solicitors applied for permission for a judicial review of that decision by me. The state of Senator Pinochet's health was not among the grounds advanced by his legal representatives. At the hearing on 27 May last year the application for permission for judicial review against me was dismissed. The extradition hearing took place between 27 and 30 September 1999 at the Bow Street Magistrate's Court. On 8 October 1999 the Bow Street magistrate committed Senator Pinochet on all charges to await my decision on surrender. 4. Reports about Senator Pinochet's medical condition were taken into account by me in taking both of my decisions on the ATPs but at those stages I had no reason to doubt his fitness to stand trial. Since the ATP stage, Senator Pinochet has not made direct representations to me about his medical condition. 5. However, on 14 October 1999, representations were however submitted by the Chilean Embassy, attaching recent medical reports on Senator Pinochet. They suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in his medical condition. 6. I have a clear legal duty to operate the Extradition Act in full and in the light of the information from the Chilean embassy that duty involved informing myself of the true facts about his health. 7. I therefore asked Senator Pinochet to undergo a thorough and extensive medical examination, to be undertaken by an independent team of clinicians. Senator Pinochet gave his consent. He was entitled to the usual patient confidentiality and he has chosen to exercise that right. He did agree to disclosure of the report to me and to the UK prosecuting authorities. 8. On the advice of this Government's Chief medical officer, I appointed a team of clinicians of outstanding national and international reputation. They were: • Sir John Grimley Evans, Professor of Clinical Geratology of the University of Oxford; • Dr Michael Denham, Consultant Physician in Geriatric Medicine Northwick Park Hospital; • Andrew Lees, Professor of Neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London; and • Maria Wyke, a Consultant Neuropsychologist. 9. It was established that they had no inappropriate personal interest in the case. The examination took place on 5 January 2000. 10. My officials received the team's report late on January 6 and I considered it with advice over last weekend. 11. The unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the three medical practitioners and the consultant neuropsychologist was that, following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected. 12. I have therefore told Senator Pinochet's legal representatives that, subject to any representations I may receive, I am minded to take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings. 13. I have written formally to the Crown Prosecution Service as representatives of the Kingdom of Spain, and the Government of Chile, as well as to France, Belgium and Switzerland who have outstanding extradition requests. Letters have also gone to a number of human rights organisations inviting them to submit any further representations which they consider I should take into account within the next 7 days. Madam Speaker, 14. Throughout these proceedings, I have not been able to make any oral statement to the House because of my quasi-judicial role in respect of extradition matters and because of the sub judice rules of this House. I have always made clear that I would make a full oral statement when the matter has finally been resolved, which of course I shall do. Meanwhile, I have to maintain an open mind on this matter and I hope the House will understand that until the matter is finally concluded, what I can say is bound heavily to be circumscribed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/jan/13/emu.theeuro","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-13T03:38:55Z","webTitle":"Gaps in the market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/13/emu.theeuro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/13/emu.theeuro","fields":{"headline":"Gaps in the market","bodyText":"House prices are rising, tills jangling and shares riding high. If, as expected, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee decides to raise interest rates today it has plenty of reasons. The bank sets interest rates at the level it deems necessary for achieving the government's 2.5% inflation target, taking into account the state of the domestic economy and global conditions. Nothing else matters, least of all that borrowing costs are currently 5.5% in Britain and 3% in the single-currency zone. But there could soon be an added dimension to economic policy. Some ministers, including foreign secretary Robin Cook and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers, say it is time the government ended speculation and agreed to hold a referendum on monetary union soon after the next election. Yet the five economic tests for entry laid down by Gordon Brown in October 1997 stipulate that the United Kingdom economy should have converged with those in the euro zone before entry and that failure to do so could have serious consequences for Britain. \"In joining economic and monetary union (Emu), interest rates in the UK would no longer be set in response to domestic economic conditions,\" the treasury said at the time. \"Rather, the European central bank (ECB) would set rates to achieve price stability in the Emu area as a whole. If economic conditions in the UK were similar then the ECB's policy would be appropriate. But if conditions were very different rates could often be too high or too low for the UK. So it is important that the UK cycle is broadly in line when we join Emu and that this convergence is sustainable.\" Ideally, what the government would like is for growth rates in UK and the single-currency zone to be broadly in line in the summer of 2001 and for the interest-rate gap to have narrowed significantly. The problem is that there is no guarantee that economic convergence will be any closer early in the next parliament - when a referendum on joining has been mooted - than it was in the autumn of 1997. After eight years of growth, the UK economy is currently much further advanced in the economic cycle than the rest of Europe, which is still in the early stages of recovery from a pronounced slowdown at the end of the 90s. Since 1992, Britain has been the second fastest growing economy in the G7 after the United States and its jobless level is around half that of the three biggest economies in euroland - Germany, France and Italy. Interest and exchange rates have reflected the disparity in economic performance. The gap may now widen. Increases are in prospect this year, taking base rates to 6.5% or even 7% by early 2001. Rates in the single currency zone are also likely to rise, but only to around 3.5%. Joining Emu would eliminate this gap overnight. Interest rates would fall to euroland's levels: an attractive prospect on the face of it. The difficulty, however, is that halving UK borrowing costs could unleash a consumer spending spree to dwarf the Lawson boom of the late 80s. Mortgage demand would soar, driving up prices in an already overheated property market, and consumer demand would far outstrip the capacity of the domestic economy to supply goods and services. Unfortunately the government would be bereft of policy options. It might grin and bear it, hoping any shocks caused by Emu entry would be transitory. This would be a high-risk strategy given that the short-term political advantages of a booming economy would be outweighed by the costs of trying to bring inflation back under control and coping with the loss of competitiveness for UK firms. Without the traditional option of devaluation, the hangover could be very long indeed. A second choice would be to use a more active fiscal policy. Reducing interest rates by three points is equivalent to pumping an extra £30bn a year into the economy: to mop up excess spending the government would either have to cut public spending or raise taxes (£30bn is the equivalent of more than 10p on the basic rate of income tax). UK home buyers have more short-term variable mortgages than borrowers in the rest of Europe. Fixed-rate mortgages have grown in recent years and that has helped convergence because these are based on long-term interest rates, which are almost identical in the UK and continental Europe. But more than half new mortgages are still based on short-term rates. Oxford's John Muellbauer says the government could have hastened the switch to fixed-rate mortgages by preserving mortgage interest relief for them; it could also choke off borrowing by setting tighter limits on the size of home loans in relation to property values. Other options would be to impose capital gains tax on the sale of homes, something most of Europe already does, or introduce a tougher system of local property taxes, set according to market values and uprated annually. None of this would be popular. Imagine the tabloid headlines that would greet a move by the government to slap capital gains tax on houses in order to get into monetary union more quickly. Ministers certainly do, which is why some of them, including the chancellor, are in no hurry to take the single currency plunge just yet.

Confirming national stereotypes, the research found that British new-technology based firms are much more buccaneering than their risk-averse German counterparts. They are more international in their outlook, selling into a wider range of foreign markets, and also have the edge when it comes to marketing. German hi-tech firms tend to be more parochial, concentrating on the home market and Europe. They are often closely integrated to the supply chains of big international German businesses and more likely to sell customised products. British firms are promiscuous, preferring to make \"off the peg\" products which they sell to a broader range of customers with whom they have a casual relationship. The research, by academics from the London Business School and Germany's Centre for European Economic Research, found that the relative weaknesses of British hi-tech firms are familiar to students of British industry - poor skill levels and insufficient investment in research and development. The German firms are predictably strong in both departments, with a broader base of skills compensating for a less flexible labour market.

And there are those who see it as something altogether more subtle, a tale of deal-making and negotiation, cogs and wheels, a human account of personality and circumstance. Conservatives, until Mrs Thatcher mutinied, were traditionally pragmatists captured only occasionally by principle, sea-anchors on the pirate ship of progress. \"Programme?\" as Churchill once said, \"of course we have a programme. It is a sound belief in the British Constitution.\" For most of her reign, Mrs Thatcher's personal sea-anchor was a self-made businessman with a misleadingly modest demeanour. Often obscured by the larger and grander Willie Whitelaw, John (now Lord) Wakeham was her chief whip and later, in a succession of Trollopian-sounding sinecures, lord privy seal and lord president of the council - jobs which left him free to be what amounted to Mrs T's man of business. He squared the party at Westminster, or tricky cabinet ministers, or conflicting policy ambitions, and occasionally warned her that it couldn't be done. Wakeham became a kind of prêt-à-porter version of Whitelaw. \"My ambition was to make the country run better. I am a facilitator, I make things work. I can take a programme of legislation, with everyone wanting something different, and I can end up delivering something everyone can live with.\" But he had been out of government for the best part of five years and, as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, lost to public view, when Tony Blair recruited him to sort out his growing political difficulties over the future of the Lords. He needed someone to chair the royal commission on reform, someone trusted by all sides who wouldn't push an agenda of their own, someone who would deliver a solution that would work. Reform of the Lords is the last hole in his jigsaw of constitutional reform: Wakeham's job is to make a piece that fits. Next Thursday the report is published and Wakeham will reveal - with no advance notice to Blair, he insists - whether he has pulled it off. \"The test of success,\" says Wakeham, \"will be that people will say, 'well, a bit disappointing, not quite what I wanted, but we can live with it' ... because if it was wonderful for somebody it would be unacceptable to someone else.\" What to some politicians would be a disastrous lack of conviction and fighting instinct, is to Wakeham the supreme virtue. Where others dream of redesigning the economic or social landscape, his dream is simply an engineer's desire to make things work. Trust is the lubricant of the Wakeham machine. \"I don't think there are too many people who can move into one set of politicians or another set of politicians and be trusted enough to do deals with them. People trust me. They know I'll play straight and try to find a solution.\" Tony Blair is not trusting Wakeham on his reputation alone. Less than two years ago, Blair's lord chancellor and his home secretary were at loggerheads over the impact of incorporating the European convention on human rights on press freedom. Lord Irvine argued it would have no effect. Jack Straw was a lot less confident and so was Wakeham. Then, as the legislation went through parliament, Irvine did a U-turn which enabled Jack Straw to change the bill in a way which the Press Complaints Commission is now confident will protect self-regulation. Wakeham is credited with being the key intermediary. He has prospered by cutting deals and troubleshooting for most of his adult life, a skill acquired, his more snobbish critics claim, from his garage-owning father, Walter. But John Wakeham might have been a farmer (he now owns a farm in south west Wales), and a perfect day for him is to get up with the dawn, get the papers from the shop in the Hampshire village where he lives, go down to the Solent and motor his old fishing boat to Osborne Bay where he anchors, reads the papers and makes calls on his mobile. \"I can talk to the people I need to. No one can reach me.\" This is the independence his father, a powerful presence in his son's mind even 30 years after his death, told him to strive for. \"There was only one sort of materialistic ambition my father gave me, and that wasn't to be rich, it was to be independent. He thought you should do things in life which gave you as much freedom to move as possible. That's why I became an accountant. I was never quite sure whether he was a Conservative, but he used to say, 'you've got to give the elected government of the day the benefit of the doubt, until they've been proved wrong'. He was methodical, level-headed, he didn't get too excited. I'm quite methodical, and I don't get too excited.\" Years later, lamenting the damage to political life caused by the antipathy between Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock, a friend remembers John shaking his head sadly, as he said: \"The trouble is they're different ages, different ideologies, different life experiences. Their lives scarcely touch at any point.\" At heart, Wakeham probably believes the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, whoever they are, are united by more than divides them, and that like Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson they should, after a particularly bruising encounter at the despatch box, meet privately for a drink and a bit of mutual backslapping. John Wakeham was born in 1932, the first of three children. His father came back from the war to the family garage in what was then the small market town of Godalming in Surrey, just in time to scrape together the money to send John off to Charterhouse, the nearby public school. Major Wakeham had firm views about education. He believed that 10 years of it was quite enough. That ruled out university. But, through what he regards as his father's sacrifices in sending him to public school, the young John slipped quietly through the conventional life pattern of the professional middle classes, leaving scarcely a ripple: Charterhouse School, the City, Westminster and the Carlton Club. Eric Harrison, a master who taught him chemistry and became a friend, remembers him as \"very receptive, very pleasant to deal with\". Hardly the stuff of greatness. \"No, I wouldn't have predicted great things from him. But it's often the ones who don't stand out at school who go on and do well.\" Wakeham seems to have turned a tendency to anonymity into an asset. No need to airbrush him out of recent history as the Tories struggle to reinvent themselves. No one remembers he was there in the first place. His name is in the indexes of all those fat political memoirs of Mrs Thatcher's ministers but it's hard to find him in the narrative. \"Subtle\" and \"wily\" are the two adjectives most often attached to his name. Yet he was at the top table for many of the major events from the moment he became chief whip in 1983 until he failed to fix it for Thatcher in 1990, not as some Machiavellian string-puller, but as the team mechanic, the man with the oily rag who knew how to make things work. It's said that he endeared himself to Thatcher because he'd passed his accountancy exams - qualifications her son Mark had failed to notch up. It seems more plausible that it was his subsequent business success that marked him out in his prime minister's eyes. He turned his accountancy training into a highly profitable flair for company doctoring, which had made him his first million before he was out of his twenties. Less than 10 years later, as well as a thriving accountancy practice, he had a controlling interests in half a dozen companies. By the time he married his first wife Roberta (they had met at an English Speaking Union party in 1962) and prepared to go into politics, he had 1,000 people working for him. But Tory selection committees are notoriously sceptical of success. Or perhaps it was a lack of ideological zeal, showing through even then. (He is proud to boast that he is one of only three non-voting members of the Fabian society. The others are Sir Geoffrey Howe and John Maynard Keynes. \"I didn't support Labour, I joined because I was interested in politics.\") It took him nearly 10 years to find and win a safe seat: he was finally elected, for Maldon in Essex, in 1974, distinguished from the other new entrants, it's said, only by having his own driver and car phone. \"If you look at the 100 or so of that intake, there were obvious people like Leon Brittan and Nigel Lawson who were going to make it. But me? Not many would have forecast it.\" Not that he went into politics, he claims unconvincingly, to get on. \"I felt I owed it to my father to have wider ambitions than just being an accountant. I felt I had to justify myself.\" Political history is littered with the failed careers of people who, having been stars in their own world, sweep into politics to make a similar success only to lose their way in the arcane, contrary labyrinth of Westminster. Wakeham set out to learn. As soon as he had sorted out his business interests and made himself available for promotion, he was recruited into the whips' office. It didn't take him long to realise that his skills, honed in business, could be applied as usefully to the backstairs of Westminster politics. \"I was absolutely fascinated by how Westminster actually works, the interplay of all the different forces, the smoke-filled rooms, the nods and the winks. As a businessman, I found it more comprehensible than most politicians do. The driving force in my life is how you make things happen, what are the processes which make things move ahead. \"One thing I learnt as chief whip,\" he goes on, \"was the infinite capacity of human beings to absorb flattery. And that the one thing you have to be is trustworthy. If you sell someone a pup once, you'll never be trusted again.\" Trust is Wakeham's secret weapon. \"You could tell him anything, and I mean anything, and know it would never go any further,\" one old colleague reported. \"And people on all sides of the house knew that. And you know where you stand, you always know what basis you're talking to him on, that he's not operating some secret scheme of his own.\" One ex-whip, Andrew Mitchell, remembers being recruited by Wakeham. \"He was amazing. He said, 'I will tell you everything. Don't let me down'. Can you think of a better way of ensuring someone's loyalty? He's remarkably uncynical about people. If he thinks you're a good egg, he'll forgive you the crassest mistakes. If he doesn't, you're in outer darkness.\" For all of Thatcher's second term, Wakeham was her chief whip, her capo di tutti capi, running the team responsible for keeping the leadership in touch with the troops, soothing egos, balancing interests, trying to make sure everyone who mattered got a little of what they wanted. In particular, he was careful to keep the wets, the refuseniks, on board (and out of the then flourishing SDP). Julian Critchley, one of the government's most devastating backbench critics, says he was formidable. \"He was extremely well briefed,\" he says. \"Once, when Francis Pym, who'd been chief whip himself, told him just as a courtesy that he was going to make a speech at the Oxford Union condemning Thatcher and all her works, Wakeham said, 'oh, I know all about that'. And he had part of Pym's speech in front of him on his desk.\" Part of Wakeham's strength was that he was never \"One of Us\", but he and Thatcher remain close. \"I was not impervious to her weaknesses,\" he says. \"But I think she did a tremendous job at the things she had to do for this country. And I could help her. I got things delivered. I didn't go running to her with problems. She never wanted to trim. Sometimes you had to force her to. I used to give her my best advice, but if it was unpalatable I told it to her before a meeting, so that no one else knew and she could play the meeting how she liked; if she wanted to she could ask what I had thought. We achieved a lot of things that way.\" He also had a huge majority. He exploited it to turn the whips' office into a political nursery, a test bed for talent. He was Thatcher's scout, and he spotted John Major, who wrote of him: \"John Wakeham was subtle, reflective, a persuader, a fixer, fascinated by why something happened rather than simply what had happened... he played Mrs Thatcher like a master fisherman landing a prize salmon.\" In 1984, his life was shattered, and his career stalled, when the IRA killed his wife Roberta and very nearly killed him. After seven hours trapped in the wreckage of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, he was left with such terrible crush injuries to his legs that he nearly lost them. \"I can remember most of it... I was very clear that my responsibility was to bring up my sons, who were nine and 11. If I became bitter about it all there was no way I could make a happy home for them, and I had to force myself not to be bitter. You did your crying at night.\" There is an agonising pause as he is suddenly overwhelmed with memories. \"I've never dreamt about it, thank God. One of the most distressing things was when I talked to a girl who is writing a book about the fire brigade, and she played me an interview with the guy who was in charge that night.\" It is the magnitude of the fire chief's horror at his predicament which he finds devastating to hear. \"'There's another guy in there, Wake-somebody...'\" Wakeham breaks off abruptly. \"No, I can't do this, it's not fair.\" His life was put back together by his secretary, Alison Ward. They married in 1985 and, when they had a son together, she also adopted the two boys from his first marriage. They are now grown up: Jonathan is in advertising, but also writes (opera libretti and film scripts); Ben is an estate agent. Alison had worked for Thatcher and is by all accounts a powerful personality. \"It's said of her that on a bad day she can turn milk to yoghurt at 50 paces,\" her husband announces. A close colleague describes Wakeham as \"very, very private. Too private. I doubt that even his wife really knows him. He keeps his own feelings very quiet.\" The bomb is not a part of his life he can easily bring himself to revisit. He refuses to comment on the Northern Ireland peace process and the early release of the bombers. His tone suggests that if he did, it would not necessarily be in a spirit of forgiveness. But Matthew Parris, a friend, agrees that he has succeeded in escaping bitterness. \"Whereas Norman Tebbit grew angrier, it seems to me John Wakeham has grown more mellow.\" He was back in the whips' office, on two sticks but miraculously walking, more quickly than anyone believed possible. By the 1987 elec tion, after four years as chief whip, he wanted a real role to play, his own powerbase, and preferably his own department to run, although he told friends he knew he couldn't take a job which would be too physically demanding. When Nigel Lawson asked him to be his number two as Treasury Chief Secretary, he said no. \"He obviously hoped for something better\", Lawson recorded in his memoirs. But he had had a patchy 1987 election campaign, and Mrs Thatcher put him into another negotiating role, as Leader of the house. It was only after she needed his job for Sir Geoffrey Howe that he finally became secretary of state for energy. It was ideally suited for a businessman-fixer. The biggest and most complex of the privatisations, electricity, was running into the ground under Cecil Parkinson. Wakeham regards it as his finest hour. Stephen Littlechild, the economist who became the privatised industry's first regulator, agrees. \"Much of the conceptual thinking had been done,\" he recalls, \"but it was not clear that privatisation was actually going to go ahead. Wakeham did it, with charm, and without making enemies. He took each party separately, told them he understood their concerns but had to take account of others too. He won respect from all concerned. He put together a package which gave something to all the main players.\" Matthew Parris agrees. \"It is impossible to overrate him as a fixer. He is a master of never adding insult to injury. I don't see him as a political original, like Willie Whitelaw, but if I wanted somebody to break difficult news, or to persuade someone of something difficult to accept, I would go to John Wakeham.\" Just as the climax of electricity privatisation approached in 1990, the crisis of nerve among Tory MPs over Thatcher's leadership reached its own climax, and Sir Geoffrey Howe sank the assassin's dagger between her shoulderblades. When the disastrous results of the first ballot came through, Thatcher turned to Wakeham, to try to rescue her doomed campaign. But he had been too absorbed in the privatisation to be up to speed with the state of mind of the cabinet, never mind the wider party. Fatally, it was his idea that, since she could not stay without cabinet's support, she should ask her ministers for it, individually. Although only the most committed Thatcherites believe it was an act of disloyalty, it was a terminally serious misjudgment about how to play a desperate situation. As they trooped in one by one to tell her she couldn't win, she was left with no option but to resign. At first it seemed he would prosper under the new regime: as chief whip he had, after all, talent-spotted the new prime minister . Instead his influence waned sharply. In 1992 he went to the Lords. \"Cabinet ministers are like football managers. Everyone's endlessly discussing their prospects. When John Major asked me to be leader of the Lords, I said only for two years. That was my way of making sure my political career didn't end in tears.\" But observers thought he looked uncomfortable in the Lords, that the difficulty of dealing with the unpredictable and undisciplined hereditary peers didn't suit his more mechanistic approach to deal-making. \"Government Fixer Needs New Tool Kit\", one headline writer claimed. \"Past his sell-by date\" they wrote when he went. But Wakeham's reputation is built on the ability to see what's round the corner. Through the late 80s and into the 90s, as the details of the Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage came to the lascivious attentions of the tabloids, steam had been building behind demands for laws to control what the papers could print. Mrs Thatcher asked Wakeham to explore ways of making controls work. He reported (by then to John Major) that they couldn't. \"I've always been sympathetic to a free press. It's very high on everyone's list of characteristics of a free society. I persuaded John Major that it was better to try to let self-regulation assert itself and the press took it on, and set up the Press Complaints Commission.\" In 1995, \"by a whole range of coincidences\", Wakeham, newly out of government, became PCC chairman, and for the second time in his life, found the perfect playground for the intuitive negotiator, the man who likes to make things run smoothly. High on his list of priorities were the dire relations between the palace and the press. Wakeham carefully enumerated the areas for negotiation: a balance between the young princes' right to the same treatment as any other children and the press's legitimate interest in the way they were growing up; the palace's failure to find the right moments to present the princes to the press - and the danger of Prince Charles passing on his contempt for the media to his sons. The answer to these problems seems to have been Wakeham's protege Mark Bolland, former director of the PCC but now a senior figure in Prince Charles's entourage and widely credited with transforming the relationship between St James's Palace and Fleet Street. Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, says Wakeham is \"magnificent\". \"He is one of the most adroit and adept managers and fixers I have ever dealt with. One of his great qualities is that he always calms everything down, he stops people acting on the spur of the moment. He makes everyone think they've got the best deal. He's a brilliant manipulator, in the best sense of the word.\" If the royal story looks better though, there are plenty of critics of the PCC's clout in the more run-of-the-mill episodes of press manipulation. The number of complaints has doubled, and only a couple of months ago a tabloid was in the dock again over paying a witness in the Gary Glitter trial. \"It's a complete waste of time,\" said one ex-colleague of Wakeham, not one of his admirers. \"He's got absolutely no vision at all. He only ever asks how instead of why.\" On the other hand, demand for legislation has gone quiet and, Wakeham says darkly, the tabloids have far more intrusive stories they could print and don't. He believes they are behaving more responsibly. You can see that the whole idea of the law being used to resolve disputes is unattractive to him. You go with the flow, he believes, tightening the voluntary code as he did, for example, after Princess Diana's death, when resistance is weakest, and do all you can to avoid challenges on points where you won't carry popular support. But the Wakeham magic is not infallible. In 1996, he stepped into the poisonous brew of British horseracing. He became chairman of the recently-founded British Horseracing Board, set up to try to unite for the first time the diverse interests of bloodstock breeders, owners, trainers and racecourse owners. He was supposed to be using his influence in Whitehall to get some tax concessions. He failed: not only did he not win the concessions but he did not even get an agreed position to present to government. \"He hadn't taken on board how difficult it is to control a collection of sectional interests, some of whom are there only for their own ends,\" says one close student of his progress. \"The BHB's founding principle was that everyone was united in seeking the greater good of the industry. But when it came to the crunch, they all fought like cornered rats for their own interests.\" \"He didn't handle himself very well,\" one of the grander grandees muses. \"For the first time, probably, he found himself in a world without sanctions. He didn't have the authority to make people agree. So he walked out.\" In the view of the old Jockey Club types, he decided to protect his reputation rather than lay it down for the greater good of the sport of kings. Wakeham was bruised by the experience. He doesn't like to fail, even if he thinks it's everyone else who's in the wrong. It undermines his conviction that in the end, anything can be settled by a clever deal. It was one of those deals which got him into racing in the first place. He wanted to sail. His first wife Roberta wanted to go racing. \"So I used to put all those entrance badges you get each time you go racing into a little box on my desk, and every time we went sailing I'd take two out. As long as there were badges in the bowl, I felt it was OK to go sailing.\" Sailing, Wakeham's lifelong passion only recently given up because he feels he's no longer nimble enough, is itself the ultimate negotiation between man and the elements, where your very life can depend on an accurate assessment of external factors and their influence on your chosen course. Of course sailing is much easier if you don't much mind where you make your landfall. Wakeham, whose hero, oddly, is the uncompromising Admiral Nelson, now awaits judgment on what could be the most enduring of deals he has ever worked on, the future of the House of Lords. He has to navigate a course to a second chamber which doesn't challenge the role of the Commons (can't be all elected) or put unacceptable powers of patronage into prime ministerial hands (can't be all appointed) but which does, somehow, find a way of reflecting the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. \"The Lords has got to be complimentary to the Commons: the Commons has the democratic mandate but the Lords has to be the house of authority. And you can argue that part of that authority must come from the people. The politicians have got to have the final say because otherwise the report will just gather dust on the shelves the way royal commission reports do. And, if you're going to make constitutional advance it is infinitely better if you can get as broad a cross-section of support as possible.\" So, don't hold your breath for radical ideas. Like devolution, the new House of Lords is more likely to be a process than an event. But if it's a success, John Wakeham will have built a fine memorial for himself as the man who could make things work.

The two scientists claim that rape conferred an evolutionary advantage on its perpetrators, a notion that has outraged many groups. Evolutionary biologists Professor Randy Thornhill, of New Mexico University, and Craig Palmer, of Colorado University, have also provoked fury by suggesting that young women be advised that 'the way they dress can put them at risk' while young men should receive instruction so they do not 'mistake a woman's friendly comment, or tight blouse, as an invitation to sex'. These claims are outlined in Thornhill and Palmer's book, A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion (to be published in April by MIT Press), extracts of which have recently been published in the journal The Sciences. Social scientists and feminist scholars - who believe rape is a crime of violence, not sex - have reacted with fury. Rape expert Mary Koss, of Arizona University, dismissed the notion that young men should be educated about the evolutionary origins of rape. Thornhill and Palmer, she said, 'have obviously never stood up before a group and given a rape prevention talk'. She called their advice about dressing attractively ' unacceptable'. Reports about the book have also infuriated British feminists. 'These are outrageous assertions,' said Sandra Horley, of Refuge, the United Kingdom charity which helps the victims of domestic violence. 'Rape is about power and control, not about sex. Rape is violence, and nothing to do with sex. And if it is about evolution, then what does what women wear have to do with anything?' But anthropologist Donald Symons, of the University of California at Santa Barbara, backed the two scientists. 'This is an argument for a particular view of male sexuality and it's a view I think is correct.' Thornhill and Palmer say rape - although inexcusable - must be viewed as a 'natural biological phenomenon'. They say young women at the peak of their childbearing years are over-represented among rape victims - suggesting that reproduction is the prime motivation. But Koss added that a surprisingly large number of rape victims are children. Thornhill and Palmer's use of violent sexual acts committed by other species to buttress their arguments has also caused anger. 'We can't ask a female fish whether she appears to resist because she doesn't want to copulate or because she is testing males for their fitness,' Dr Jerry Coyne, of Chicago University, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/jan/16/efinance.business2","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-16T01:06:38Z","webTitle":"Who's going to pay for this romance?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/16/efinance.business2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/16/efinance.business2","fields":{"headline":"Who's going to pay for this romance?","bodyText":"Having broached the subject of the fabulous new 'ignorance economy' last week, I was gratified to see a full working demonstration in operation over the past five days. No one would disagree that potentially the world's largest merger between the former cowpoke network, AOL, and the grand old man of media, Time Warner, is by many measures a great deal. Especially if you are AOL chief executive Steve Case and have turned a volatile and speculative market capitalisation into something more solid. But the fact that the valuations of both companies' shares have danced up and down like a dog at a fair since the deal was announced underlines that, even in the Wall Street Universe of Masters, there is plenty of uncertainty on the meaning of life. In London we love to dwell on these glamorous deals without a backward glance at how they might affect our own businesses. Plenty of previous alliances - such as Disney ABC and the recent CBS/Viacom tie-up - have failed to register even a flicker in the corporate world, let alone change the output of our media or intrude on our tight and largely parochial set of mini-moguls. But the sudden realisation that - duh - dot.com-mad valuations can be leveraged with a bit of muck and sweat into real cashflow and old media has sent shares in London completely haywire. On Friday, BSkyB's share price took off like a rocket - rising 15 per cent or so to over 1200p. Panting along in its wake was EMI - the music company has leapt from 564p after millennium weekend to 690p as the market figured that a dot.com is as likely to buy a music publisher as another music company would be. And then there is the miraculous Pearson, which has streaked from 1700p on 7 January to 2141p at the end of last week. Everywhere the story is the same - it's the Time Warner effect. Ask the wiseheads of our communications businesses what they make of it and the response is optimistic but less hysterical. Sir Martin Sorrell, the only Brit who actually runs a global communications business from London would say it's more of the same - Americanisation rather than globalisation - and another step towards the converged world we have expected for some time. Marjorie Scardino, a non-exec director of AOL and an exemplar in media management at Pearson through her combination of focus and investment, takes the view: 'It's not whether we are \"old\" or \"new\" media or \"online\" or \"offline\" that matters; it's how we use our content across all channels that will make us winners.' And of course the eventual beauty of the Internet is that it offers one platform for everything - apart from the paper through your door, for those who still like a crossword on the bus. And this is why Bill Gates is retiring from running Microsoft back into a life of writing code. (What does it say about a man of unimaginable wealth that his personal ambition, having stepped back from the tumult of day-to-day business, is to spend more time with his computer? It's either sad or sweet). Retreating into the 'technology' side of his business is Gates shorthand for cracking the code to a new kingdom, probably television, by designing software which will eventually be as ubiquitous on our TV sets as Windows is on the PC. What every media and communications boardroom in the country is fretting about is whether they are big enough and whether they are Net-friendly enough. The truth is that none of their directors can really answer that for sure. And just to spread the uncertainty, in every Internet boardroom in the country directors are worrying what sort of deals they need to do with the 'old media' laggards to ginger up their content. Only the cynical would be sitting back and excitedly waiting for Freeserve to make a bid. But while it is easy to get swept up in the romance of a world in motion, there is still one factor largely overlooked. And that is just who will pay for these new romances? The Internet might reduce a burden of fixed cost when it comes to pushing telly or print or radio into the homes of consumers, but the jam tomorrow will be what consumers are prepared to pay for their content-rich existence. The explosion of disposable income will melt like a sundae on St Kitts once world economies take a downturn. For every leap in the share price of a media company there must, at some point, be an advertiser or a customer who eventually pays just a bit more for their football or FT.

Tom Nairn is too clever to be instantly readable; every point he makes, every paragraph, leads you into musings of your own, historical and political, so that when the eye finally returns to the page the brain is weary but hungry for more. The subtitle of After Britain is 'New Labour and the Return of Scotland', but readers south of the border, traditionally fiercely uninterested in matters of Scottishness or the constitution (and hardly more interested traditionally in their own 'Englishness'), can, if they must, ignore the momentous upheavals in Edinburgh and simply concentrate on the lengthy chapter 'Blair's Britain'. This is a work of such astute, vigorous import to them all that it should be turned into a pamphlet and force-faxed to every PR and spinner in the land whose sense of history begins and ends with their last coke deal, or perhaps written in foot-high Day-Glo letters on the skin of the Dome. Because the time would seem to have come for this debate. Everywhere one turns these days, someone is trying to further analyse the state of 'Englishness' at its interregnum, with Empire long dead, the peripheries of the British archipelago splitting with indecent haste, hereditary peerages buried and the monarchy increasingly pinguid. With the old Britain dead and no new entity rising to take its place, it raises the question: what is going on in England? Significantly enough, most of those trying to answer the question seem, at the moment, to be non-English - the Scots Andrew Marr and Gavin Esler, the Trinidadian Darcus Howe and now Nairn, a Scot living in Ireland who wrote the book in America. Those all-English commentators who could have made an honourable stab at the subject - I'm leaving aside the obviously mad ones, the Heffers and the Hitchenses - have left it noticeably alone; Simon Jenkins, for instance, spent his fin de siècle travelling around his country to find out whether England's ancient churches were as pretty as ever. As the debate gathers force, Nairn's work deserves to become the intellectual keystone at its centre. Others will provide valuable snapshots of the way England is today, set in the context of recent history, but Nairn, the man who correctly predicted the break-up of Britain in his 1977 book of that name, has given us the huge, sweeping historical overview, reminding us that, in the words of Lord Dacre: 'The people of these islands have seldom been united, politically or culturally. Efforts were made to unite them from the twelfth century onwards, but they only came under the same monarch in 1603, and the complete political union, which was at last achieved in 1801, endured only until 1922. Since then the process has been reversed...' Nairn shows sublimely how the process of reversal is speeding up and predicts what must, by force of history, come next. He demonstrates, carefully, how first Margaret Thatcher, then Tony Blair, attempted to build a new élite to keep an old 'Britain' alive in the absence of the Establishment, and how their respective efforts - be it Thatcher's philistinism or Blair's 'gymnastics of sincere deceit' - were, and are, doomed. Nairn, as an old Marxist nationalist, could hardly be expected to praise any aspect of Thatcherism; more devastating is his demolition of Blair's pretence at radicalism. This is a government, he argues, which by determinedly failing to address any of the huge historical issues confronting Britain with increasing urgency - the need for a written constitution, the end of a confused and confusing monarchy, self-determination for its constituent countries, relationships with Europe - is 'steaming in circles', and destined only to preside, some time soon, over the final break-up, with Scotland leading the way. It needn't have been that way. But the token nods towards such issues, often insulting in their smallness, have merely demonstrated that, far from bringing any of the necessary radicalism to Britain, Blair and his cohorts have, says Nairn, simply tried to create a new, similarly doomed, élite to keep the old ways going (albeit on life-support systems). Blair's 'totalitarianism' and control-freakery are, he demonstrates, simply 'a response to the prolonged withdrawal symptoms of collapsing Britishness', rather than any meaningful attempt to address the massive underlying constitutional problems; once again, 'radicalism [will] boil down to staying afloat'. He goes even further, arguing that this process has been taking place since the early Nineties. The whole post-John Smith 'project' was not simply to make Labour electable but to begin the formation of this new élite which would, far from ditching the old Britain, simply tinker with the peripheral software while keeping the central processing unit intact. It's an argument that may be giving the ahistorical Blair a touch too much credit, but it holds a surprising amount of water. It is known, for instance, that Charter 88, the constitutional reform group set up by Nairn's friend and amanuensis Anthony Barnett, was, despite the lip-service paid it by New Labour, one of the two groups of people Blair has been heard to call 'wankers' (the other being Scottish journalists). Along the way, Nairn has a certain amount of fun. The chapter on Blair's Britain is worth reading if only for the brilliant, unsettlingly apposite analogies with A Man Without Qualities, Robert Musil's satire on the death-throes of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He is also enough of a good old Scots leftist to let rip when truly angered, to remind us of the jaw-dropping absurdities of the unconstitutional country in which we live, such as the time when Thatcher broke a decades-old convention to press-gang a Lords vote on the poll tax: 'It was a fully Ethiopian spectacle worthy of some Disraeli novel. Bentleys and ambulances laden with Thatcher worshippers converged upon St Stephen's Palace from every decayed estate in the kingdom, so that the undead might vote through the century's most unspeakably stupid legislation.' In the end, Nairn doesn't make constitutionalism sexy. It's not, so there would be no point in trying. What he does do, far more crucially, is make it important once more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2000/jan/17/millennium.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-17T01:20:32Z","webTitle":"Dying to see in the millennium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/17/millennium.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/17/millennium.uk","fields":{"headline":"Dying to see in the millennium","bodyText":"It is no secret that many people were dying to see in the millennium but only now is it possible to quantify the extent of the phenomenon. Far more people than expected died in the first week of this year and researchers believe the ability to postpone one's demise until just after significant events is behind it. The Office of National Statistics in the United Kingdom said that 20,772 people died in the week to January 7, an increase of 65% on the 12,629 in the previous week. Even taking the flu epidemic into account, this is way ahead of the average of 15,900 who have died in the first week of each of the previous five years. In New York City, 1,791 died in the first week of 2000, a 50.8% rise on the 1,187 in the same period in 1999 and 46% above the 1,226 in the final seven days of last year. This year's figures were not affected by flu, which was running at normal levels in the city. \"It does look significant,\" said Robert Butler, founder and president of the International Longevity Centre. \"The will to live can be pretty powerful.\" Richard Suzman, associate director of the National Institute on Aging, in Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"It's pretty well established that people who are seriously ill will hang on to reach significant events, whether they be birthdays, anniversaries or religious holidays. \"In this case, making it into the next century or millennium certainly counts as that. The mechanisms are something of a mystery but the phenomenon is very real.\" One specific example was offered by Joel Potash, medical director of the Hospice of Central New York, Syracuse. \"We had one person who was on intravenous fluids and said, 'I want to make it to the new millenium and then you can stop the IV.' \" Dr Potash did not reveal whether the fireworks in Sydney, the crystal ball in Times Square, or the sight of Tony Blair holding hands with the Queen were enough to make the patient soldier on a little longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/jan/17/classics.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-17T15:21:19Z","webTitle":"The vast show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/17/classics.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jan/17/classics.comment","fields":{"headline":"The vast show","bodyText":"For some time in the 80s, Sting owned the rights to Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy. The pop star spoke of a possible movie, although what everyone really dreaded was a concept album. Neither materialised, although he did appear in a radio version. The books have finally been screened as a four-part drama (Gormenghast, BBC2, tonight, 9pm), and though the cast includes almost every senior British character actor - Ian Richardson, Warren Mitchell, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths - those who know the history of the attempts to film the book will inevitably think: where is thy Sting? And, indeed, sting. In theory, this should be the perfect time to televise Gormenghast. Fantasy literature - in its various forms, from Terry Pratchett to David Eddings - is as busy a genre as the strange scuttling little creatures who tend to inhabit such imagined worlds. And digital technology allows for off-the-map gothic locations - such as Peake's mythical aristocratic kingdom of Gormenghast - to be visualised more vividly than ever before. Certainly the BBC seems unusually confident in the project. It is hard to recall another drama advertised and trailed so enthusiastically. And what do you get? Admittedly, Peake has always seemed to me to be a writer who attended a lecture on Dickens and fell asleep after a few lines about grotesques. Each character is allotted a silly name and a single mannerism. The chef is fat and called Swelter (if you can't stand the heat). The 76th Earl of Groan is Lord Sepulchrave and is, indeed, not famously cheerful. Ian Richardson is a television actor of orchestral range, but can do little with this single note of whimsy. Only John Sessions - experienced as an impressionist in fattening out one characteristic - gives a full twitching and scheming inner life to his character, Dr Prunesquallor. Waking up at the end of the Dickens lecture with his worryingly sparse notes, Peake seems to have supplemented his material with some general borrowings from myth and fairytale. There are ugly sisters and various gargoyle employees, but only one legendary borrowing - a grotesque Nativity sequence involving the birth of the Groan heir Titus - interestingly renovates the details. Schoolboy name jokes - the nursemaid is called Nanny Slagg and the name of the hero Titus contains both a breast pun and a beer one - combine with student politics. Whereas Tolkien at least ensured that those who could be bothered might agonise over what the characters and symbols meant, Gormenghast - conceived while Peake was doing national service - is an obvious but wobbly metaphor for the English class system. The crazy and collapsing aristocrats - the Groans - are challenged by the cowering underlings who staff their castle. But, while the ideology may be picture-book, the pictures are at least impressive. In giving the book a look, director Andy Wilson has intriguingly drawn on the discovery that Peake spent his childhood in China. So the sets - which you feared would be rather too Great Elf - are more Last Emperor. Yet, even here, it seems to me that digital and computer technology is more impressive when it recreates reality - for example, the extinct natural history of Walking With Dinosaurs - rather than visualising fiction. The great limitation of fantasy fiction - that the writer is not bound by either the rules of physics or the reality of history - affects Gormenghast at every level. The best aspect of the series is to remind us - as did the recent BBC David Copperfield - that casting is an art in drama. At a time when the budgeting and eventual success of a project is often assumed to depend on the presence of one star (usually David Jason or Robson Green), Copperfield and Gormenghast have subtly drawn from different fields of performance. The Christmas Dickens employed both Maggie Smith and Pauline Quirke, from very different sides of the theatrical sheets, while this Peake piece intriguingly teams Ian Richardson the theatrical grandee with June Brown (Dot Cotton in EastEnders) as Nanny Slagg and Hammer film veteran Christopher Lee as the manservant Flay. Andy Wilson has made the interesting point that television adaptations have concentrated too much on the 19th century and that there should be more versions of works published in viewers' lifetimes. He's right, but Gormenghast - which is, anyway, a pastiche of earlier literature - is not the text to make that case. It's appropriate that the screen version of the Peake should finally emerge at the same time as Raul Ruiz's movie adaptation of Proust. If bringing A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu to the screen has been the fantasy project of highbrow film-makers for several decades, turning Gormenghast into pictures has long been the dream of middlebrow television. In both cases, the books were left on the shelf for so long because they were, in different ways, such literary experiences, achieving their best screening in the heads of readers. With Dickens, television has been able to ground the stories in historical and social realism. Gormenghast is panto Dickens taking place in limbo, just funny names and dusty jokes. After only three weeks it seems right to use for the first time the insult all critics have been storing up. Gormenghast just feels very 20th century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2000/jan/18/artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-18T10:43:59Z","webTitle":"The walking wounded of Wonderland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/18/artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jan/18/artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"The walking wounded of Wonderland","bodyText":"What does London look like? Like the film Notting Hill - verdant bowers in private squares and next to no black people? Like Sliding Doors - sunny porticos, chic restaurants, Gwyneth Paltrow's English simper? Or like Nil by Mouth, a brutalist Peckham never imagined even in Del Boy Trotter's philosophy? In his new film Wonderland, Michael Winterbottom has tried to depict another London. This is not some touristic confection, nor an unremitting hell hole - it's a London that you may actually recognise in all its splendid grubbiness and tatty grandiosity. At the start, for instance, Gina McKee does a runner from a blind date in the Pitcher and Piano bar in Dean Street. And who can blame her? She towered over this ageing troll of a man as they shouted awkward pleasantries at each other in the beery crush. It was never going to work, not even for one night. You watch her walk, vulnerable, hunched and with a daft hairdo, through Soho. And then three things happen. First, you become conscious of the press of people, the yellow London brick, the neon. The colours drizzle and glisten wetly, like they do when Scorsese films New York at night, although here the density of the crowds and the buildings, as well as the grainy film stock that Winterbottom uses, give this scene a cherishable London specificity. Then Michael Nyman's sumptuous, romantic soundtrack starts up, full of emotional import that you can't quite yet account for, but that nonetheless helps lift this quotidian scene out of glum English realism. Then, thirdly, the film speeds up. In this stop-frame section, the colours blur and McKee is transported through the streets as though she's got a jet pack in her duffel bag. Winterbottom says that he was influenced in these scenes by Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express, and here he has created a visual parallel to Kar-Wai's seedily beautiful neon-and-noodles Hong Kong. Yet at the same time he shows what London looks like to his characters: a rush of poignant colours and noise, a floating world that signifies all too much. Winterbottom takes a pull on his beer. We're sitting in a London touristic confection, a poncy hotel bar opposite the BBC. Around us men in black ties and kilts, and women in ball gowns mill in preparation for some Scottish corporate nightmare of an evening. In Wonderland, Winterbottom sullied this same hotel by setting a scene in an upstairs room. There, a couple from Manchester have a weekend birthday shagfest under the doubtless encouraging gazes of Eric Gill's reliefs on Broadcasting House opposite. Winterbottom explains what he was aiming for with Wonderland. \"I was trying to bring out a London that I felt I hadn't seen on film before. London is a restless place and people have to struggle to keep their heads above water. I wanted to show that. I think the basic issues are the same wherever you live, but you're going to be more conscious in a city of 7m of how many people you see during the day who you don't know. The techniques came out of what we were trying to do with the film.\" London was captured by vérité, documentary-style techniques: a tiny crew working with a hand-held camera, natural lighting, no boom microphones, no clapperboard, real locations. \"We put the characters among real people in London to be more true to the place. What normally happens in a film is that you'll shoot an 11pm pub scene at 11am in the morning. The pub will be empty and you'll fill it with extras saying 'rhubarb' to each other. And then you'll edit out all the 'rhubarbs' and put over talking tracks, which feel false. Instead, we decided to film the scene in the pub at 11pm when it's full of people who are drunk and are preparing to go home.\" Wonderland is set over a Bonfire Night weekend and mostly concerns the struggles of three sisters to make human connections in a dislocating city. But Winterbottom denies that the drama is at all Chekhovian: \"Initially the script was like Short Cuts [Robert Altman's LA-set film] and the connections between the stories were purely down to geography. But as we talked about it we came round to the idea that actually they should be three sisters, with a family built around them. The story of one sister tells you something about the other two.\" The problem with the film stems from the inability of Laurence Coriat's script to create convincing characters. Typical is Gina McKee's waitress Nadia, who can only find dates through lonely hearts columns and is prey to every oaf she thus encounters. But how did Nadia get this way? We are given no insight into her struggles or her grinning social ineptitude. And in the cast of sad and incompetent humans who populate Wonderland, we are never really encouraged to understand why these people are unable to master their fates. As a result, the film often becomes alienating and infuriating. Worse, Coriat's script presumes to represent London as it is. And Winterbottom is in league with this presumptuousness. Near the end, the camera pulls back from a tower-block flat to reveal a dense wall of similar flats. It withdraws further to disclose a cityscape of tower blocks and St Paul's shimmering in the night. This, the syntax of this sequence suggests, is what London is like: hopeless people striving ineptly in bite-sized flats. And yet it's a lie, just like the tacked-on happy ending that follows. A few scenes nonetheless ring true. When Nadia returns home after a jaw-dropping piece of post-coital cruelty, she sits on the top deck of the 171 bus from Aldwych to the Elephant. Down the front a group of drunk friends are laughing loudly and photographing each other, forcing their good time on her. It's Saturday night and the condensation she wipes from the window is made up of her fellow travellers' beer breath and bonhomie. Through the window, it's the fag end of the night, and nothing's ever going to be right. The scene goes on for ages, but I didn't mind. Who hasn't had that experience of being out of joint with happiness? There aren't a lot of laughs in Wonderland. But then, it would be hard to imagine a Michael Winterbottom comedy. Since his feature film debut in 1995, his Winterbottomland has been a grim place, perhaps as you'd expect from one who cut his teeth on a documentary about Ingmar Bergman. First there was Butterfly Kiss (1995), a serial killer road movie set in north England starring Amanda Plummer and Saskia Reeves; then Jude (1996), a properly grim adaptation of Hardy's novel with Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet; next Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), a film substantially based on ITN reporter Michael Nicholson's adoption of a Bosnian child, starring Stephen Dillane and Woody Harrelson; then I Want You (1998) with Rachel Weisz in and out of love in Hastings - hardly a laugh riot. His next project, the western Kingdom Come, which he starts shooting in a purpose-built town in the Canadian Rockies in three weeks' time, will star Nastassja Kinski, Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich and Wes Bentley (soon to be seen and admired as a voyeuristic teen in American Beauty). It will be a story set in a gold rush town - typically, after the gold rush. Whatever Wonderland's shortcomings, Winterbottom does elicit some terrific performances, not just from McKee or Ian Hart (himself a wonderland of Scouse dysfunction). Both Jack Shepherd's weak husband and Kika Markham's embittered wife are desperately affecting. None of the leading actors is from London, though, and it grates to hear rough stabs at estuary English being made by Canadians, Scots and northerners. Though, to be fair, not as much as when Paltrow opened her gob in Sliding Doors. Wonderland has a sour vision of the world. Even the title is clunkingly ironic: baby Alice is born to one of the sisters during the weekend, into a city that seems anything but a wonderland. Winterbottom, 38, suggests that London becomes progressively unliveable as you get older: \"The new-born baby has all these endless possibilities. You even worry for the 11-year-old son, Jack, because his opportunities seem fewer,\" he says. \"As people get older you have that gradual reduction of where you can go. I suppose you could say that the older the people get the less happy they are.\" On the continent Winterbottom's work is regarded with a seriousness he despairs of ever finding here. At Cannes and Berlin the films of this Blackburn-raised, Oxford-educated auteur have been properly appreciated. \"In Europe, generally people are more interested that cinema should be judged in a respect other than box office returns,\" he says bitterly. \"Here people are more paranoid about box office: critics are more concerned about being seen to have an understanding of popular taste, rather than being a voice in the wilderness saying this is what you should watch.\" And perhaps, despite its many failings, we should watch Wonderland. There are some lovely human cinematic moments. When Jack goes to a firework display, there is a very upsetting scene. In the darkness we can just make out that something covert and cruel is happening: a little boy is getting mugged for his Walkman and rucksack by big vague adults. It's in the affecting shock of such scenes, when cinema is allied to everyday, eternal human suffering and not exploited to serve some bogus end, that Winterbottom gets beyond the inept conceits betrayed by the film's title. • Wonderland is on general release."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/2000/jan/18/2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-18T14:51:25Z","webTitle":"Children are unbeatable!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/18/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/18/2","fields":{"headline":"Children are unbeatable!","bodyText":"Alliance aims and statement The organisations listed below welcome the Government's intention to clarify the law on parental discipline. The traditional defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" works against the aims which we and the Government of a modern Britain share: the encouragement of positive parental discipline in all families, and assurance of effective child protection in the few cases where it is needed. We believe it is both wrong and impracticable to seek to define acceptable forms of corporal punishment of children. Such an exercise is unjust. Hitting children is a lesson in bad behaviour. Removing the defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" and thus giving children in their homes and in all other settings equal protection under the law on assault is the only just, moral and safe way to clarify the law. While technically this would criminalise any assault of a child, trivial assaults, like trivial assaults between adults, would not be prosecuted. There already exist adequate means to prevent unwarranted or unhelpful prosecutions. It would on the other hand ease prosecution in serious cases. It would eliminate the current dangerous confusion over what is acceptable and provide a clear basis for child protection. There is ample evidence from other countries to show that full legal reform, coupled with the promotion of effective means of positive discipline, works rapidly to reduce reliance on corporal punishment and reduces the need for prosecutions and other formal interventions in families. Using positive forms of discipline reduces stress and improves relationships between children, their parents and other carers.

He will soon find out the truth of this doubtful assertion. The Northern Ireland secretary has, in effect, adopted the radical recommendations of last year's report by Chris Patten into policing in the province. The strength of the force will be sliced down from 13,500 to around 7,500. New recruits will be drawn equally from the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities. The anti-paramilitary cutting edge of the force, the special branch, will be absorbed into a new anti-crime division. But the key change, in a land obsessed by symbols, will be symbolic. The name Royal Ulster Constabulary is to be replaced by the anodyne new title of \"police service of Northern Ireland\". Mandelson suggests that this is a relatively minor aspect of the reforms. But he is a shrewd operator, and must know that what he is proposing is not just the refettling of the RUC, but its destruction. Ever since it was resurrected from the ashes of the old Royal Irish Constabulary in the early 20s, the RUC's function has been to protect and perpetuate unionist hegemony in the six counties of Northern Ireland. In the old days, it did so crudely as an all but solidly Protestant tribal force. Since the introduction of direct rule by Westminster nearly 30 years ago, it has been more an instrument of the crown than of Stormont. But to an overwhelming majority of the Catholic nationalist community, it is at best unloved and distrusted. At the same time, to the Protestant unionist community, which has seen its political authority steadily eroded, it remains the only effective locally raised and (to a large extent) locally controlled bulwark against republican violence. The \"Royal\" in the title RUC was a reassuring if somewhat notional reminder that the force stood for the continuing union with the rest of the kingdom. Much more reassuring, of course, was the bias of a force which successive British secretaries of state have failed to make more representative: the RUC remains more than 90% Protestant. That statistic illustrates the depth of Catholic hostility to the force. It also reflects the ruthlessness of the various republican gangs who discouraged police recruitment in \"their\" community by executing the few brave souls who dared to join up. There is now a real chance that Catholics will feel free to take part in the impartial policing of the province. That is a huge gain. But against it must be set the real sense of disillusion within the loyalist community which wants peace, but perceives it to be coming at a bitter price. After all, more than 300 RUC officers have been murdered, and some 13,000 wounded, in defence of the concept embodied in the simple, potent word \"Royal\". In the end, the name may prove bigger than Mandelson supposes. Related documentary Northern Ireland: special report Cherie lays down the law The government is breaking EU law by denying millions of parents the right to take extra leave from work. So says Cherie Booth QC, aka Mrs Tony Blair. Wearing her wig as a leading authority on employment law, Booth has advised the TUC that the EU's parental leave directive is not being implemented properly in Britain. The directive allows mothers, fathers and adoptive parents to take up to 13 weeks' unpaid leave, to care for children under the age of five. The government has decreed that the rule will apply to parents of children born on or after December 15 last year. That excludes some existing 3.3m parents of children under five. Trade unionists are delighted with the Booth interpretation of the directive. They say they will step up their campaign to end what they call \"nursery apartheid\". Mrs Blair, meanwhile, says she would be happy to assist the TUC if it wanted to take legal action. All parties, naturally, dismiss any notion of embarrassment in Downing Street. But it is comforting, somehow, to know that when the Blair babe is born around May, both Tony and Cherie will be fully entitled to take themselves out of public view for 13 weeks.

Of all the issues that have divided society in Northern Ireland, policing is probably the most controversial. In the last 30 years the Royal Ulster Constabulary has faced demands completely unlike those faced by any other force in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the developed world. I would like to place on record the Government's deep admiration for the courage, resilience and professionalism with which the RUC has met these challenges. The accounts I have heard of personal tragedy, pain and loss in the RUC family are profoundly moving and humbling. 302 officers have been killed, and many thousands injured. We all owe the RUC a huge debt of gratitude. The George Cross is a fitting acknowledgement of their sacrifice. But in rising to the challenge, the RUC has inevitably, if unfairly, become identified more with one side of the community than the other. It finds it hard to recruit from the nationalist community and - with 88% of its members Protestant and only 8% Catholic - is not representative of all sides of the community. This is not a desirable state of affairs. The RUC itself is forward-looking and accepts the need for change. It is eager to police a normal society in a normal professional way, but it is held back by the burden of history. The talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement addressed but did not resolve these problems. Instead, Chris Patten and his colleagues were asked to design arrangements for, and I quote: \"a police service that can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen to be an integral part of, the community as a whole.\" The Patten Commission rose to this challenge and I pay tribute to them. Their report covers, among other things, composition, training, culture, ethos and symbols. My Rt Hon friend the Member for Redcar accepted the report in principle, and launched a period of consultation about the details. Since my own appointment, I have met all the interested parties and police groups and have listened carefully to what they had to say. The decisions which I am announcing today will be reflected in legislation which we will bring forward later in this session. In reaching them, I have been driven by, and have tried to keep in balance, three distinct but interdependent considerations: • representativeness; • effectiveness; • respect for the sacrifices of the past. I say \"interdependent\", because only a police service that is accepted and draws members from both traditions and is therefore accepted across the community can hope to be fully effective. And it is only by recognising the sacrifices of the past that we can move forward together to meet the challenges of the future. I am determined that the police in Northern Ireland should be modern, representative and effective, and no longer the fulcrum of antagonistic debate. However, Patten also points out that the implementation of some recommendations will, and again I quote, 'depend to a greater or lesser degree on how the security situation develops', and that judgements will need to be made on how and when they should be introduced. That is advice which the Government will, rightly, keep firmly in mind as we take this process forward. Human Rights Patten rightly places much emphasis on human rights. The Chief Constable and the new Policing Board together will be made responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive programme of action - including an audit to ensure full compliance with human rights requirements. We also accept a new police oath as proposed by Patten, which will be taken by all new recruits to the police service. I do not believe it appropriate for already attested officers to take the new oath, which would in any case raise significant legal difficulties. All officers will, however, receive human rights training, and will be required to behave in accordance with a Code of Ethics. This Code will be provided for in legislation, and will, like the new Oath, emphasise the priority to be given to human rights. Accountability The Government accepts Patten's recommendation for the creation of a new Policing Board, composed as the Report recommends, to replace the current Police Authority. The new Policing Board will be responsible for securing the maintenance of an efficient and effective police service and holding the Chief Constable and the police service to account. I am sure the House will wish to join with me in paying tribute to the work of the Police Authority over the last 30 years. Many have served with distinction on the Authority, and were prepared to come forward even when there was a direct terrorist threat against them. Two members of the Authority were murdered by terrorists. The contribution of the Authority, members and staff, will not be forgotten. Police planning process The Report recommends clarifying the roles of the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Policing Board. The broad thrust of the recommendations is that the Policing Board should play a more developed role - setting objectives, priorities and performance targets while leaving operational control and direction of the police firmly in the Chief Constable's hands. I entirely agree with the Report that the new Policing Board \"should be empowered and equipped to scrutinise the performance of the police effectively\". I therefore accept the recommendations and will introduce legislation accordingly, subject to the Chief Constable continuing to answer to me on all matters involving national security and the work of relevant agencies. DPPBs Patten proposed the creation of District Policing Partnership Boards to provide an element of local accountability. He envisaged that they should have a primarily consultative role with an ability to monitor police delivery against an agreed local plan, and I endorse this. He also proposed an additional community safety role, with powers to purchase services on top of normal policing. This latter activity is currently a subject being considered by the Criminal Justice Review. Until decisions are taken on this Review, which will be published shortly, I do not intend to extend their function in this way. It will be better, in any case, to concentrate initially on building up relationships at the local level in what I propose to call District Policing Partnerships. I also intend to consider further the arrangements proposed for Belfast, where I am not satisfied that it would be right to have four separate partnerships. Style, structure, size and composition of the police service Progress on the style of policing and the size of the police service will be critically dependent on the Chief Constable's assessment of the security threat and the public order situation. There will be no question of rushing forward with changes in the absence of a stable security environment. Subject to that overall proviso, in line with the Report, the Chief Constable has decided to re-organise the police service into District Commands based on District Council areas and geared towards policing in partnership with the community. District Commanders will have much higher levels of devolved authority under the overall command of the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable intends that this structural reorganisation will be underway by November this year. The Chief Constable will also re-organise Police Headquarters to produce a slimmer structure. Headquarters will in future take a more strategic approach to management and Special Branch and CID will both be retained and placed under a single Assistant Chief Constable, as the Chief Constable believes is desirable, when the security situation permits. The Government accepts Patten's recommendations on the future size of the police service - that is, a regular complement of 7,500 full-time officers - provided, as the Report says, that the security situation does not deteriorate significantly. We accept Patten's recommendation for the enlargement of the part-time Reserve and the discontinuation of the full-time Reserve - again, subject to the security situation. The severance arrangements to enable serving police officers, whether regular or reservist, to leave the police service will be generous and sympathetic. The Government is committed to finding the necessary resources. Negotiations with the police staff associations are currently in progress. I hope that these discussions will help all sides to agree arrangements which will address the concern which officers understandably have about their future. I attach particular importance to Patten's recommendations for action to transform the composition of the police service, which are essential to gaining widespread acceptability. I endorse the proposal for 50/50 recruitment of Protestants and Catholics, from a pool of candidates all of whom - I stress - will have qualified on merit. We propose that the requirement for this special measure should be kept under review on a triennial basis, with rigorous safeguards to ensure that the, rightly, challenging targets for recruitment do not diminish the standard required of recruits. There will be no question whatsoever of ex-terrorists joining the service. Name and symbols Madam Speaker, our aim is to develop a police service which is both effective and accepted throughout the community. This aim, as Patten recognises, also clearly bears on the name and symbols of the RUC. The issue here is not whether the name of the RUC is wrong or something not to be proud of. I understand exactly why serving and former officers, their families and indeed widows are proud of the RUC and its name. The issue is whether a change in name, underlining a new start, is a necessary and indispensable part of attracting balance in recruits. Of course it is not the only barrier to recruitment. There has been at times disgraceful intimidation of nationalists who wished to join the RUC. But a change of name was in Patten's view essential, and I agree. That change is needed to signal the new beginning which will, in particular, be symbolised by the arrival in the new training environment of the first recruits entering through the new independent procedures and selected on the new balanced basis. That point will come in the autumn of next year. At that point too, I will therefore bring into force the new title, which will be the Police Service of Northern Ireland, a name which I believe is preferable to that proposed by Patten. At the same time, a service badge incorporating this title will be introduced, after the new Policing Board has had a chance to address the issue. In this context, the RUC will wish to consider how best permanently to record the award to them of the George Cross last autumn. And finally, existing police memorials will remain as they are, and the colour of the uniform will not change. IT and Training The Government also accepts Patten's important recommendation for IT improvements to put the police in Northern Ireland at the forefront of communications and information technology, and for police training. I am also delighted to tell the House that we have accepted the case for a new Police College, and appropriate resources will be provided. These are in addition to a range of other forward-looking recommendations on practical policing issues, which I will not detain the House by detailing here, which we will also be implementing. Oversight Commissioner Finally, Patten recommends the appointment of an Oversight Commissioner, to monitor the implementation of those changes agreed by the Government. This appointment will not in any way cut across the responsibilities of either the new Policing Board or the Chief Constable, and the accountability which I and my colleagues have to this House on policing issues will not diminish as a result. The Oversight Commissioner will help create a first rate police service for the future. Conclusion Madam Speaker, the implementation of these changes will entail a major and challenging programme of work for the Government, the Chief Constable, the Police Authority (and in due course the Policing Board) but, most of all, for police officers themselves. It is not an overnight event but a process of change which will extend over several years. I am confident that the police will meet the challenge of change positively and with commitment. For those in the unionist community who have fears, I urge them to accept the need for significant change to create a police service in which all can feel they belong and with which all can identify. To nationalists who have for so long withheld their support from the police in Northern Ireland, I would ask them to reflect on the transformation that is planned and to reconsider their position. It is now time for them to support this programme of change; unambiguously to support the police; and to encourage young men and women from their community to join the police. The prize is a modern, effective police service drawing support and strength from all parts of the community. It is within our grasp. The proposals I have announced today should enable us to achieve it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/jan/20/guardianleaders","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-20T02:12:39Z","webTitle":"Have they no gratitude?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jan/20/guardianleaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jan/20/guardianleaders","fields":{"headline":"Have they no gratitude?","bodyText":"Ungrateful lot, the Belgians. Not only did the Brits save them from French intrigue and possible takeover in 1815 and 1830, but we also gave them sovereignty and a dynasty which has endured. We rescued them again, we like to tell ourselves, in 1914 and 1944-45, this time from the Germans. Yet now they are entertaining a court case to stop the tribute they were required to pay to the hero of Waterloo, in the shape of the permanent award to the duke's descendants of the proceeds of a rich slice of land near the battlefield. But the passenger on the Liège (Lüttich) tram might respond that it was the Prussian Blücher who ensured that Napoleon lost. Besides, Arthur Wellesley was an Irishman who in his later incarnation as two-times prime minister of Great Britain and Ireland was hardly a model of enlightened, socially inclusive government deserving praise and reward unto the nether generations, even if he did emancipate Roman Catholics. M Jean-Emile Humblet, who is suing his government over the forest and farm-land given to the duke (by the Dutch, then rulers of the Low Countries), makes an additional point. Reform of the House of Lords - Lord Wakeham's commission reports today - compromises the succession agreement made in the 19th century, and the Wellesley family are not short of a bob or two. Still, the Belgian state has been having a bad time lately. In the spirit of self-criticism some Belgians might conclude that the United Kingdom did them no great favour. Perhaps recent scandals and dissension have shown that the jumble of faiths, ethnic groups and languages thrown together (largely in pursuit of a British conception of Continental balance and island interest) in 1830 has not proved a durable creation.

It must have the authority to force the government and the House of Commons to think again and the confidence to use its powers wisely and effectively. \"However, the second chamber should not just be another home for professional politicians - there would be no point in having a second chamber identical to the House of Commons.\" \"[The commission members] are totally agreed that there should be a minority of regional members, we are totally agreed on the length of the term that they should serve, we are all agreed they should not be able to stand again and we are also agreed on the restriction of their ability to go back to the House of Commons.

However, it is very welcome that the commissioners have produced a unanimous report as this provides a sound platform for moving forward on a genuine cross party basis.\" Liberal Democrat spokesman Robert Maclennan: \"This report is shot through with dismal, old-fashioned, self-serving clubby attitudes. If its recommendations were to be given effect, the Lords would continue to be illegitimate and the public would properly disregard it. \"This is probably the least persuasive royal commission report to have been issued in my political lifetime. It is neither informed by democratic principle nor a practical concern to strengthen parliament's capability to oversee the work of central government.\" \"This report cannot form the sole basis of the discussions which will now start about the future of the second chamber.

The House of Lords is one part of the ancient triumvirate in the British constitution, which also includes the monarchy and the Commons. Representing the interests of the aristocracy, the lords historically combined with the \"commoners\" to challenge and check the power of kings. These days, the Lords is the second legislative chamber in parliament, responsible for amending and scrutinising the activities of the government-dominated Commons. Other democratic countries have a similar institution, often known as an upper chamber or senate. Who are the members of the House of Lords? Where the Lords differs from other upper chambers is the presence of hereditary peers - lords who inherit their title from their fathers (or, less frequently, their mothers). The 1958 Life Peerages Act enabled the prime minister to appoint life peers, who hold their position for their lifetime but cannot hand it down to their heirs. These are known as \"day boys\" by the hereditaries; \"Tony's cronies\" by today's Tories. Also seated in the chamber are 26 bishops, reflecting the Church of England's role as the official state religion, and 12 law lords. What does the House of Lords do? Like other upper chambers, the Lords is part of the legislative process, scrutinising the work of the Commons and the government. Most major legislative bills are designed by the government and are debated in the Commons before coming to the Lords, which can propose amendments or delay non-financial legislation. The 12 law lords also act as the UK's final court of appeal. Why is Labour reforming the Lords? The House of Lords is widely condemned as undemocratic: \"one of the most curious of the curious anomalies in British public life, defying all logic of democratic and secular politics\", in the words of political scientist John Kingdom. The presence of an unelected upper chamber mocks the principle of a representative democracy, in which all people are equally entitled to participate in politics. The law lords can both make and judge the law: this runs counter to the democratic ideal of a \"separation of powers\", which holds that the judiciary (courts), legislature (parliament) and executive (government) should remain independent of each other, checking and balancing each other's power. Self-interest also plays a part in Labour's decision to reform the Lords. Dismantling the chamber enhances Labour's reformist credentials. More importantly, abolishing the hereditary peers removes a key source of Conservative opposition to the government. Predominantly Tory, the hereditary peers have fuelled a number of revolts against Labour's legislation, including major opposition to Labour's welfare plans last autumn. What can be done with the Lords? There are two main options. The first is to create an upper chamber which is subservient to the government, sustaining the British tradition of a dominant executive. A House of Lords wholly nominated by the prime minister would be the most extreme example of this. Opponents argue that this would perpetuate the undemocratic imbalance of power in British politics, which makes government an \"elective dictatorship\". The second option is to create a second chamber similar to those in other western democracies: a directly elected, independent body, designed to check and scrutinise the power of the government, with no overlapping of judicial or legislative functions. Tony Blair is among those who believe this would undermine the Commons and introduce gridlock into politics, threatening the speed and efficiency with which the government can act. What has Labour done so far? Labour's House of Lords Act 1999 removed all but 92 hereditary peers last year. A further 10 were immediately granted life peerages by the prime minister, allowing them to stay in the Lords. Initially seeking the removal of all hereditary peers, Mr Blair was forced to approve this compromise before the Lords would approve his legislation. The new house first assembled for the Queen's speech on 17 November 1999. The 92 hereditary peers who remained were elected by their peers, after all published 75-word manifestos justifying their retention. Lord Onslow's manifesto read: \"It would be as vainglorious to proclaim a personal manifesto as it would be arrogant to list any permanent achievements.\" He was elected. What is the royal commission? The government has said reform will not stop here. But it has not decided what further changes to make to the Lords, which, by other countries' standards, is still absurdly undemocratic. A royal commission, chaired by Conservative peer Lord Wakeham, was established in 1999 to consider and make recommendations on the role and functions of a second chamber. It was supposed to report by the end of 1999, but disagreements among the academics and politicians who make up the body delayed its publication until now. Cynics observe that royal commissions are often used as tools of procrastination by governments wanting to be seen to be making reformist noises but unwilling to take legislative action. The highly respected Jenkins commission on electoral reform reported in November 1998, but the government has subsequently placed electoral reform at the bottom of its priorities. It is highly unlikely that Jenkins' recommendations will ever be adopted. What does the Wakeham commission recommend? Lord Wakeham's recommendations represent a compromise between government supporters, who wanted a fully-nominated chamber, and more radical reformists, who wanted a directly-elected second chamber. The commission recommends: • a significant minority of \"regional members\" chosen on a basis which reflects the views of the regional electorates; • a totally independent appointments system with a remit to bring in representatives from all sectors of society (rather than the present system of prime ministerial patronage); • a statutory minimum proportion (30%) of women; • fair representation for ethnic minority groups; • a broader range of religious representation. What the commission does not recommend is also significant. It fails to argue for a second chamber consisting wholly, or largely, of directly elected peers. What will happen next? Probably very little, although Lord Wakeham insists \"there is no sign\" that the government will abandon the reforms it started. The commission has offered a compromise but no clear lead.

Tory and Liberal Democrat peers, supported by retired law lords and Labour rebels, voted by 222 to 126, a majority of 96, to pass amendments to the criminal justice (mode of trial) bill and restore the right of the accused to choose jury trial Lords Leader Baroness Jay said passing the amendment had \"effectively killed the bill\". \"As amended it no longer represents government policy,\" she said \"We will not proceed with this bill and will be introducing a no 2 bill in the Commons in the present session.\" Despite the eviction of most of the hereditaries in November, the political balance of the house is still weighted against the present government - 232 Tories and 54 Liberal Democrats against 181 Labour peers, with 161 crossbenchers and seven non-aligned peers - so the success of the committee stage amendment is not unexpected. Nevertheless the margin of defeat represents an embarrassment for the government, as the bill's opponents included a large number of Labour peers . The bill proposed to restrict the right to jury trial in so-called \"either-way\" cases - such as theft, burglary and handling - but with the right to appeal against a magistrates' court's decision to try the case. The government argues that this will save an estimated £105 million a year, partly in reduced prison sentences, and lessen the trauma for victims who have to wait longer for crown court jury trials than for JP hearings. The bill's critics argue that the change would fail to make the predicted savings, would be perceived as disadvantaging people from ethnic minorities, and would erode a judicial tradition dating from Magna Carta. In a heated Lords debate, Liberal Democrat Lord Dholakia said a \"crucial\" argument against the proposals was the effect on black and Asian defendants, particularly when Government research on the issue was so \"inadequate\". \"At a time when the criminal justice system needs to take every step it can to repair the confidence of racial minorities abolishing the right to elect jury trial is a step in precisely the opposite direction. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said the bill's aims - to increase court efficiency and crack down on abusers - were laudable but admitted that she could not support it. \"The reason I oppose this bill and the reason I have supported this amendment, which I did with some pain in my heart, is because I think it is an issue of principle. \"I believe that the impact of this bill will be socially divisive and discriminatory ... and I think it does remove an important citizen's right.\" At the opening of the debate, Tory home affairs spokesman Lord Cope of Berkeley, asserted the peer's right to table an amendment. \"Some people seem to think that we, the House of Lords, should not pass this amendment because it is 'too important a matter',\" he said \"We are told we should stand back, hold our noses, and leave the decision to the House of Commons, that the elected house with its large government majority, fiercely controlled, should alone decide. \"But no one in the Commons was elected on the basis of the position in this bill. It formed no part of the Labour manifest. Indeed the Labour party were at that stage very strongly against the whole idea. \"If it came into any elector's consideration at the last election, Labour were elected to oppose this bill.\" He argued that the partly reformed House of Lords, comprising appointed peers and elected hereditaries, had the authority to vote down the bill. Lord Cope, a life peer and former MP, added: \"Perhaps in due course there will be a different second chamber in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile we must do our duty for which we were selected, and each of us must decide the issue and vote accordingly.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/jan/21/devolutionscotland.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-21T03:25:56Z","webTitle":"Brave heart but no cigar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/21/devolutionscotland.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/21/devolutionscotland.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Brave heart but no cigar","bodyText":"There are times when Eddie George must wonder why he bothers. He decamps virtually the whole Bank of England to Scotland, including two-thirds of the monetary policy committee, for a two-day bonding session and what happens? He gets into a slanging match with Alex Salmond of the Scottish Nationalist Party over whether Scotland would be better off if it could set its own interest rates at the same level as those inside the eurozone. On the face of it, cutting interest rates north of the border from 5.5% to 3% sounds like a wonderful idea. Mr George thinks not. He said Mr Salmond's policy ideas were \"naive and shallow\", pointing out that euroland may have interest rates at half the level of Scotland but has double the level of unemployment. The governor is right. Mr Salmond appears to think that his party's policy of independence in Europe would mean a monetary policy better tailored to Scotland's needs, but this is sloppy thinking of the worst kind. First, there is little evidence that Scotland's economic performance over the past few years has been out of line with the rest of the UK. Growth has been 2.6% a year on average during the eight-year recovery for Britain, 2.4% for Scotland. Second, the SNP believes that London is remote from Scotland, with the monetary policy committee knowing little about what economic conditions are like in the industrial belt of the lowlands or in the crofts of the highlands. This may be true, but it is hard to see how the situation would be improved by having monetary policy set in Frankfurt by the European Central Bank. To be sure, an independent Scotland might have a seat on the board, but it would command around 4% of the vote. Frankly, it is probably better off with Mr George in charge. Finally, there is the example of Ireland. The SNP appears to think that Scotland, removed from the dead hand of English control, can be the next Celtic tiger. This is moonshine. Figures yesterday showed that inflation in Ireland is climbing alarmingly fast, primarily because interest rates that are good for a weak German economy are bad for a booming Ireland. Lower does not necessarily mean better. An old wheeze It is impossible to avoid a cackle at the situation-comedy of Stephen Byers' calling in a full-dress department of trade and industry inquiry into Geoffrey Robinson's collapsed engineering concern, TransTec. Faced with a political problem that just would not go away, some bright spark has remembered the inspector-thingies of the 1980s. Great wheeze: pull in a couple of worthies, give them a year or five to do their interviews, allow their findings to get lost at the printers for another three years and then publish the tome on a Friday afternoon before Christmas in the certain knowledge that no one will read it even if they can remember why it was ordered in the first place. In fact, the last time inspectors were sent in under such circumstances was after the Mirror Group flotation eight years ago - and that report still hasn't seen the light of day. Still, the fact that we are now getting an independent investigation of the TransTec affair is a welcome move. Given the association of the former paymaster general with the company - he was its non-executive chairman until his appointment to the government in May 1997 - anything less would have attracted criticism. But while the decision to appoint outside inspectors clearly meets the independence test, it is not sufficient. As Mr Byers's statement indicates, it is important that the probe into TransTec is done quickly and its results made public. For the DTI inspectors, being thorough and impartial in their deliberations does not mean they have to work at the traditional speed of law. And this, of course, brings us to the question of what exactly will be done with evidence gathered. The inspectors have wide powers to demand information but that information can no longer be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings, thanks to the European court of human rights ruling in the case of Ernest Saunders v United Kingdom. This is not to say the inspections themselves are now worthless exercises. Not only can material gathered be used to press for disqualification of directors, and may be cited in civil suits by creditors seeking to lift the protection of limited liability, but inspectors produce reports that, as Messrs Maxwell, Fayed and others have discovered, stay on the record and can be quoted thereafter. That said, this may be an opportunity for Mr Byers - who would doubtless wish to be remembered as a reforming DTI chief - to turn his mind to whether the system under which they operate is the best that can be devised, or whether \"modernisation\" is called for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/jan/21/1","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-21T03:31:36Z","webTitle":"Five books about healthy eating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/21/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jan/21/1","fields":{"headline":"Five books about healthy eating","bodyText":"Improve Your Digestion by Patrick Holford (Piatkus Ltd, £5.99) Buy it at BOL Remember that your digestive system is the path towards the \"inner kingdom of your body\", so guard it.

One businessman, who has donated thousands of pounds to the party, has warned that he will withdraw support by the weekend unless a \"gang\" opposed to the party leader Michael Holmes \"disappears completely\". John Langham, a Dorset businessman, warned that UKIP was in danger of \"disintegration\" after the party's ruling body passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Holmes last year. Mr Holmes, one of three UKIP Euro MPs elected last June, refused to accept the vote which has led to the convening of an extraordinary general meeting in London tomorrow. Up to 1,000 party members are expected to pack into Methodist central hall in Westminster to decide whether to back Mr Holmes or UKIP's ruling executive. The anti-Holmes faction is being led by Anthony Scholefield, UKIP's party secretary, who accuses the party leader of being too soft on Europe. In a letter to Mr Scholefield, which has been passed to the Guardian, John Langham underlines the bitterness of the row engulfing the party. \"What you are doing is destabilising the party just at a time when it should be exploiting its success and when the British people are more and more Eurosceptic,\" the businessman wrote earlier this month. In a circular to party members, Mr Scholefield accused the party leader of \"unacceptable behaviour\" which culminated in his \"damaging speech\" in the European parliament which recommended an extension of its powers. Pro-Europeans last night seized on the party's internal feuding.

Its 216-page report, A House for the Future, contains 132 recommendations that the commission claimed to be \"persuasive and intellectually coherent but also workable, durable and politically realistic\". If implemented, the document says, no new member of the second chamber would arrive there on the same basis as any existing member of the upper house. The royal commission proposes a second chamber of around 550 members - the majority of whom would be chosen by an independent appointments commission, and the rest drawn from the regions by selection or direct election. Members would no longer be known as peers, and those who have been made peers through the honours list would not be members. The composition of the chamber as a whole would be regularly adjusted to reflect the balance of political opinion within the country. There would also be targets to reflect more closely the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix, with the goal of including members from all over the country and \"all walks of life\". The commission recommends the reformed chamber should be \"at least as powerful as the present House of Lords\" in providing a check upon the executive, with scope to examine human rights and constitutional issues. Its elected element should \"provide a voice\" for the UK's nations and regions. Overall the recommended upper house would be \"authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the United Kingdom\". Guide to the new power house Composition The make-up, in particular the balance between elected and appointed members, was the most significant and most contentious issue the commission had to consider. Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options. After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years. An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers. There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election. Appointed members There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments. There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman. This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment. The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance. Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election. According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority. Regional members Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election. Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections. Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election. Existing life peers and hereditaries Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members. Religious faiths A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths. The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths. Roles and powers The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\". It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it. The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament. While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs. The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers. Instead, though the Commons would gain the final say, the chamber would gain more moderate but usable powers to delay, and demonstrate its concern about, specific statutory instruments. Making law The commission argued there should be no significant changes in the law-making functions. However, to prevent bad legislation rushed through the house thanks to limited parliamentary time, the report argues for more pre-legislative scrutiny of draft bills. It also suggests the second chamber should look at how to speed up consideration of law reform bills drawn up by the law commission. In recognition of the growing volume of secondary legislation, the chamber should maintain and extend its power to scrutinise statutory instruments, the report said. Protecting the constitution The chamber's role in protecting the constitution should be \"maintained and enhanced\", the commission recommended. One of the most important functions should be to act as a \"constitutional long-stop\", ensuring changes are made to the consitution only with full debate and a clear idea of the consequences. A restriction on further amendments to the parliament acts would reinforce the right of the upper house to veto any bill to extend the life of a parliament - preventing any government voting itself into permanent power. The chamber would gain no extra powers over constitutional or human rights issues or legislation, but would set up a constitutional committee to scrutinise constitutional implications of all legislation. There would also be a human rights committee to look at bills with such implications.With the imminent implementation of the 1998 human rights act, the report points out, parliament will need such a scrutiny procedure. Representing the nations and regions Whatever future developments in devolution or decentralisation, the chamber should \"give a voice\" to people from throughout the United Kingdom, the commission said. Under proposals for a minority of elected members, the reformed house would have representatives from all over the UK, but these would not be drawn from the devolved administrations, or from the Scottish parliament and the other devolved assemblies. However, the report stressed that the reformed chamber should not become a \"federal legislature\" supporting a \"federal government\", nor a forum for liasion be tween the government and the executives of the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The house would not meet outside London, but some committees could meet in regional centres \"from time to time\". Holding the government to account The commission argued that ministers should continue to be drawn from, and be directly accountable to, the second chamber. It recommended increasing ministerial accountability by requiring senior ministers based in the Commons to make statements to and take questions from second chamber committees when appropriate. There should be more scrutiny of ministers' handling of European Union business, with additional resources for the European Union committee. Though British MEPs would not be represented in the chamber, it should promote greater cooperation between MEPs and parliament. More broadly, the commission recommended that the chamber continue to be \"a relatively non-polemical forum for national debate\", and that specialist committee work, drawing on the broad spread of expertise held by members, should continue. It also proposes a committee to scrutinise treaties laid before parliament and to draw attention to any implications which might deserve consideration by parliament before the treaties are ratified. The law lords The commitee was asked to judge whether the chamber should continue to carry out judicial functions through committees of law lords. It concluded that, as long as certain basic conventions were observed, there was no reason to change the present arrangements. The report argued there were advantages in having senior judges in the legislature where they could be made aware of social developments and political balances that underlay most legislation. However, in the light of controversy over the law lords' vote on the case of General Pinochet (which threw up concerns over the failure of one law lord involved in the judgment to declare his association with the human rights pressure group Amnesty International) the commission proposed requiring lords of appeal to set out in writing and publish a statement of the principles they intended to observe when participating in debates and votes and when considering their eligibility to sit on related cases. Characteristics The commission concluded that, taking account of its role and functions, the chamber should \"above all, be authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the whole of British society\". Its members, according to the report, should have a breadth of experience and expertise outside the world of politics; particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional and human rights issues; personal distinction; and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective and freedom from party domination. Nevertheless, though authoritative, the reformed second chamber should not challenge the ultimate democratic authority of the Commons. Titles and pay The commission concludes that, since the link between the honours list and the Lords would be broken, members of the upper chamber would no longer be known as peers. It floated the options of using the suffix LP (for Lord/Lady of Parliament) or the title senator, but made no recommendation. The report also stopped short of proposing a name for the second chamber, concluding that both titles \"should be left to evolve\". The commission proposed increasing the remuneration received by members of the second chamber to ensure they were able to afford to attend from all over the country and not only from the south-east of England. It argued that a clear link should be made between attendance and financial support, so that those who wished to devote significant time to parliamentary duties could afford to do so - without subsidising those who had a career and attended less frequently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/21/jurytrials.law","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-21T08:38:16Z","webTitle":"Lords torpedo wrecks Straw's jury bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/21/jurytrials.law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/21/jurytrials.law","fields":{"headline":"Lords torpedo wrecks Straw's jury bill","bodyText":"A government bill was wrecked last night when the Lords voted by 222 to 126 to keep defendants' right to choose trial by jury. The vote came during debate on the criminal justice (mode of trial) bill, despite a warning from the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who said the bill would be ruined if the rebel amendment was passed. \"This isn't really a wrecking amendment - it's a torpedo amendment and there's nothing left of the bill ... if this amendment is passed there's nothing left at all at this stage.\" He insisted he himself would have been unable to support the bill if it did not include a right of appeal. But he shared the \"overwhelming, virtually unanimous view\" of the judiciary that it was a \"proportionate outcome in difficult circumstances\". He urged peers to consider the issue \"in a way that is unencumbered by professional, social and historical baggage\". Opponents of the change were operating on the \"unspoken, insidious basis\" that magistrates courts automatically provided lower quality justice, he declared. But the foremost Labour critic of the bill, Lady Kennedy, told peers: \"This bill is wrong. It's wrong in principle and that is why it is opposed even by those who are friends of the government.\" The Conservative home affairs spokesman, Lord Cope of Berkeley , opening the debate, argued that the partly reformed House of Lords, comprising appointed peers and elected hereditaries, had the authority to vote down the bill. Lord Cope, a life peer and former MP, added: \"Perhaps in due course there will be a different second chamber in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile we must do our duty for which we were selected, and each of us must decide the issue and vote accordingly.\" Lord Jenkins of Hillhead attacked the home secretary for claiming the Liberal Democrat peer had endorsed the ending of trial by jury. He said Mr Straw had \"called in aid\" the 1967 criminal justice act - which brought in majority verdicts for criminal trials - that Lord Jenkins piloted through parliament when home secretary in the Wilson government. That was done because trials were being undermined by the growing practice of criminals targeting the most \"vulnerable or amenable\" members of a jury in order to ensure there was no unanimous verdict, Lord Jenkins told peers. \"I cannot allow, I'm afraid, Jack Straw to claim my endorsement for this ill-conceived little bill so directly contradictory to everything which he and his spokesmen said in opposition,\" he said. \"I utterly reject the view that this proposal is in any way the equivalent of my majority verdict proposals.\" Mr Straw did not have much of a reputation as a liberal, Lord Jenkins noted. But he added: \"If he will accept the defeat of this measure ... with a good grace, if he will be less grudging on freedom of information, and if he will take less of a knee-jerk Daily Mail attitude to the whole complex issue of crime and punishment, then maybe by the end of this parliament his reputation for humane sagacity might begin to gleam a little bit more brightly.\" Labour's Lord Lipsey said the case for the government's proposals was \"overwhelming - not from a lawyerly perspective but from a wider perspective\". On the argument that \"black people do not trust magistrates\", Lord Lipsey said: \"Some of them at least may opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an OJ Simpson. \"What they hope is that there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system. In my view they will be disappointed in this because I think all black jurors are absolutely as fair as white jurors but I think there is a tendency to do that and I don't think we should encourage it.\" Lady Kennedy accepted the need for more efficiency and cost effectiveness \"while protecting the rights of defendants\". Steps should be taken to crack down on abusers of the system - although Lady Kennedy questioned whether \"they are in anything like the number being suggested\". \"The aims I agree with are laudable. The reason I oppose this bill and the reason I have supported this amendment, which I did with some pain in my heart, is because I think it is an issue of principle. \"I believe that the impact of this bill will be socially divisive and discriminatory ... and I think it does remove an important citizen's right.\" It would reduce the number of jury trials which was \"an awe-inspiring act of citizen participation\". Magistrates would be put in the \"invidious\" position of having to \"pick and choose those deserving of trial, so that trial becomes a privilege\". Lady Kennedy suggested there were administrative changes that could be made to the legal system to produce the same result the government wanted from the bill. She said: \"The reason why the amendment is put in this form is because we would have wanted to find another way but there is no other way. This bill is wrong. It's wrong in principle and that is why it is opposed even by those who are friends of the government.\" Government's friends defy attorney general's warning Lord Jenkins \"I cannot allow, I'm afraid, Jack Straw to claim my endorsement for this ill-conceived little bill so directly contradictory to everything which he and his spokesmen said in opposition.\" Lady Kennedy \"I believe that the impact of this bill will be socially divisive and discriminatory ... and I think it does remove an important citizen's right.\" Lord Lipsey \"Some of them[black defendants] at least may opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an OJ Simpson.

If implemented, the document says, no new member of the second chamber would arrive there on the same basis as any existing member of the upper house. The royal commission proposes a second chamber of around 550 members - the majority of whom would be chosen by an independent appointments commission, and the rest drawn from the regions by selection or direct election. Members would no longer be known as peers, and those who have been made peers through the honours list would not be members. The composition of the chamber as a whole would be regularly adjusted to reflect the balance of political opinion within the country. There would also be targets to reflect more closely the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix, with the goal of including members from all over the country and \"all walks of life\". The commission recommends the reformed chamber should be \"at least as powerful as the present House of Lords\" in providing a check upon the executive, with scope to examine human rights and constitutional issues. Its elected element should \"provide a voice\" for the UK's nations and regions. Overall the recommended upper house would be \"authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the United Kingdom\". Guide to the new power house Composition The make-up, in particular the balance between elected and appointed members, was the most significant and most contentious issue the commission had to consider. Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options. After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years. An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers. There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election. Appointed members There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments. There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman. This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment. The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance. Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election. According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority. Regional members Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election. Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections. Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election. Existing life peers and hereditaries Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members. Religious faiths A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths. The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths. Roles and powers The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\". It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it. The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament. While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs. The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers. Instead, though the Commons would gain the final say, the chamber would gain more moderate but usable powers to delay, and demonstrate its concern about, specific statutory instruments. Making law The commission argued there should be no significant changes in the law-making functions. However, to prevent bad legislation rushed through the house thanks to limited parliamentary time, the report argues for more pre-legislative scrutiny of draft bills. It also suggests the second chamber should look at how to speed up consideration of law reform bills drawn up by the law commission. In recognition of the growing volume of secondary legislation, the chamber should maintain and extend its power to scrutinise statutory instruments, the report said. Protecting the constitution The chamber's role in protecting the constitution should be \"maintained and enhanced\", the commission recommended. One of the most important functions should be to act as a \"constitutional long-stop\", ensuring changes are made to the consitution only with full debate and a clear idea of the consequences. A restriction on further amendments to the parliament acts would reinforce the right of the upper house to veto any bill to extend the life of a parliament - preventing any government voting itself into permanent power. The chamber would gain no extra powers over constitutional or human rights issues or legislation, but would set up a constitutional committee to scrutinise constitutional implications of all legislation. There would also be a human rights committee to look at bills with such implications.With the imminent implementation of the 1998 human rights act, the report points out, parliament will need such a scrutiny procedure. Representing the nations and regions Whatever future developments in devolution or decentralisation, the chamber should \"give a voice\" to people from throughout the United Kingdom, the commission said. Under proposals for a minority of elected members, the reformed house would have representatives from all over the UK, but these would not be drawn from the devolved administrations, or from the Scottish parliament and the other devolved assemblies. However, the report stressed that the reformed chamber should not become a \"federal legislature\" supporting a \"federal government\", nor a forum for liasion be tween the government and the executives of the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The house would not meet outside London, but some committees could meet in regional centres \"from time to time\". Holding the government to account The commission argued that ministers should continue to be drawn from, and be directly accountable to, the second chamber. It recommended increasing ministerial accountability by requiring senior ministers based in the Commons to make statements to and take questions from second chamber committees when appropriate. There should be more scrutiny of ministers' handling of European Union business, with additional resources for the European Union committee. Though British MEPs would not be represented in the chamber, it should promote greater cooperation between MEPs and parliament. More broadly, the commission recommended that the chamber continue to be \"a relatively non-polemical forum for national debate\", and that specialist committee work, drawing on the broad spread of expertise held by members, should continue. It also proposes a committee to scrutinise treaties laid before parliament and to draw attention to any implications which might deserve consideration by parliament before the treaties are ratified. The law lords The commitee was asked to judge whether the chamber should continue to carry out judicial functions through committees of law lords. It concluded that, as long as certain basic conventions were observed, there was no reason to change the present arrangements. The report argued there were advantages in having senior judges in the legislature where they could be made aware of social developments and political balances that underlay most legislation. However, in the light of controversy over the law lords' vote on the case of General Pinochet (which threw up concerns over the failure of one law lord involved in the judgment to declare his association with the human rights pressure group Amnesty International) the commission proposed requiring lords of appeal to set out in writing and publish a statement of the principles they intended to observe when participating in debates and votes and when considering their eligibility to sit on related cases. Characteristics The commission concluded that, taking account of its role and functions, the chamber should \"above all, be authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the whole of British society\". Its members, according to the report, should have a breadth of experience and expertise outside the world of politics; particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional and human rights issues; personal distinction; and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective and freedom from party domination. Nevertheless, though authoritative, the reformed second chamber should not challenge the ultimate democratic authority of the Commons. Titles and pay The commission concludes that, since the link between the honours list and the Lords would be broken, members of the upper chamber would no longer be known as peers. It floated the options of using the suffix LP (for Lord/Lady of Parliament) or the title senator, but made no recommendation. The report also stopped short of proposing a name for the second chamber, concluding that both titles \"should be left to evolve\". The commission proposed increasing the remuneration received by members of the second chamber to ensure they were able to afford to attend from all over the country and not only from the south-east of England. It argued that a clear link should be made between attendance and financial support, so that those who wished to devote significant time to parliamentary duties could afford to do so - without subsidising those who had a career and attended less frequently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jan/22/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-22T02:14:24Z","webTitle":"Tension high for return of 'Mi General'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/22/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/22/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"Tension high for return of 'Mi General'","bodyText":"The military church is packed with worshippers on this balmy Santiago night. They kneel beneath the crossed-rifles banner of the police, they sit quietly as the army chaplain addresses them on the love of God and they rise to the strains of Ave Maria. But the beneficiary of their adoring prayers remains thousands of miles away in Virginia Water. The Pinochetistas have gathered for what they hope will be the last such mass before the return of Mi General which is daily anticipated as imminente in the Chilean press. The congregation of some 400 who have gathered in the Providencia district opposite the military hospital to hear the chaplain, Enrique Lehuele, praise Gen Pinochet and mock Jack Straw, are almost all women over the age of 50, a sub-tropical Conservative party conference with the general substituted for his biggest supporter, La Thatcher. There are a few younger supporters gathered outside. Pancho Malo, as he introduces himself, is wearing a Glasgow Rangers shirt. \"I like Paul Gascoigne,\" [who has, of course, long since departed Glasgow]. He backs the general: \"If it had not been for him this country would have been taken over by communists.\" A woman passenger in one of the capital's bright yellow buses makes a \"you-are-loonies\" sign at the crowd by twirling a finger beside her head. Two Pinochetistas immediately board the bus and furiously upbraid and threaten her. Tensions are high and any Britons or Spaniards in the vicinity are given a swift angry lesson on communism, socialism and the necessity for \"strong action\". A few miles up towards the Andes, in the wealthy suburb of Las Condes, a portrait of Gen Pinochet, casually dressed in beret and combat fatigues, smiles across the table. This is the headquarters of the Pinochet Foundation, the body set up to promote his beliefs and provide scholarships for young Chileans. And it is here that his supporters are waiting for news of the general's liberacion from the United Kingdom. Monica Wehrann of the foundation says: \"We find it hard to understand why there is so much hatred for him.\" Focus on fundraising The foundation's chief work over the past year has been raising funds for Gen Pinochet's considerable legal costs in London. Their current bulletin prints a picture of a member of his defence team, Clare Montgomery QC, and gives details of the latest legal news and demonstra tions in favour of the general in Chile and London. \"No, we are not angry with the British because so many of the British are supporting us - Lord Lamont, Lady Thatcher, many people,\" says Ms Wehrann, siting beneath the portrait and beside a bust of Gen Pinochet in his more familiar military cap. \"When he comes back, everything will be as before with Britain and Spain.\" She does not believe that Gen Pinochet will make political capital of his return: \"He is an old man, I don't believe he will be active. He wants to see his family.\" Leonora Gajardo, of the Comando Soberania Nacional, has been helping to organise the regular street demonstrations in favour of the general. She is adamant that the general is genuinely unwell and is not faking senility to avoid trial. \"I know he is ill, he will have to spend at least two months in hospital. He is suffering. He has been called a fanatic but he is just patriotic, he loves his people, he loves his country. He is a symbol of Chile.\" Ms Gajardo, an animated young woman from Santiago who has been involved in the campaign to have Gen Pinochet returned for more than a year, said that the international protesters against him did not understand what was happening in Chile in 1973. \"There were 1,000 Cubans here preparing for a civil war. The people asked them [the military] to intervene so that they could have something to eat.\" She does not think the return will provoke a violent reaction - \"only the socialists would provoke violence\". But equally she does not think that there will be a grand fiesta. \"It will be a moment for reflection.\" Whether Gen Pinochet carries out his reflections in the military hospital in the Providencia district or elsewhere when - or if - he returns is still a subject of discussion. The foundation believes he will go to the hospital, but it is located at a busy intersection and near tall buildings where human rights demonstrators could make their feelings heard. Another possibility is that he would avoid Santiago and go to the Chilean air force base in Iquique in northern Chile where he could be treated in the airborne medical facility that is due to take him out of Brize Norton. One woman who has had more time than many to reflect is Viviana Diaz, whose father, a leading communist and union organiser, \"disappeared\" in 1976, three years after the coup that brought Gen Pinochet to power. The poster that greets the visitor to the Families of the Disappeared off Avenida O'Higgins is of a group of those who are still missing with the slogan Donde estan? (where are they?): smiling young men with 70s' haircuts, smiling young women dressed as for a graduation photo, a small percentage of the 3,000 now officially believed to have been murdered during the Pinochet dictatorship. Morale boost \"We are still hoping that he will not be coming back,\" says Ms Diaz. Above her is a notice, changed daily, noting that it is now 461 days since Gen Pinochet was detained in London. She says that his arrest and the time that he has now spent out of the country had been a great morale-booster for all those who had lost family members. There are still 300 active members of the group but it is dwindling. \"All your life you continue looking but now there are mothers dying who never knew what happened to their children.\" But she is concerned that if Gen Pinochet returns he may never stand trial. \"His illness is just the illness of age. Here people who rob in order to eat go to prison while someone who has killed and tortured goes free. And the torture of not knowing what has happened [to a relative] is an ongoing torture. This is still an open wound for us.\" She is hopeful, however, that he will be prosecuted because the amnesty dealt only with crimes that had been commit ted in the past while a kidnap or disappearance, she said, was a continuing crime and thus could be pursued. This is a view shared by the crusading judge Juan Guzman, who is still anxious to pursue criminal charges in connection with more than 50 cases against Gen Pinochet and believes he is fit enough to stand trial. Ms Diaz, who has dedicated her life to the cause of the disappeared, takes her telephone off the hook at night because of the anonymous threats still made. Such threats were a feature of the Pinochet years, the main difference being that then they were often carried out. \"Happily, there has not been violence towards us recently.\" Protests against Gen Pinochet and a decision to release him are planned by the Assembly for Human Rights today in the Plaza Italia in Santiago. \"In Pinochet's case there is no room for clemency on humanitarian grounds,\" said Julia Urquieta of the assembly, \"because no clemency was given to the thousands of victims of the dictatorship on humanitarian grounds.\" Back in Providencia, the congregation departs waving Chilean flags and blowing whistles, ignoring the gestures of derision from people driving past. The church, with its tall mural of Christ tending the dying and the dead, is empty once more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jan/22/guatemala","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-22T17:51:10Z","webTitle":"Mystery of the Mayans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jan/22/guatemala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jan/22/guatemala","fields":{"headline":"Mystery of the Mayans","bodyText":"Once, the world was full of mysteries, some of them frightening, some of them wonderful, some of them merely fascinating. Now, it can be a banal and predictable place, the tracks of daily life so well-beaten and defined, our culture awash with the imbecile obvious, our existence suffocating in safety. But mysteries remain. On first acquaintance, the mystery of the Mayans of Guatemala can seem simply bizarre, as it was when I first encountered Maximon the god. He was easy enough to find. We left the main street of the village; followed the cobbled sidelanes, littered with scraps of paper and rotting banana skins; stopped at the scruffy grocer's shop with the blackboard sign outside; took the side alley into the muddy courtyard; and, sweeping back the grubby curtain on the little outhouse door, we entered the dimly-lit home of Maximon, eldest of the elders, wisest of the wise, god. Maximon is a life-sized model of a man with a golden face and beard, who wears a western jacket and a brown flat hat and who sits on a chair on a concrete floor with several plastic pots of flowers before him and a collection of balloons and old Christmas decorations in the ceiling above. This morning, he was busy. A middle-aged man, whose face was creased with fatigue, was kneeling before him in the darkness, talking rapidly, arguing his case for a favour, while two attendants tipped Maximon back in his chair, poured a long slug of rum down his wooden throat, placed him upright again and pushed a cigarette, alight and smoking, between his wooden lips. The middle-aged man lit candles and then retreated to await the result of his gifts. What is important about Maximon is that he is there at all. He is a pagan god and yet he survives in a Guatemala, whose official religion is high-octane, high-church Roman Catholicism; and he survives not only in this dusty backroom in the western highlands and not only in the popular faith of Mayan Indians, but also in the faith of the Spanish-speaking Ladino population, whose antipathy to the Indians has been infiltrated by a reluctant respect for their intricate beliefs. They go regularly to Mayan shamans, who will draw on all kinds of ancient magic, including the sacrifice of small animals, to give them power. And this is the real mystery of the Mayans - their survival, for their history is one of breathtaking destruction. They have been the victims of two terrible hypocrisies. In 1523, in the name of the Catholic God of love, Spanish invaders slaughtered them in their thousands, enslaved the survivors, accidentally infected them with smallpox and typhus and measles, and then unleashed their priests who used fire and the sword to purge their beliefs and to destroy every available artefact of their civilisation. In a single day in July 1562, a Spanish bishop advanced the cause of his God by ordering the collection and destruction of every Mayan manuscript and work or art that could be found, the treasure of 4,000 years of civilisation. Mayans died in such numbers that their population did not return to its pre-conquest level until the 1950s, by which time the second great hypocrisy was descending upon them. In June 1954, in the name of democracy and freedom, US President Dwight D Eisenhower authorised a coup to unseat the elected government of Guatemala, which was alarming American corporations by redistributing land to the Mayan peasantry. The director of the CIA, who ran the coup, was Allen Dulles; he also happened to be a director of the United Fruit Company, whose massive land holdings in Guatemala were most at risk from the progressive government. That coup cast Guatemala into 42 years of instability and military government, which restored land to the US corporations, executed their opponents and banned left-wing parties. When socialists threatened to recapture power in 1963, President John F Kennedy, in the name of democracy and freedom, authorised another coup and, when Mayan peasants organised armed resistance, Washington's puppets embarked on a strategy of terror to suppress all opposition. In the ensuing civil war, which ended only in 1996, some two million Guatemalans, most of them Mayans, fell victim to massacre, assassination, rape, abduction, torture, disappearance, enforced exile and displacement, almost all of it supported by military aid from the most powerful country on earth. And yet the Mayans survive. And the strangest, most eery, most powerful symbol of their survival (far more potent than Maximon and his strange rituals) lies far away in the north of the country, in the dense, screeching jungle of the Peten region, tangled in among the jumble of breadnut trees and creepers, most of it still buried under layers of encroaching vegetation - the lost cities of the ancient Mayan kings. Truly, these are mysterious places. You fly from Guatemala City for just under an hour to the island city of Flores, which sits in the flat blue middle of Lake Peten Itza. The dusty hall of the airport is full of would-be guides; you find one and, together you drive back into history. We drove south-west for more than an hour until we came to a huddle of houses called Sayaxche, a natural crossing point on the banks of the wide, brown Rio Pasión, where there was a collection of amazingly long canoes with thatched roofs. We took one out on to the river and headed deep into David Attenborough country - crocodiles bellyflopping off the banks, hummingbirds and kingfishers and toucans sweeping across the water and, on each side, the immense confusion of greenery tumbling down to the river's edge. Every so often, we passed groups of thatched houses in clearings or saw fishermen feeding lines into the water. Then we came to Ceibal. Walking into the jungle was only slightly alarming. You watch your feet for snakes on the path and you need to be warned that in the trees, there are howler monkeys who assert themselves by imitating the roar of jaguars, a really blood-chilling sound but harmless. There are tarantulas who nest in holes in the ground but they refuse to come out, even when your guide pokes a stick in to try to prove that the spiders will sit on your shoulder without biting. Mostly, the whole place is deeply exciting and it is the fact that every inch of it is slithering with life that makes it so striking and, just as you have absorbed all this, you realise you are in the middle of a ghost city. Here, in a clearing, is a circular pyramid, grey stone steps leading to a flat platform. It has sat here for a thousand years; at one point, it was completely overwhelmed by vegetation; and yet the edges of the stonework are still sharp, the surface of the platform is still intact. And here, in another, much bigger clearing is a larger, rectangular pyramid and at its feet, like a row of stone doors, there stands a collection of stelae. They are flat sheets of rock, each of them carved with hieroglyphs and with the image of a man, and each of these men is different in clothing and attitude and, most of all, in facial appearance. These are real images of the past, standing alone in the middle of this jungle, snapshots of the lost kings who once ruled central America. Now, the mysteries begin to unfold. Where did these people come from? There are Guatemalans who will tell you they came from Israel or Atlantis or even Venus, but their facial appearance, their languages - which are built out of single syllables with multiple tones - and, most striking, their continuing habit of bowing from the waist in greeting or gratitude all suggest they are migrants from somewhere much nearer China. They were sophisticated people. In so far as the hieroglyphs and the stelae have been decoded, they reveal a people who were tracking the stars and measuring time and developing art and mathematics while the Romans were still emerging from the swamp. T here was also a cruelty to them. The stelae tell of wars, of the capture and slaughter of prisoners and of the public sacrifice of enemies, sometimes by decapitation, sometimes by the slicing removal of a beating heart. In the bushes in Ceibal, there is a mound of soil and root that has grown over an ancient ball court, where - if the decoding of hieroglyphs is to be believed - Mayan kings played a game slightly like basketball against their vanquished enemies before handing them over to the priests to be pitched into their journey through the underworld. The more you peer through the vegetation, the more of these mounds you see - palaces, temples, pyramids, water reservoirs, more stelae lying drunkenly in the undergrowth, the remains of a city that once housed some 10,000 people. Where did they go? Why - 500 years before the Spanish arrived - did they suddenly abandon the city? And all this is nothing compared with the ruins of Tikal, several hours to the north. When you first come through the tall trees at Tikal and you see in front of you the Temple of the Great Jaguar, climbing up towards the sky, layer upon layer of stonework, crowned with the statue of a seated man with a serpent upon a throne, and when you reach into your imagination and restore the bright red and green and cream paint with which it was once decorated and you conjure up the crowd of Mayan men and women, milling down below, and you hear the sound of their excitement as the priest steps out on to the platform at the dizzy peak of the pyramid to begin the ritual that will grant them power and favour, you know you are gazing up at the architecture of pure power. It belittles everyone beneath it. And then you turn and you see, several hundred yards away to the west, the Temple of the Masks, soaring to an equal height and, in between them, to the north, the two-and-a-half-acre acropolis of temples and burial chambers and then, to the south, the maze of palaces, linked by a burrow of passages, and you know you are looking at the hub of an awesome empire. It began to grow some 3,000 years before the birth of Christ and spread eventually across a vast acreage of territory, into what is now El Salvador and Honduras and southern Mexico. It rose and ruled and then collapsed 500 years before any European ever set eyes on it. And no one knows why. The archaeologists can date its demise to the end of the 9th century AD, by dating the fragments of pots they find in the ruins. Simply, there are none after that. Perhaps the city was hit by an earthquake or the fall-out from a volcano, but there is no geological sign of that. Perhaps there was some kind of rebellion and the power-elite were slaughtered. But why would the successful rebels then abandon the city they had won? Perhaps, the Mayan kings were the first power to succumb to a rebellion by their own environment; some believe they tore up too much of the rain forest, that the topsoil blew away and slipped into their water reservoirs, hurling them into starvation and drought. It is clear that they lost everything. When Tikal and Ceibal and the other cities were abandoned, the Mayans scattered across central America and, although they survived, they never again built such vast monuments. Their beliefs flowed underground, bubbling up in the rituals of the shamans, on the walls and altars of the Roman Catholic churches where their own religious images have crept in among the madonnas and the crosses, and in the dim-lit home of Maximon, where, beneath the bizarre addition of rum and cigarettes, supplicants are using ritual that was born thousands of years ago in a kingdom in a jungle that continues to conceal a mass of mysteries.

Within minutes the sails were all up - 400sq m of brilliant white tarpaulin that caught first the sunlight then the wind. Jibs were secured, knots were tied, loose crockery was put away, drinks were finished and then suddenly, as if rousing herself from a deep sleep, the Grandi I gave one last lazy pitch forward - and took off across the waves. This was the fifth day of our week-long cruise around the Turquoise Coast, the sun-baked southwestern shores of Turkey that once housed the ancient independent kingdom of Lycia, and it wasn't the first time Captain Umit had raised the sails. But we'd never had a wind as fast as this. The Grandi I - a sleek, 29m, 100-ton yacht - swayed from side to side like a drunk as she ploughed through the waves at an exhilarating 10 knots, turning passengers into human pinballs as we tried to serve ourselves lunch or raced to nab the best seat in the house: the bowsprit, or beam overhanging the front, where every movement of the boat was magnified, every spray-lashed second breathtaking. I was one of nine passengers who had come aboard the Grandi I, one of a fleet of seven yachts, at a quiet cove near Marmaris, a large developed resort whose intricate, bazaar-strewn backstreets have been all but eclipsed by the sprawl of concrete. After dumping our bags in the mahogany-lined cabins belowships, it was shoes and socks off and up on to the aftdeck for champagne with the captain, who spread out a well-worn map of the waters we would be navigating, and the ports we would visit. Spending a week in a confined space with a handful of strangers might be some people's idea of hell. Cynics may find it hard to believe but Tussock, the people who organise these cruises, insist their groups always get along, as they take great care in ensuring a good mix: singles, couples, whatever, whoever, so long as they're likely to gel. They even take pop stars, and have performed weddings at sea. Our group, a not-exactly-shy bunch of twenty-, thirty- and fortysomethings, seemed to hit it off right away; but maybe it's not that hard to break the ice when the needle's nearing 90, the cooler's crammed with booze, everyone's on holiday, the Med's your oyster and there's a daily excursion to look forward to. Despite the occasional burst of speed with the sails hoisted, mornings and early afternoons were mostly given over to taking it easy. We'd rise whenever we wanted, tease whoever had overdone it the most the previous night, help each other smear on the factor 16, then ooh and aah over what new treat Selahattin, our cook, had prepared for breakfast. One day it was chopped apple in light yogurt, another day banana slices doused with dark honey still dripping from the comb - always fresh, always delicious, always different and always served up with feta cheese, eggs, olives, nuts, sliced tomatoes and Turkish coffee so thick you could barely get the spoon in. No one, we were told, loses weight on these cruises, despite the fact that the moment the Grandi I dropped anchor anywhere we'd cool off with a plunge into the clear blue waters, and the crew would look out the ship's canoeing, windsurfing and snorkelling equipment for us to go up and down quiet coves making noisy nuisances of ourselves. Selahattin used to be a fisherman, in the days when these waters still had plenty of fish. But now, as we discovered on a shopping excursion to Fethiye, tourists are the main catch. \"My friend, my friend,\" we heard constantly as we strolled past the bars, cafés, restaurants, carpet stores and sweet shops that make up this pleasant town. \"Come in, yes please. Where you from?\" I stopped off at a simple store for a box of Turkish delight - not the jellied variety dusted with sugar, but the rolls of curled-over candy steeped in rose water and dotted with pistachio nuts that come in flavours like banana, fig or chocolate, and have to be snipped into slices with scissors. \"Glasgow?\" said the shopkeeper when I told him where I was from. \"See you, Jimmy!\" he growled, then named some pubs in the city centre before pulling a cross-eyed face and saying: \"Get oot ma road ya wee bampot!\" If it was a gimmick, it was a pretty good one and, before I knew it, I was sitting on a chair in the middle of the shop, drinking apple tea and being introduced to his family. Fifteen minutes later, I left laden with four boxes of Turkish delight, five pots of crushed-nut honey, a cup with the tail of a fish for a handle, a bright blue-and-yellow ashtray, a stone turtle, and a huge, elaborately hand-painted plate. He named a price and I paid it, lacking the strength and the nous to haggle, as is expected. It was still early evening when I headed back to the boat, but over my shoulder I could see him excitably shutting up shop, possibly for the rest of the month. Our first big excursion had, by contrast, been to ancient ruins in Letoon and Xanthos, the heartland of ancient Lycia. Situated near the southern port of Kas, both sites are a great introduction to the rich history that ancient Lycia and its environs boast (despite the fact that much of what was uncovered here in the 1800s was plundered for Britain). For thousands of years, these Turkish shores were the stage for invading armies and ancient civilisations: Luwians, Hurians, Ionians, Trojans, Carians, Lycians and Persians. In 540BC, the people of Xanthos, finding their city surrounded by Persian troops, gathered up all their belongings and formed them into a giant funeral pyre. The women and children died in the flames, the men perished fighting. Only eight families, who had been away, survived. Then in 42BC, during the Roman civil war, Brutus besieged Xanthos and the citizens put their city to the torch all over again. My favourite character, however, was the Persian King Xerxes, who had plenty of style but little luck. In 479BC, he followed the progress of his army at the sea battle of Salamis from a throne of gold placed on a hilltop. His forces were four times more powerful than their Greek opponents but still he watched helpless as his ships sank one by one. \"My men have fought as women,\" he said, \"and my women have fought as men.\" Then, half a century later, there was King Mausoleus who, to keep power in his family, married his sister, Artemisia II. And so happy was she in this union that, every day after his death, she drank a glass of wine containing a sprinkling of his ashes. The daily excursions are all voluntary but there was one trip everyone signed up for: the hamam, or Turkish bath. Off we went, towels round our middles, legs like lava lamps thanks to badly applied suncream, each emerging into the humidity of the rounded marble bath chamber. At the centre of the hamam is the naval stone, a raised platform heated from below. On this we lay, as a masseur scrubbed us up and down with a kese (abrasive mitt), sloshed us with hot water, then produced a large white cotton bag into which he popped six bars of soap. This was dipped in warm water, blown into, then held tightly shut and pushed down over whoever was on the slab, causing an explosion of lather that was then massaged in. Just as I was getting the treatment, a Turkish bloke in the corner began a chant so low and penetrating it seemed to come from the marble itself. As the tiny bubbles of lather popped in my ears, it felt like I was drifting off on a magic carpet. We had eaten ashore the day before, at an attractive little port called Kalkan, taking the biggest table in a seafood restaurant overlooking the white walls of the harbour reddenning in the twilight. But, after the hamam, we ate back onboard the Grandi I, skin still tingling as Selahattin fried up the sea bream we'd seen him descaling that afternoon, and served it with the usual 1001 delicacies - cous cous, bulgur wheat, fried pancake rolls stuffed with cheese and parsley, goulash, carrot yogurt, artichokes with garlic - dishes that were probably as mundane and everyday to him as a cheese-and-pickle sandwich is to us. But we fell upon them and felt like royalty. In true Mediterranean fashion, it was over the food and drink that our group really came together. By day we'd split up into smaller groups; then, later, we'd reassemble around the long table on the aftdeck of the Grandi I, experiencing the richness of Turkey through the dishes before us. And, as the wine flowed and the captain put on Turkish music or let us play our own, we would open up to each other more and more. We had started the week as strangers. But now - after excursions up the labyrinthine Dalyan River to the tombs of the Lycian kings engraved in a cliff; after smearing ourselves in the skin-cleansing, grey-green mud from a warm sulphurous spring; after being tossed about in the waves at Patara Beach, one of the Med's longest; after sitting up talking, drinking and laughing around the dinner table till the small hours, then staggering off to sleep on the sundeck beneath the stars - we were as easy in each other's company as old friends. And beneath us, on that last night on the Turquoise Coast, was our other new friend - that giant timber cradle gently rocking us to sleep, the Grandi I.

(I'm surprised Alexei Sayle didn't call them contes and reel in the half-pun). One of them features Nic and Tob, a comedy double-act on television, whose 'arrival on the comedy scene had fortunately coincided with the rise of stupidity, the public having tired of being shouted at by fat men about things that weren't their fault as a form of light entertainment.' It's not long since Alexei Sayle was the fat git in a suit shouting at us about things. Not so much fat, I thought, as boundless comic energy buttoned in, and then squeezed out into a television series. In hardback, the tone is cooler, harder. Nic and Tob at the BBC Club bar overhear one top executive say to another: 'You know I've been thinking that maybe we should do more than pander to the lowest taste of the idiot public, chasing every will o' the wisp, voguish fad. Perhaps as a public broadcast organisation we should try to illuminate the world with a bright pure light of elevating joy.' (As it turned out, the man had been in the middle of a nervous breakdown and was soon fired, becoming an organic baker in Penrith.) Nic and Tob try to prevent this demented change of broadcasting policy by becoming voodoo priests and so manipulate the dead souls of the BBC Light Entertainment Department to their advantage. So that's the answer. I've often wondered how it's done. Many of the stories have punch lines. Most have the impersonality of a joke. In a joke a man goes into a pub. It's not a man called Peter, with ginger hair, a mole on his left cheek and carrying a folded copy of the Lymington Times, it's just a man about to run into a punch line. Or, quite often with Alexei Sayle, a stab line: 'The black man took him down an alley, handed over the drugs and then he and a friend tried to rob Barnaby. But Barnaby pulled out the knife he'd bought at the motorway place outside Madrid and cut them both across the face with two quick strokes, forehand and backhand, swick, swick. Swick, swick.' This is life looked at through the wrong end of a telescope, the vision of Nathaniel West in Miss Lonelyhearts and to my mind just as good. Alexei Sayle is right. We are clearly (the politician's favourite word) minuscule creatures scurrying round this shit-heap of a country looking for an incongruous end. Some Entertainment Department. Swick, swick. The finest story is 'Big-Headed Cartoon Animal'. A beautiful liberal couple take a holiday in California and are entranced to be surrounded in Hollywood by equally beautiful people. Towards the end of their stay they visit what Sayle coyly calls: 'The original theme park, the magic kingdom, supposedly the happiest place in the fucking world.' Here are the employees dressed as the big-headed cartoon animals, and here, Pete observes, are all the ugly folks they'd kept out of Hollywood. While his wife enjoys the rides, Pete becomes obsessed with the cleanliness of the park, the absence of rubbish. He examines a rubbish bin and finds a small catch which allows him to hinge back the bin, revealing a circular shaft, its walls lined with the slime of a trillion junk meals dropping perhaps 50 feet into Stygian darkness. Pete gets bumped by one of the uglies, falls down the shaft and enters an appalling world of rubbish conveyed on belts and locomotives by Hispanic slaves, towards huge furnaces which, in turn, power the rides above. Here, Pete is picked up by security guards, interrogated and punished. Something heavy and foam-lined is slipped over his head: 'Some sort of helmet, he thought, with two tiny eye-holes to look out of. Next, a one-piece suit was put on his struggling form, then boots on his feet and his hands jammed into large heavy gloves.' Back on the surface, Pete rushes to embrace his wife. 'All she saw was the big-headed cartoon animal that looked like a dog, but wasn't a dog, waving its paddles at her and all she heard was a distant mumbling from deep inside its big silly cartoon head'. Talk about an inner voice... inside every fat git there's a poet trying to get out. Well, he's out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/24/lordreform.constitution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-24T18:41:20Z","webTitle":"Lord Wakeham online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/24/lordreform.constitution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/24/lordreform.constitution","fields":{"headline":"Lord Wakeham online","bodyText":"dfic1999 With reference to the defeat of the 'Mode of Trial' bill, Jack Straw's criticism of the undemocratic nature of the Lords looks ridiculous. The proposed reforms enshrine precisely that lack of accountability. An elected Lords could still be overruled, so why have the Wakeham/Blair stitch-up? Lord Wakeham First, our report is certainly not a stitch-up between me and the prime minister. I chaired an independent commission with representatives from each of the main parties and other independent people with relevant experience. We sought to answer three questions. First, what is the second chamber for? What roles and functions should it carry out? Second, what sort of people do you need in order to enable the second chamber to carry out those tasks effectively? And third, how do you go about getting such people? You need to think about the consequences of having a chamber which was accountable to the electorate in the same way as the House of Commons is. Elections can in practice only be won by people with the backing of party machines; an elected second chamber's members will turn out to be the same kind of professional politicians that you see in the Commons. That wouldn't add value to the parliamentary process. That's why we recommend a house with a range of different sources of authority. Its authority will come from the quality of its arguments, the distinction of its members, the breadth of experience and expertise they can bring to bear and the fact that - unlike the Commons - the house will be broadly representative of the whole of British society. As to the suggestion that an elected Lords could still be overruled by the Parliament Act, the reality is that it would be very difficult to justify a situation in which one elected House of Parliament had to give way to another elected house. An elected House of Lords would have the same source of democratic authority as the Commons and that would be a recipe for damaging constitutional conflict. If the electorate votes in a general election to choose a government, that government has a mandate to carry out its policies. Sure, the second chamber should be able to force the government and the Commons to think again and to present a reasoned case for altering legislative proposals if they haven't been thought through properly. But the House of Commons should be the country's decisive political forum. Mossop So instead of having representation by \"... just another bunch of professional politicians\" it's much better to have representation by a bunch of politicians' unelectable mates. This is authoritarian nonsense and a disgraceful display of contempt towards the electorate. Lord Wakeham This comment seems to me to miss the point that under our proposals the new members of the second chamber would be appointed by a totally independent Appointments Commission. Our report envisages an end to prime ministerial control of the size, party balance and individual membership of the second chamber and an end to political patronage. The independence of the Appointments Commission would be guaranteed by statute and its members would be appointed on a basis which had all-party support and couldn't be controlled by the government. simon44 What if you were to extend your proposal of upper house MPs being elected every 15 years for a single term to the entire upper house? That would reduce the hold of party whips. Furthermore, if it was done on a PR voting system (as I believe you propose) the chances of one party having a majority would be remote. Lord Wakeham The report makes clear that a majority of the members of the commission had a preference for using 'partially open' list PR to elect regional members of the second chamber. This would give electors the opportunity to vote for individual candidates or for party lists. But if the elections are to be held on the same day as elections to the European parliament, it seemed sensible to suggest that the same system should be used for both elections in order to avoid confusing the electors. I very much take the point about the need to ensure the independence of members of the reformed House of Lords. If individuals have to compete directly in elections, there is an even greater chance that they will be people who are committed to the parties concerned, bound by party manifesto commitments and dependent on their party for re-nomination, re-election or preferment. The use of a list system of PR would reduce the need for personal electioneering. But our proposals go further in ensuring the independence of members of the second chamber by giving them long terms of office and providing that regional members can only have one term. If they are doing a good job and want to carry on the Appointments Commission could reappoint them to the second chamber once their initial term of office had ended. wh52 There are very many people who have much to contribute to the way society is run, or have great experience in the workings of organisations that governments seek to control, eg experienced teachers, doctors, probation officers. There are also forms of local leadership outside mainstream politics such as tenants' groups, Citizen Advice Bureau organisers, Samaritans' volunteers who can input on the real impact of government decisions. These skills do not co-exist well with the rather self-centred political skills of running for office. Did you consider how to bring these skills into government, without requiring ministerial patronage? Lord Wakeham This is very much in line with what we have recommended in the report. We accept that the kind of skills and experience which people in a range of vocational or voluntary organisations may have are very different from the self-centred political skills of running for office. An independent Appointments Commission's remit would be to bring in people representative of a whole variety of different sectors of society - vocational, professional, cultural, sporting and so on. That will give a second chamber with a range of experience and expertise which is greater than that of the House of Commons so that it is able to bring different perspectives to bear. patrickford The proposals are very disappointing and undemocratic; I voted Labour for a radical change. The number of proposed members is too high; there should be a maximum of 400 of whom 300 should be directly elected with the power to co-opt up to 100 other members for a fixed term subject to an independent appointments commission. Membership should be subject to similar conditions to those for the US Senate: not less than 30 years of age; British citizen for at least 9 years; resident in the area for which chosen. I suggest that the new assembly could be called the Moot or the Witanmoot reflecting the historical roots of our democracy. Lord Wakeham We want quite a lot of the members to be part-time members so they would have the chance to carry on with their business or professional lives or whatever, and come along to the Lords when there was a subject about which they felt deeply, or where they had a special contribution to make. I would rather have two or three active vice-chancellors in the Lords who could bring some real current knowledge to bear on debates than have one who would have to stop being a vice-chancellor in order to spend the time there. CAnselin How much power do you feel, personally, upper chambers should possess? Are you saying that genuine bicameral democracies, such as the US and Australia, are inferior to the British system of an \"elective dictatorship\", where the government dominates the Commons AND the Lords? Lord Wakeham The House of Lords' problem has not been its lack of powers but its lack of confidence and authority to use its powers. I think this country needs a moderately powerful second chamber with the confidence and authority to force the government or the Commons to think again and either justify or amend its proposals. We believe parliament should continue to be bicameral and that it should become impossible for the government to dominate the Lords as well as the Commons. Equally, no opposition party should dominate the House of Lords. Our proposals would ensure that the Lords is not a compliant rubber stamp or a source of constitutional gridlock. PC49 I understand that the Commission want the new chamber to be \"broadly representative of the whole of British society\". In opinion polls over recent years a significant minority of the British public have supported the abolition of the monarchy and around one third have stated that they have no belief in any god. Is it your view, therefore, that the new chamber should include appointees who are professed republicans or atheists? Lord Wakeham I would be happy to see the whole spectrum of views held by members of British society reflected in the membership of the second chamber. njrq As one who gave evidence to the commission in Edinburgh advocating a fully elected upper house, I am naturally disappointed that the commission has not followed this route. But I am also perplexed: what is the point of electing a small proportion of the house? This seems to me to have about as much logic as resolving a custody dispute by cutting the child down the middle (or in the case of your proposed proportions, splitting off 11%, 16% or 35% of said child). I would have thought that most democrats would share the view that a mostly unelected house is undemocratic, and be little happier with this than with a fully non-elected house. Lord Wakeham Our basic overall conclusion is that the chamber should be primarily appointed but that a significant minority of members should be 'regional members' who would be a voice for the nations and regions of the UK. The precise proportion is not crucial and indeed we put forward a range of models for consideration. The point is that a central Appointments Commission would not be very good at identifying the right people to speak for each of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, alongside all the other people who will be there speaking for other sectors of society; someone selected for the North East by a London-based Appointments Commission would be no substitute for someone selected locally. jeffery99 The profound shifts in economic and political power that have taken place over the last decade - from national governments to unelected and unaccountable institutions, such as the WTO, or powerful transitional companies - means that there is very little public scrutiny over many of the forces that directly shape peoples lives. The Commons is clearly too obsessed with domestic issues and short term political advantage to play this role. Therefore, you and your colleagues should have taken this opportunity to present radical proposals to ensure that the second chamber was given the role of seeking to scrutinise and hold greater accountability over the supranational institutions and companies that preside over the process of globalisation as well as to improve the understanding of the connections between important global issues, such as poverty or the global environment, and the implications for the UK electorate. The failure to address this governance gap holds potentially profound implications for democracy. Lord Wakeham You make an interesting point but it goes beyond the terms of reference of the royal commission. Even parliament as a whole can only really be accountable for matters within its jurisdiction. nealbrown Has your commission considered the model of the jury in your proposals? Some proportion of a second chamber could selected from the public on a similar basis as jurors are for trial by jury. Public representation would by definition be increased, using a system generally very well respected and considered fair. The apparent arbitrariness of such selection would in fact be a virtue, implying the possibility of a more disinterested participation. Lord Wakeham This was amongst the proposals which were put to us. It has the same kind of disadvantages as for random selection generally. You might get a cross-section of society but you wouldn't necessarily get people with the relevant skills and experience who would, collectively, have sufficient authority to act as a restraining influence on the government. rosslare Given the appallingly low turnout in recent elections, why have you thought it appropriate to introduce a second chamber that is not directly accountable - surely this will further disillusion the electorate. Lord Wakeham I would put the point the other way round. Given that voters are expected to vote in local government elections, general elections, European elections and, in some areas, in elections for regional parliaments, and in referendums, the introduction of yet another round of elections could well have turned the electorate off even more successfully. simon44 If a third of the house were elected every five years, then the Commons would always have a more recent mandate than at least two thirds of the upper house, which would stop the upper house having a greater authority. Lord Wakeham Long terms would certainly reduce the hold of the party whips, especially if, as we propose, members couldn't be re-elected; but the problem is that you wouldn't get a house which was broadly representative of British society and you would be unlikely to get people with the kind of knowledge, skills and range of expertise which we think the second chamber should have if it is carry out its tasks effectively. ajkent If an elected second chamber is unacceptable to the government, it would be better if they abolished it altogether. Cheaper, too. There should be a second chamber, with the current or very slightly increased powers, elected by PR. It would be more representative than the Commons and better able to limit excesses than currently when its credibility is impaired by the appointment process. The Commons should remain first-past-the-post, an electoral system better capable of producing strong governments. Lord Wakeham The point of having a second chamber made up in the way we propose is that it will be able to bring a far wider range of experience and expertise to bear on the consideration of proposed legislation and in scrutinising the government, and it will provide a voice in parliament for all sorts of different sectors of society - the nations and regions, minority ethnic groups, vocational, cultural, sporting and other walks of life. Such a chamber would have the authority which comes from being broadly representative of the society it seeks to serve but not the full democratic authority which is properly the preserve of the House of Commons. mthacker2 The majority of the population will have access to the internet in the lifetime of the next parliament. We simply no longer need representation at all. I can represent myself using modern technology to vote. I can ask parliamentary questions via e-mail. I can publish agendas, white papers, Hansard and I can table amendments via bulletin boards. I can debate issues using chat rooms. And I can vote on any topic at any time using simple replies to preformatted e-mails. This process supersedes party politics entirely and there is no further need for proportional representation, or first past the post, or an elected, or an unelected House of Lords. Even with the current levels of internet access it is significantly more democratic to allow these people to vote rather than the House of Lords. I am interested in why the royal commission dismissed this option? Lord Wakeham I think I would like to distinguish between the medium and the message. The distinctive feature of being a practising politician is having the skill to articulate people's views and work out practical solutions to the various problems which society faces. Even if everyone was connected to the internet the result would only be to accumulate people's differing views. It wouldn't help identify solutions. loesch I would be particularly interested to know whether the commission has given consideration to ensuring that the interests of children, and of future generations, are represented in the second house, and that human rights are not just considered in relation to the European legislation? Lord Wakeham Our report specifically makes the point that the second chamber should have a long-term perspective and thus be more likely to take into account the interest of future generations. One way in which we achieve this is by recommending that all members serve for relatively long terms. We recommend the establishment of a committee in the second chamber with a wide-ranging remit to consider the human rights aspects of all proposed legislation. brucehuk Why have you not taken the opportunity to recommend reform of the law lords to create something more akin to a supreme court, with greater transparency, a proper separation of the judiciary and the legislature, and a more open and representative form of appointment? Lord Wakeham We had to consider whether it was out of the question for the reformed Lords to continue to be the highest court of appeal in the country. On balance, we took the view that the present arrangements can continue pending a further dedicated inquiry. There are advantages in having the senior judiciary in the Lords where they are directly exposed to the thinking behind the formulation of legislation. garnerad What sort of people would you like to see selected by the independent commission for the new upper house? Would you like to see as many ex-MPs as there are now? Lord Wakeham As a group they should be authoritative, confident, broadly representative with a breadth of experience outside the world of politics and a broad range of expertise. They should have particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional matters and human rights and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective to bear. They should be free of domination by political parties. gbest Why do you think an independent commission would be better at selecting specialists or people from a cross section of British society than the electorate at large? Lord Wakeham The hard fact is that elections do not tend to produce either relevant specialists or people who are a representative cross section of British society. Increasingly, members of the Commons are drawn from a relatively narrow group of people with a long-standing commitment to political activity. The House of Lords should enable a different range of experience to be brought to bear. rohanis Might a partly elected, partly appointed house become a two-tier one where elected members are considered to have more \"legitimacy\" than appointees? Also, do you consider it probable that a degree of apathy may attend elections to the second house? Lord Wakeham We were very concerned to limit the risk of a two-tier membership. Under our recommendations all members would be formally appointed by the Appointments Commission, even those chosen by the regional electorates. They would serve for terms of about the same length and they would all have the same terms and conditions. Both regional members and directly appointed members will be distributed between the parties on a proportional basis. The problem with the Lords until now is that hereditaries tended to be drawn predominantly from one party. Such a situation would not arise under our recommendations. Mossop The appointees are very likely to come from the ranks of failed politicians, those who the electorate have rejected but that the parties wish to keep. As you admit the commission will be controlled by political parties. So all we as a people end up with is the career politicians we couldn't be persuaded to vote for in the first place. I find it humiliating that this is what we're being offered. Lord Wakeham I certainly do not accept that the Appointments Commission will be controlled by the political parties. It will be totally independent. This has been an interesting experience. I am glad to have had the opportunity to participate. I welcome the interest which you have all showed in the important issues covered by our report. I hope I have been able to explain a little more of the thinking behind our recommendations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/jan/26/tvandradio.television2","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-26T02:23:20Z","webTitle":"A very peculiar practice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/26/tvandradio.television2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/26/tvandradio.television2","fields":{"headline":"A very peculiar practice","bodyText":"Vets In The Wild (BBC1) came out the traps like Vic and Bob doing Out Of Africa. Trude Mostoe, Michaela Strachan without the training, led a wagon train across the Kenyan plain, in search of animals to castrate. Aided by Steve, her hunky fellow-vet, and \"Bimby Dyer\" - Meryl Streep playing Karen Blixen, but with the accent from Plenty, their plan was simple: to emasculate every creature in the animal kingdom before sunset. \"I do lots of carrrstrating for the area\", Bimby confessed, as they bumped across the plain, in search of their first quarry. \"Horses, ponies, camels, zebras. I once carrrstrated a cat following telephone instructions from my brother in Penzance.\" Bimby - it transpired - wasn't a vet at all, but loved getting her scalpel out and interfering with wild animals. Conversation was interrupted by arrival in the Castration Zone. Trude, who looked worried whenever she was called upon to do anything at all, turned grey as Inderobo Tribe members, who had gathered specially to see the BBC vets make fools of themselves, presented her with a testosterone-fuelled camel. \"Trudy, he won't hurt you\", Bimby lied, the animal pawing the ground and spitting for Kenya, \"he's as gentle as lambs.\" But the camel wasn't as gentle as lambs, fighting with every last breath to save his manhood. Itchy-fingered, Bimby could stand it no longer, stepping in with her trusty knife to save both Trude and the camel from a fate worse than death. \"I've only ever read about camels\", Trude said, by way of apology. Intentionally or not, Vets In The Wild humbled its star double act by showing them up to be little more than tourists on safari. \"You've got a great place here\", Trude said to a tribesman, gesturing to the Kenyan plain. \"It's lovely!

As with most half-hearted criminals, these men seemed far less concerned with carrying out a successful crime than with engineering a way in which they could be caught. \"I suppose I wanted to be caught,\" mused Terry, the art forger and very possible fake himself, \"because that's when Tom Keating got his recognition.\" Motivated more by vanity and class war than a desire to make money, Terry relished his work as a chance to get one over on the toffs. \"It's the thrill of the sting, of making experts - with their plum in mouth attitude - talk bull.\" Using a combination of staining the canvas in PG Tips and rubbing Nescafé granules into the pigment, Terry could knock off a Gaugin in the time it took to watch Antiques Roadshow (on which some of his best work had appeared). When Plod finally called, Terry was ready with his tea and coffee. Waiting in his cells, he knocked off a couple more fakes while waiting to be charged. Darius Guppy - rich, handsome, not very bright - is the kind of man Terry would have relished selling a Gaugin to. Befitting the confidence of his class, Guppy went for a multi-million pound insurance scam involving diamonds, a stick-up in a New York hotel with an old school chum, and more bad acting than his mother had experienced in 10 years of school plays. The NYPD took four sec onds at the scene to deduce it was a set-up. They had to stop themselves from laughing, as Guppy held his head in his hands and wailed \"The diamonds! The diamonds!\" For a joke, the police filed the claim to Lloyds Of London, who told them that Guppy was from \"a good family\" and that they would, therefore, pay up immediately. Oh no you won't, said the police. It was lucky none of the prosecuting officers had been to school with Guppy. Grange Hill (BBC1) returned with its usual cast of 45-year-old teenagers and interminably dull plot-lines about who stole my pencil case. For this series, the school appears to have had a makeover - all African carvings on plinths and Elle Deco glass tiles - and now employs an aromatherapist-cum-counsellor. Even the pupils communicate in Blair-speak, though at least some things never change: there's still a randy Welsh gym instructor trying to get his leg over the supply teacher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/26/labour.labour1997to99","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-26T02:23:22Z","webTitle":"Out of the red","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/26/labour.labour1997to99","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/26/labour.labour1997to99","fields":{"headline":"Out of the red","bodyText":"Gordon Brown has spent the past two and a half years talking about the importance of prudence and stability in public finance. By squeezing budgets throughout Whitehall and implementing stealthy tax rises in Labour's first two years, he succeeded in putting the public finances into the black for the first time in nearly a decade. He was expecting to stash a healthy £3bn away in his piggybank next year (that is to say, use it to pay off government debt) - but Tony Blair has now commandeered it for the health service. As well as staging a smash and grab raid on Brown's surplus, his neighbour's move has also blown a hole in spending plans. When Labour came to power, the chancellor abolished the regular bunfight over spending where ministers used to vie with each other to grab a larger share of the government's £350bn annual budget. Instead of planning spending year by year, the government now plans its spending in three-year chunks. The first comprehensive spending review (CSR), covered the financial years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. It was announced in July 1998. The next one, labelled Spending Review 2000, will cover the period from April 2001 to March 2004 (the first year of the new plan is the last year of the old). It is due to be announced this summer. But treasury officials were forced to go back to their drawing boards this week. While large increases for education and health were almost certain to have been a feature of the next spending round, the size of the boost to the NHS required to fund the PM's pledge has caused consternation. An influential estimate of how much room the government has for manoeuvre will be made today in the Institute for Fiscal Studies' annual anticipation of the chancellor's options. The prime minister's impromptu pledge also throws into doubt the proposition that politics can be taken out of budget planning - which is what the chancellor hoped when he designed the CSR process. Alongside the introduction of commercial or \"resource\" accounting, Brown hoped the CSR would rationalise spending discussions and improve long-term planning. The blueprint was written in New Zealand in the 80s, when its right-of-centre Labour party redesigned the relationship between treasury and spending departments. Accrual or resource accounting replaced cash accounting, enabling the treasury to measure the full costs of government activities. Next departments were encouraged to match spending to objectives. The treasury shifted its attention away from the traditional focus on inputs - how much each department gets each year - to outputs or what the state gets for its money. Instead of giving a department a budget and letting it go away and do pretty much what it likes with it, the treasury began specifying the outputs it expected in return. In New Zealand, the language of public sector management has become so commercialised that the treasury speaks of \"purchasing\" goods and services from department - for example, among the annual outputs it buys are firearms licensing services from the police, administration of benefit payments from the department of social welfare, even policy advice. The approach is being borrowed by the United Kingdom, along with a large number of former New Zealand treasury officials. This year's CSR will bring in resource accounting, be based on outputs not inputs and will tie departments to implementing their public service agreements (PSAs), statements of aims agreed in advance with the treasury. According to one of our treasury people, the focus has become: \"What does the money buy?\" Around Whitehall, departments are drafting their new PSAs and providing the treasury with the analytical information which will form the basis of discussions over the next few weeks. Each spending minister will appear in front of the cabinet committee on public expenditure, chaired by the chancellor, and be asked to justify themselves. Yet the political reality is rather different from the treasury rhetoric. This CSR is taking place as the Labour party starts its advance planning for the next election, which is likely to be held in the summer of 2001 (advance planning in fact began on May 2 1997). Labour will want to reward its supporters for their patience over the state of public services during the first two lean years of the parliament. The public has shown this winter that it will not tolerate the NHS being run any further into the ground. The name of the game is that in July Gordon Brown is able to get up and boast of how much is going into Labour's priority areas of health and education. Individual spending ministers go back to their departments to put together a wish list of what they want, which will be turned into a drip feed of good news stories for the government over the following 12 months. All of this has nothing to do with inputs, outputs, outcomes and resource accounting. In output terms, it is unlikely the government will purchase very much more \"health\", whatever the boost to NHS spending. Instead what it will be buying is the end of mixed wards, more choice for patients about when they can have their operations, and no more overflowing hospitals when the next flu \"epidemic\" strikes. All of which is perfectly worthy and is manifestly what the public wants. And what the public wants, the public gets from Labour, especially in an election year. • Charlotte Denny is the Guardian's economics reporter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jan/26/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-26T02:23:23Z","webTitle":"Belgium moves to halt Pinochet flight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/26/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/26/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"Belgium moves to halt Pinochet flight","bodyText":"Belgium was last night poised to ask the international court of justice to order Britain to halt any moves to return Augusto Pinochet to Chile. Georges-Henri Beauthier, lawyer for six Chileans living in Belgium, said a decision by the cabinet was imminent after the foreign minister, Louis Michel, said he was determined that Pinochet should not walk free. The necessary papers had already been sent to the Belgian embassy in the Hague, seat of the ICJ. \"Everything has been done at the legal level, but the political decision still needs to be taken,\" Mr Beauthier said. In the Netherlands, an ICJ spokesperson said no request had yet been made by the Brussels government, but a hearing could be held as soon as Friday if an application was filed formally today. At the high court in London today, the Belgian government and six human rights groups will seek a judicial review of Jack Straw's announcement that he was \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against the general on health grounds. Belgium, one of four countries seeking to extradite the former dictator, has entered the legal fray after it failed to get a reply from two requests to the home office for a new medical examination and access to the Pinochet files. The ICJ case will argue that Mr Straw is in breach of international cooperation agreements because he failed to allow other states involved in the case access to Pinochet's medical reports, or to conduct their own independent medical tests of the 84-year-old general. The case will also include an application for provisional measures to ensure the home secretary takes no steps to allow Pinochet to return to Chile while the matter is before the British courts. In the wake of the Belgian move to the Hague, the home office said: \"We take our international obligations very seriously, but the home secretary must comply with UK law and rulings in the UK courts.\" Belgium has stepped to the fore in international attempts to stop Pinochet returning to Chile, a move which was commented on with some surprise and even pride in newspapers yesterday. \"Belgium is a little rebel, daring to defy the still imperial, though now Blairite, United Kingdom,\" commented Le Soir. \"Now look who is raising the banner of justice in the face of reasons of state.\" Although no side would confirm it, it is understood the Spanish and Belgian lawyers and Amnesty International's legal team have been working closely over the past two weeks to ensure Pinochet does not flee Britain for Chile. In London, the parties seeking leave for judicial review today will argue the procedures followed by the home secretary have been unfair, particularly with regard to the non-disclosure of the medical evidence and a failure to allow independent tests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/jan/27/onlinesupplement6","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-27T02:47:58Z","webTitle":"Web watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/27/onlinesupplement6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/27/onlinesupplement6","fields":{"headline":"Web watch","bodyText":"Toy war A legal battle between the world's most successful toy e-tailer and seven members of an award-winning digital art collective has broken out over the domain name etoy.com. An appeal is underway in the Los Angeles Superior Court after a ruling that the arts group had infringed the toy company's trademark. eToys claimed that material posted on to the artists' site was of a subversive nature and used \"profane language\" which was damaging the company's brand and was potentially dangerous to minors who might stumble upon the site by mistake. However, the Swiss-based group, etoy, registered the domain name in October 1995, two years before the California-based toy company began trading. Since then it has established a reputation as one of the pioneers of internet-based art. The company has offered to buy out the group and an offer of $400,000 is believed to have been turned down. A number of cyber-liberties groups have leapt to the artists' defence, claiming that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent that could encourage companies to \"hijack\" financially desirable domain names. A number of web sites based around the ones at www.toywar.com are raising support for a fight in the US courts. Although the artists have been forced to take their site down, a mirror is at http://146.228.204.72:8080 Le Tube What a shame London Underground has yet to deliver its proposed online journey planner for its site at www.londontransport.co.uk/underground . The company has admitted that 70% of the site's visitors have asked for the service. London Underground is further shamed by the discovery that the website of the Paris Metro hosts an online journey planner - for London and in English. A point-and-click map of the London Underground can be found at http://metro.ratp.fr:10001/bin/statmap/english/united-kingdom/london. Most of the major stations come with additional local information (Swiss Cottage is linked to the Freud Museum, Camden Town to the Jazz Café). Average journey times are also given. The French site also contains online journey planners for 60 cities world wide - from Tyneside to Buenos Aires - all in English. Sounds good The rush to dominate the online music scene heated up last week with the news that current leaders EMusic.com had bought Cductive.com, one of the web's notable independents and a particular favourite of listeners to underground music styles. The acquisition means that a wider range of downloadable music will be available from a single site. Cductive was an early pioneer of online music sales and has become renowned for its huge catalogue of underground music, particularly dance. It represents more than 350 different labels and has a number of unsigned acts. EMusic, already the internet's leading seller of downloadable music, now hopes that the range of music from the most commercial to the most obscure will be enough to see off a wealth of rivals that now includes Warner EMI. Shooting the banners During the recent Guardian debate over the commercialisation of the net, ntk.net's editor Danny O'Brien complained that banner advertising was now taking longer to download than the actual content of most web pages. Users with local-dial up connections find this particularly frustrating, so finding a way to circumvent the bandwidth-eating ads could prove incredibly popular. While rumours of the existence of software that can avoid banner advertising has been around for as long as the ads themselves, a workable system has yet to materialise. Enter www.calltheshots.com, a site that claims to offer users the power to select different parts of web pages, avoid parts they don't want including the ads and to even mix and match different websites on the same page. Although available only as a beta version, calltheshots seems to work fairly smoothly - and could prove useful if applied to a handful of favourite sites. The interface does take some time to set up, and only works on a page-by-page basis. But it is possible to mix the BBC news ticker with share prices from ft.com. And the admen are taking it all very seriously. Last week the Internet Advertising Bureau said it was investigating the site and are looking at the possibility of legal action. Just give me the fax Fax4free is a new web-based service that does exactly what it says on the tin - sends faxes around the world for free. There is no special software to download and no extra charge to users who wish to \"broadcast\" a large number of faxes to different destinations. But it will not work if your computer won't accept cookies. Paying in kindness Feeding the world's hungry by shopping for clothes or CDs seems to be one of those too-good-to-be-fair things that the web keeps coming up with. But that is exactly what the people behind iPledge.net - an online charity mall - claim they are able to do. Each time users buy online, iPledge forwards a percentage of the sales price as a charitable contribution to the non-profit organisation of the users choice. Retail groups already signed up include Amazon.co.uk and online music store Blackstar, while the list of charities includes Ash and the British Liver Foundation. Note that the incredibly popular Hungersite.com, which pioneered this kind of thing, recently upped its cups of free food from one to three, per person, per day. Buzzing with ideas Abuzz.com is a new site that attempts to create a series of online micro-communities or \"circles\" built around various topics like technology or travel. Members are invited to pool information - a bit like the Guardian's very own Notes and Queries - by posting questions to one another. With average response times running at around six hours the system can quickly prove addictive - even if the responses often throw up as many questions as they attempted to answer. Browsing with the bad guys Any site that claims to be \"the internet's one stop emporium of world domination, evil-doing, and tampering with things beyond man's ken,\" needs bookmarking. The site at www.villains.co.uk includes features on how Y2K went wrong for the criminal fraternity and how to build an atom bomb then cheekily links itself to the websites of MI5 and the CIA. Laugh?

Today the population is 59.2m - the 18th largest in the world. However, it is an aging population: in 1901 one person in 20 was aged 65 or over but one in six by 1998. One in 15 of the population is from an ethnic minority. Families and household: we live in more houses and marry less The average household size halved in the last century: before 1900 the average size was 4.6 people but now it is 2.4. In fact, while the population grew by just under a half in the twentieth century the number of households tripled. Just under one in three of us now live alone. The popularity of marriage fell throughout the decades, and the 310,000 couples who married in 1996 were part of the smallest group ever. The proportion of non-married women aged 18 to 49 who were cohabiting more than doubled between 1979 and 1999 to 29%. Four in 10 births take place out of marriage. Expenditure: we spend more Total household expenditure more than tripled in real terms between 1951 and 1998. In 1998 around £5 per person was spent on eating out. Health: not so good In 1998-99, 20% of adults said they had a long standing illness compared to 15% in 1975 and around a quarter of men and women aged 16-24 were overweight or obese compared with three quarters of men aged 55 to 64 and two thirds of women the same age. Fresh fruit consumption is on the up: in 1998 the average person ate 700g of fresh fruit each week at home compared to 500g in 1975. Smoking was also down to 27% of the population compared to nearer 50% in the early 1970s. Life expectancy is 75 years for males and 80 years for females: in 1911 it was just 50 years for men and 54 years for women. Crime: more drugs, more men in prison There were seven times more drugs seizures in the United Kingdom in 1997 than 1981. In 1998, 95% of the prison population was male. Education and training: we're learning The number of school pupils rose from 4.7m in 1946/47 to 8.4m in 1975/76. The figure fell in the 1980s as the birth rate dropped but picked up in the 1990s though it is still below its 1970s peak. The proportion of 16-18 year olds in full time education rose from 35% in 1988 to 55% in 1998. In 1998, 54% of Indian pupils and 61% of \"other Asian\" pupils in England and Wales achieved five or more A-C GCSE grades compared to 47% of white pupils. The proportion of young women achieving two or more A levels has doubled since the mid-1970s to 25%. Labour market: less years but more hours In 1901 around 10% of 10-14 year old boys were in employment and 40% of men aged 75 or over were still working. Both these figures dropped but the proportion of working women rose to 72% in 1998, and in 1996-97 over three fifths of couples with dependent children had both parties in employment compared to around half in 1979/80. By 1998 the proportion of the labour force had more than doubled to 40% from the 18% desk bound in 1901. The numbers working in agriculture fell from 12% to 2% over the same period. In spring 1999, around 24% of female and 15% of male full-time employees worked some form of flexible working pattern. We also work the longest hours in Europe at 45.7 hours for men and 40.7 hours for women. Income and wealth: men still earning more Men's incomes outstripped those of women at all ages in 1996-97, with men earning nearly twice that of women in their late forties peak earning period. In the 1990s the growth in average earnings outpaced the growth in retail prices and the inequality in the distribution of household disposable incomes that grew so sharply in the 1980s receded in the last decade. Environment: it's getting hotter In 1996-97, 51% of adults said they had regularly taken paper to a paper bank for recycling. Globally, seven out of the 10 hottest years on records have been in the 1990s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jan/28/ethicalforeignpolicy.foreignpolicy2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-28T16:28:46Z","webTitle":"Diplomacy for democracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/28/ethicalforeignpolicy.foreignpolicy2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/28/ethicalforeignpolicy.foreignpolicy2","fields":{"headline":"Diplomacy for democracy","bodyText":"The global context We have just celebrated the advent of a new millennium. Some people contend that we celebrated one year early. But in foreign policy, we celebrated the new era ten years too late. Movements in geo-political forces do not arrange themselves around convenient points in the calendar. In international relations, the new century began in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down. The cold war had divided much of the world and most of its GDP into two hostile camps. Its sudden end has coincided with a revolution in communications technology which has united many of the same countries in one global economy. It was fashionable in the past decade to debate whether this century would be America's century, or Japan's century, or maybe even Europe's century. In reality, it is going to be the internationalist century. Economic growth is dominated by global trade which is expanding at triple the rate of output. The integration of financial markets is such that both investors and workers can find themselves ruined overnight because of upsets in banking systems on the far side of the globe. No national economy is now an island. The growth curve in communications is ultra-exponential. In the US, the world wide web has attracted 50 million users in four years: to do the same took television 13 years and radio 38. Access to information on the internet expands by a million pages every day. The extraordinary capacity of the new technology to communicate instantly, and cheaply, around the globe has produced the \"death of distance\" as the defining barrier between states and continents. It also makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to co-exist with modern economies. Even the most vigilant border guard is unable to challenge the mighty click of a mouse. It is a curiosity of semantics that the word 'internationalism' produces a favourable reaction, except on the wilder shores of reactionary isolationism. But the word \"globalisation\" generally provokes a wary, if not hostile, reaction. If you asked me whether I am in favour of globalisation, I would give broadly the same answer as Tom Friedman. My attitude to globalisation is much the same as my attitude to the dawn. On balance, I think it is a good thing that the sun rises every day. But I also know there is nothing I can do to stop it even if I wanted to. Similarly, the only rational response to globalisation is to pursue strategies that maximise benefits and minimise damage. Goals and principles What then is the foreign policy that helps deliver the benefits of globalisation and deflect its damage to Britain? The purpose of our foreign policy is to pursue our national interests. In broad terms, those national interests are the four objectives I set out in the mission statement for the foreign office in this parliament: • promoting prosperity through trade and the British economy; • ensuring the security of the United Kingdom; • enhancing the quality of life of people through global diplomacy on environment, the drugs trade and cross-border crime; and • building respect for our values by supporting human rights and freedom How the foreign office promotes those national interests requires us to understand the modern world, and produce a strategy that relates to the world as it will be in this new century, not as it was in the last. I propose four guiding principles that can help us shape a foreign policy for the internationalist century: • globalisation requires more bridges and fewer barriers; • the global interest is becoming the national interest; • the global community needs universal values; and • the stronger Britain's standing in our own continent, the greater the leverage we will have in the other six. Bridges not barriers For diplomacy the starting point must be that globalisation requires bridges and removes barriers. A policy of containment is a difficult strategy in the age of the fibre-optic cable, the jumbo jet and the satellite dish. There will always be the exception, such as the murderous regime in Iraq where the only safe strategy is to keep it in the isolation ward until it accepts the norms of international behaviour. Or the military dictatorship in Burma which has persistently failed to respond to dialogue. It takes two to critically engage. Critical engagement But as a general rule it is increasingly hard to bar the multiple doors that globalisation forces open. We have therefore adopted a conscious policy of critical engagement - the pursuit of political dialogue wherever it can produce benefits. This strategy of critical engagement has produced practical gains for British interests. For instance, with Argentina, we hosted a visit of reconciliation by former President Menem. We followed it up with an agreement that puts communications between Argentina and the Falklands on a secure basis. We are robustly committed to the long-standing policy that the Falkland Islands will be British so long as their residents wish it. But, the more we build confidence between ourselves and Argentina, the greater the security we can offer the islanders. Critical engagement in other cases may require involvement without illusions about the regimes with which we negotiate. With Libya, we have secured the handover of the two Lockerbie suspects and compensation for the killing of WPC Fletcher. We have returned a British ambassador to Tripoli after fifteen years, enhancing our capacity to promote British interests there and to register our concerns. With Iran, we have obtained a commitment from the government that they will not carry out the fatwa nor help others to do so. Once again, we have an ambassador in Tehran. That does not mean we have stopped having concerns about a number of policies of Iran, nor that we have stopped expressing them frankly. But it must be right to respond to the growing popular demands within Iran for modernisation and moderation. With Cuba, I have had the first formal meeting with a Cuban foreign minister since the Castro revolution forty years ago. We retain deep concerns about human rights in Cuba. But we are more likely to make progress if Cuba is more open to the world, and the world more open to Cuba. Such dialogues can be uncomfortable to those who believe we best preserve the purity of our commitment to human rights by refusing to talk to the very regimes that need to hear our message. Such a policy may leave us with clean hands. But is unlikely to provide their people with better rights. Dialogue of civilisations One strength that Britain brings to the task of bridge-building is that modern Britain is a multi-faith, multi-cultural society. Here in London some 200 different languages are spoken. We must use this rich cultural advantage and experience of tolerance to promote tolerance abroad. Globalisation foreshortens the landscape of diplomacy. Europe and the Middle East are now near neighbours. Last week in Cairo I called upon the Grand Shaikh of Al-Azhar. He quoted to me the verse in the Koran which provides an injunction to tolerance: \"We created you from a single pair of male and female and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other, not that you may despise each other.\" It is a fallacy to imagine our two civilisations as separate rather than entwined. In the computer age, we should not forget that we still count in Arabic numerals. Globalisation throws us into intimate and frequent contact with other civilisations. The ultimate test of diplomacy will be whether we can turn contact with other faiths, cultures, and cuisines, to enriching the lives of our people and whether we can diminish its potential to provoke friction, violence or conflict. Russia The biggest question for critical engagement is how we can accommodate post-Soviet Russia into European structures. From Peter the Great and the boyars to Stalin and Trotsky, a dominant theme of Russian politics has been the tension between those who wanted to build a fortress Russia and those who recognised that Russia must engage with the world beyond its borders. Shorn of its colourful episodes, Yeltsin's Presidency will be respected for burying the cold war and establishing Russia as a fully committed player in international forums such as the G8. Yet there remains in Russia a large audience for the old-fashioned songs of nationalism and isolationism. In part this is because the west has not been as skilful as it might have been in helping replace communism with a market economy and the rule of law. We have real disagreements with Russia and it is right to discuss them frankly. Their conduct in Chechnya is unacceptable and has produced grave humanitarian suffering. Nor, without a political settlement, will it produce their own stated objective of defeating the terrorists. We must bring that message home to Moscow, as we did on Monday when the EU suspended work on its next programme of financial and technical aid. But the wider question is how we find the diplomatic strategies that develop Russia as a comfortable, willing partner in the global economy and in global security. Russia has ceased to be an opponent of the West. But that is not enough. We need to work closely with the new Russian leadership, and get across our message to the Russian people that the advantages to Russia of being open to the west, attracting western investment and working together to resolve regional conflicts, vastly outweigh any claimed benefits of a chauvinist isolation. Global interest and national interest The second guiding principle which I set out was that our national interest will more and more coincide with the global interest. This is the one which might appear most strange to the world which Chatham inhabited. In his day foreign policy was a zero sum game, with advantage to one player automatically resulting in disadvantage to another. The balance of power which he pursued expressed the objective of foreign policy as an equilibrium of opposing forces in which the greatest threat to the national interest came from other nations. Today the more immediate challenges to our national interests are likely to be transnational forces - turmoil in financial markets, spread of the drugs trade, or proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. There is no greater national duty than the defence of our shoreline. But the most immediate threat to it today is the encroaching sea, rising as a result of climate change which we can manage only by global action. Some politicians still take a view of the world as a jungle in which the only guiding star is unilateral self-interest. In reality, diplomacy today meets the national interest by forging tactical alliances and building coalitions to secure joint objectives. That is why this government believes that Britain is best served by a foreign policy of enlightened self-interest. The labels of unilateralist and multilateralist have become inverted. It is the parties of the Right, still clinging hopelessly and touchingly to an outdated model of the nation state in isolation, who are the modern unilateralists. It is the parties of the Left of Centre, with their preference for collective solutions, who are better fitted to understand and operate in the modern multilateralist world. Britain has more to gain than any other single state from an orderly international framework for the global economy. We depend for our living on trade. We export more per head than either the US or Japan. In absolute terms, our trade with the wider world is twice as great as at the zenith of Empire. We have a larger portfolio of overseas investment than any other European nation. We have more to lose from instability in the international markets. It is fortunate therefore that Britain also has a broader representation than any other state on the multilateral bodies that will help shape the global economy. We are the only state which is a member of the G8, the EU, NATO, and the Commonwealth, and is a permanent member of the security council. Britain has a unique opportunity to pursue the national interest through the global interest. If Russia is the biggest challenge for critical engagement, reform of the security council is the biggest unresolved question for multilateral diplomacy. The size of the security council and its permanent membership still replicates the world as it was in 1945. The world has moved on. The UN itself has more than trebled in numbers. The security council risks losing credibility unless it more fairly represents the world as it is today. A modest increase in the numbers on the Security Council seems a small price to pay for a big gain in the Council's authority. That would enhance, not dilute, Britain's position as a permanent member. Universal values But even the strongest global institution will sound an uncertain note if it is not clear as to the values which it is meant to promote - which brings me to my third guiding principle, the need for universal values in an age of universal trade and global communications. The Cold War fostered client states whose repressive behaviour was often condoned in return for their loyalty to one or other camp. This was a particular paradox for the West. All too often it found itself in the pursuit of a proclaimed crusade for freedom shoring up regimes for whom freedom was not on the agenda. By contrast, the age of globalisation is creating more progressive pressures. Regimes which govern their citizens by fear and repression cannot expect the same people to display the creativity and innovation in the workplace which are essential for a knowledge-based economy. Respect for human rights is not a luxury of growth, but the condition of that growth. So it is not surprising that democracy has made major gains in the past decade. In Europe the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have chosen democracy. There are no military juntas left in Latin America. In 1975 only three heads of state in Africa were chosen by elections. In 1999, there were 32. The military coup in Pakistan has been so universally condemned precisely because it is out of joint with the times. We support human rights and democracy for other people because these are values we demand for ourselves. That is why the third theme of our foreign policy for the modern age is diplomacy for democracy.

It's a new full-length ballet based on what is probably the best loved, best known British legend and has a commissioned score from leading British composer John McCabe. It's also the final work being staged at the Birmingham Hippodrome before that theatre closes for refurbishment, with Arthur (Part 2) marking its reopening next year. In fact, the production turns out to be a disappointing hybrid - a ballet that doesn't want to be itself. But the great and honourable point in its favour is that, despite its landmark status, it resists the cosy embrace of heritage. There is not a whiff of the Tintagel tea rooms about it. Rather, Bintley and his superb design team (Peter J Davison sets; Peter Mumford lighting and Jasper Conran costumes) have relocated the legend to a postmodern timewarp. Davison's vast metal scaffolding allows the stage to move from generic, smoke-choked battle scene to minimalist court, while the rock in which Excalibur is planted glows like a slab of Kryptonite. Conran's costumes mix medieval fantasy and contemporary catwalk, with soldiers in bikers' leathers, knights in dinosaur skulls and pony-skin trousers, and women in exquisite fancy dress. The point of setting Arthur in this historical limbo is not only to tell the story freshly but also to universalise it as a study of power. Its concerns - that all great leaders have blood on their hands, that all just causes are complicated by evil and all individuals are trapped by larger destinies - remain today's concerns. So while Bintley gives due magical weight to Arthur's initiation into kingship via his miraculous seizing of Excalibur, the ballet is more interested in the deceit and violence that attend his rule. The ballet may end with Arthur's joyous wedding to Guinevere but the ceremony is juxtaposed with a film collage of children being shot: a slaughter of the innocents planned by Merlin to rid the kingdom of the infant Mordred - Arthur's nemesis. These are high aims, considered with high seriousness; but what is on stage is unfortunately less like a ballet than a high-class pageant. Stylish tableaux rattle past our eyes, adroitly taking in the detailed complexities of Bintley's libretto (to get a proper grasp of which you have to read seven pages of programme notes). But there is little that involves our brains or hearts. Apart from basic leitmotifs identifying the main characters, the choreography seems a dutiful afterthought. Neither the steps nor the mime look as if they've been imagined specially - rather as though they have been borrowed from the ballet library. So despite the hard-working efforts of the dancers, we know little about the characters they portray and we care even less - though there are a few outstanding exceptions, which show us what this ballet could have been like. In the shocking duet in which Morgan Le Fay sexually assaults Arthur, Bintley's choreography creates images available to no other medium. Tiny Laetitia Muller is transformed into a female demon, a flying succubus, who whirls around Arthur, high on her points and jabs at him viciously with her groin. Then, in a reckless leap, she vaults through the air and latches on to him with her arms flailing and her legs outspread - a vision of satanic eroticism that is equal to anything in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Also remarkable for their depth of body language are Joseph Cipolla as Merlin, and young Sophie Jones as the child Morgan - her eyes flat and baleful with forbidden knowledge even as she moves with the innocence of a little girl. To be fair to Bintley, he is not given much momentum by his score. McCabe is a master of sound painting - his volatile rhythms and variegated instrumentation serve the story vividly - but his music lacks an essential dance pulse. His strengths are most apparent at the ballet's violent conclusion, where the dancers freeze in a rictus of gaiety as above their heads film images relay the firing of guns, the screaming of children and the spilling of blood. The controlled frenzy of McCabe's score here is electrifying - it would make fabulous film music. But what also becomes clear (and this says a great deal about the production as a whole) is that this most powerful, memorable climax has been achieved by sound, film and staging - not by dance. • Arthur (Part 1) is at the Birmingham Hippodrome till January 29, the Bradford Alhambra from February 15 to 18, the Sunderland Empire from February 22 to 25, and Plymouth's Theatre Royal from February 29 to March 1.

It lies to the north-east of New Guinea, and is the largest island of the Bismarck archipelago. It's a mountainous place with several active volcanoes. The capital is Rabaul and the population, at the last count, 312,995. New Britain is also, of course, the nickname, often tagged with a telling \"plc\", many have given to Great Britain in New Labour's hands. The Blair government has been at pains in its first 1,000 days to modernise this societyless land of individuals and families (a vision of Mrs Thatcher), of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer and invincible green suburbs (John Major), of broad sunlit uplands (Churchill), of fair play (common consent), class distinction (only the truth even though we are all supposed to be middle-class now) and privatised trains (the worst part); not forgetting multiculturalism, accessibility and focus groups. A number of commentators noted that in a speech he gave recently, the prime minister used the word \"new\" no fewer than 38 times. If he had a personal mantra, it might easily be \"new good, old bad\". And it's not hard to imagine flocks of Westminster lobby fodder chanting \"new good, old ba-aa-ad\" like so many sheep. In fighting what he likes to call the \"forces of conservatism\" as if he were Luke Skywalker battling with Darth Vader, Tony Blair, imagines himself to be on some sort of crusade, part-political, part-evangelical that will lead a commercially-driven Britain towards the New Jerusalem. A new covenant will be struck between government and citizens. We will all be stakeholders in this dynamic, corporate, trains-run-on-time (except, understandably, in times of leaf falls and the wrong sort of snow) New Britain plc. And yet, \"new\" has never been inherently better than \"old\" or \"current\", even though the idea of newness suggests a world somehow shinier and cleaner than the one we know: a new three-piece suite for your home, a new formula washing powder, a New Deal for the depressed US economy of the 30s, a new pair of shoes. It is no coincidence that the word has been bandied about by evangelists and fundamentalists since the Reformation at least. And in both war and peace. Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, on whose uniforms the scary armour of Darth Vader might well have been based, was the military instrument by which the old order might be defeated and even destroyed. The New Model Army was as much a political as military force, its muskets the smoking symbols of a New Britain, mid-17th century style. The new order lasted just a few years. In the same century, New Amsterdam (New York from 1664 when captured by the British from the Dutch) must have promised a better world than the tired old Europe protestant settlers had left 40 years before. The New World itself, which surely contained, or so Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century believed, El Dorado - the legendary city of gold - implied something a little closer to the New Jerusalem than the tired civilisations of the Old World. \"O brave new world,/That has such people in't\", says Miranda in Shakespeare's The Tempest. She's just met new people outside her prescribed world on Prospero's magic island for the first time; they happen to be the unpreposessing Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio; \"O my America, my new found land,/My kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned\", just 15 years earlier John Donne wrote punningly, of his new love in his exquisite poem \"To his mistress going to bed\". New lovers, aren't they the best? Free of \"baggage\" as it's fashionable to say (ie of having lived a life, an old life, and thus irredeemable and best replaced by the new as if they were a car, a clutch, a set of shock absorbers). \"New fares\"announced on London Underground posters are surely better than a price increase; the word \"new\" is there to take something of the bitterness from the long-suffering commuter's pill. And so it goes on. Only last week I was shown a packet of ready-made dhal from Tesco Metro. \"New!\" squealed the packet, and yet Indians have been preparing lentils this way for many thousands of years; GM foods aside, as recommended by the New Labour government, there is nothing really new in the world's larder. We do not think much of this new food. New Man would certainly have been suspicious of it. Remember him, that soft-bearded 80s wimp who liked dungarees and Kicker shoes and who would have adored to have breast-fed his babies in public if only he could have? Twit or not, New Man, as the words imply, was meant to be somehow better than Old Man, who drove Jags and drank whisky while pacing hospital corridors when the wife was in labour, and had about as much idea of how to change a nappy as how to identify the G-spot. What spot? G-spot; the sort of thing girls with nothing better to do wrote about in magazines with names like \"New Woman\". In the same humour, the New Left, 60s student radicals who were meant to read Marcuse, smoke dope, refuse Cape apples and be in touch with their feelings, were presumably superior to the Old Left (pipe-smoking, teetotal types who had supported Stalin in their salad days). New wave music of the late 70s was surely better than the old pomp rock of the early 70s. In the world of chic Parisian fashion, surely the \"Nouvelle vague\" had been a cut above \"la vieille vague\"? By the same token,\"New Journalism\", ushered in by Tom Wolfe and gang with its literary pretensions must have been a point-size up on the Old Journalism (whatever that was, although it conjures images of Evelyn Waugh's William Boot sending inept telegraphese messages via cleft-sticks from some improbable war-zone to Fleet Street)? And who remembers having to study the \"New Maths\" at school? This was new, therefore better than the old maths (trig, geom, alg etc) even though it made about as much sense to most 11-year-old schoolchildren as a reading of A Critique of Pure Reason in demotic Greek, loosely translated, would to a gnu. And here the idea of newness begins to crack and strain at its neoprene seams. If the new maths was seemingly designed to make schoolchildren suffer, the \"news\" broadcast on television and radio is far more often sad than happy whilst there are few advocates of New Towns this side of Peter Hall, author of Cities in Civilisation. As for the New Millennium Experience Company (a gloriously Germanic mouthful), the less said the better, yet the old museums with their pre-human dinosaur bones and ancient mummies are widely considered to be greatly more interesting and entertaining than the new Dome, a fabulously costly celebration of the new corporate sponsorship. The idea of newness in religious, political and social thinking, far from being inevitably good and leading to the best possible of all worlds, is often fraught with danger. At best it's a conceit, an emotion, an advertising slogan whether used by the makers of \"New Square Deal Surf\" or neophiliac politicians. The sad truth is that in our quest for new beginnings, we have destroyed as much as we have created. Think of Pol Pot with his absurd, vicious Year Zero. What was the point of destroying an old civilisation? Because the Cambodian warlord could. As Mao could in the Peoples' Republic of China. A \"permanent revolution\" would keep society ever-red and ever new. Millions had to suffer to disprove an ill-made political point. New covenants, new deals, newness in all things is no guarantee of better things to come. What became of the animals of Manor Farm when Napoleon, not forgetting his spin-doctor Squealer, ousted Farmer Brown? Were they better off than before? Of course not, said Orwell. Are we in Britain any happier today for being told what to do and what to say by what has been increasingly perceived as a bullying bunch of messianic and self-important control freaks obsessed with new technology like so many schoolboys sitting alone in their bedrooms downloading weird games? Blair opposes the new with what he calls \"the forces of conservatism\", both left and right and with a large and small \"c\". William Hague and his party, well and fine, but conservatives in general? What on earth does he mean? To conserve is hardly a bad thing whether home-made jam, an ancient yew tree, an age-old right-of-way, a country house, a species of endangered animal or much loved customs and follies. And better than conserving is connecting old and new, the poetry and prose of our lives. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Burke compared the state to a tree that whilst it needed pruning to keep its branches healthy, the act of cutting it down or uprooting it could only destroy civil society. In his radical Vers une Architecture (1923), and despite its bombastic revolutionary language, Le Corbusier demonstrated how the new aesthetic of the motor-car, ocean-liner and aircraft could be translated into architecture without losing its connection to the age-old proportional systems that had given us the Parthenon in classical times, Notre-Dame in Gothic. Yet, when the book was translated into English by Frederick Etchells (1927), it was given the title Towards a New Architecture, which was was a different point and not the one the great Swiss architect was making. Bach created radical music in the 17th century, yet it was rooted in the classical elements of mathematics and architecture. Of course, the Goldberg Variations or the St John Passion would have sounded odd at first if these pieces could have been played to ancient Greek audiences, yet they might well have decoded the structural relationship between their architecture and Bach's scores soon enough. Bach's music, in other words, was rooted deep down in a very old world indeed. As was, of course, the music of Stravinsky and the art of Picasso in the 20th century. Visitors to the Museo Picasso in Barcelona are nearly always taken aback by the strength and conviction of this restless artist's student drawings, things of voluptuous classical splendour. Equally, Picasso was deeply influenced by the old arts of black Africa which he encountered with Braque at the great Paris exhibition of 1900. What all these artists had in common was their ability to connect with the sensual world in all its glory - old, new, exotic, close-to-home - and to reconfigure it through the clarifying or distorting lenses of their mind's eyes to push and even shock us into looking or listening to the world in fresh ways. They were never new in the Blairite sense of the word. Oh, but \"new\" suggests vigour, youth, freshness and vitality. And it sells, washing powder, sex and politics. And, if you don't like this obsession, you can always clear off for an old way of life in the old New Britain, that island where, one imagines, time stands pretty still, somewhere in the Bismarck archipelago to the north-east of New Guinea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2000/jan/29/weekend.julieburchill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-29T03:44:25Z","webTitle":"Turning rancid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jan/29/weekend.julieburchill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jan/29/weekend.julieburchill","fields":{"headline":"Turning rancid","bodyText":"I seldom go to the cinema - largely for the same reasons that I rarely, if ever, lick out toilet bowls or watch paint dry - unless it is to accompany my 13-year-old son to one of those three-and-a-half-hour subtitled films about the Dalai Lama, which he feels are such a vital part of his spiritual and artistic development. However, once a year comes a film so deliciously preposterous-sounding and so roundly and universally ridiculed that I am forced - in the interests of hilarity and sociology - to abandon my rule and treat myself. By and large, this divine error will be to see what they call a \"British film\", usually one that has been adapted from an acclaimed novel and that aims itself fair and square at Mr Blair's \"trendy\" New Britain. And, invariably, there will be a great deal of people associated with it - all of whom previously had a good deal of credibility - suddenly Losing It Big Time. Last year's choice cut, for example, was Mad Cows, in which a veritable smorgasbord of previously immaculate reputations - among them, Anna Friel, Joanna Lumley, Sophie Dahl, Kathy Lette, director Sarah Sugarman - were roundly trashed, rather in the manner of that awesome machine that can reduce the lushest of luxury motors into a one-inch metal cube. This year's treat has got to be Rancid Aluminium, in which a gaggle of ace Brit faces - Tara Fitzgerald, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, a Fiennes, Dani Behr, Nick Moran - are left with a good deal of egg on them. Bless! The reviews for the film have been uniformly vile, but the one that interested me most pointed out that, as both Steven Berkoff and Keith Allen were in it, its dreadfulness was signalled well in advance and so anyone who parted with their money for a ticket expecting decent - as opposed to indecent - entertainment had only themselves to blame. The way this critic described it, the Allen/Berkoff alliance was a sort of Stalin-Hitler pact of bad acting and general hammery. Now, I know that, while living the lotus-eating life down here in soft old Sussex, I've taken my eye off the ball a bit in recent years, but the last time I looked both Berkoff and Allen were bywords for raw, simmering sexuality, fierce integrity and, frankly, incendiary talent. Now, apparently, they pack a punch somewhere between that of Mutt and Jeff, and Crystal Tips and Alistair. In short, they've Lost It. How'd that happen? I think I know. It's because people want to lose it. This is a previously unexplored avenue, as credibility is popularly considered something that we cling to through thick and thin. As a lividly thin, pale, credible young thing (moi) wrote in the Face back in - aaiiieeee! - 1984: \"Credibility has replaced paying one's dues as the official credentials needed before a career in the communications industry can get off the launch pad. When you are rich and famous, you can do without it - though it hurts you so! - and once it is gone you will just have to live with the loss. Like virginity or a contact lens, once you lose your credibility you won't get it back, at least not in this life.\" But was I happy? Well, yes, but not as happy as I am now that I'm a portly old hack with about as much cred as a hostess trolley. I was talented, too; why, looking back at my second collection, Sex And Sensibility, I think there's a case for saying that between the years of 1983 and 1992 I was the best critic and essayist in this country, which probably means THE WORLD. Those were the days when I could change Kim Philby's mind about giving another interview to the West; when Radio 4 called me \"the cleverest woman in Britain\". And did I enjoy it? No. Couldn't handle it. Used to get actually physically sick before I wrote; I was thinking too much, you see. Nowadays I only get sick when I drink too much, which is a much better deal. There is a real, sensual kick that comes with Losing It, which I'm sure Messrs Berkoff and Allen have discovered for themselves and which explains why they are pursuing their goal so thoroughly. You're not meant to say it, though. You can leave your children, dump your spouse and put your parents out to grass on a sex farm, and still get away with it, in reasonably Bohemian circles. But if you - happily! - admit to betraying your talent, there's the most ridiculous amount of wailing, teeth-gnashing and finger-pointing. It's mean to say it, of course, but the types who go in for this sort of moralising - oh what you could have been! - are always the types who never had any talent themselves in the first place, and so can't believe you had the gall to throw yours away. Think of poor Salieri, beseeching God to give the Gift to him and not to that moronic, dirty-minded \"creature\", Mozart. Or of the hotel waiter who turned up at George Best's suite door bearing two bottles of Moët on ice: Best was back in Belfast to open a supermarket, for which he'd been paid £20,000 in cash, which now lay scattered across the king-size bed; his latest squeeze was the current Miss World, Mary Stavin, who was sat at the dressing table wearing two wisps of oyster silk and fixing her hair. The waiter took it all in - the Miss World, the £20,000, the champagne - and uttered the heartfelt cry, \"Oh, George, where did it all go wrong?\" Likewise, Laurence Olivier told Vivien Leigh, \"I am sick of the myth of the Glorious Couple\", and promptly retired to Brighton with Joan Plowright, a woman as plain as her name, to commute every day to the Royal Court in London, taking a great delight in wearing his sober suit and hat, carrying an umbrella and briefcase, and passing for normal. Making films as bad as Harold Robbins' The Betsy was the ultimate luxury for him, not hardship - he was cocking a snook at that final sacred cow, his talent. The same happened to Richard Burton when he dumped the goddesses for a BBC PR girl and threw himself into a welter of bad films. It's like climbing Everest, destroying your talent; you do it because it's there. If you've got it, flaunt it; if it ain't broke, break it. After a few years, there's something a bit precious about having too much talent, something a bit up yourself. Far better to throw it on the fire and join the hoi polloi. This, I am sure, was the reasoning behind the decision of those Titan talents, Keith Allen and Steven Berkoff, to make a film as bad as Rancid Aluminium. As one who has gone before them into the kingdom of mediocrity and found it a right laugh, I salute them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
