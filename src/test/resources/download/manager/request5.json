I can never look at the moon without recalling this heroic exploit. It was achieved only 12 years after the first object, Sputnik-1, was launched into orbit. Had that momentum been maintained, there would surely have been footprints on Mars a decade or two later. That’s what many of our generation expected. However, this was the era of the space race between the United States and the USSR, when Nasa absorbed up to 4% of the US federal budget. Once that race was won, there was no motivation for continuing this huge expenditure. To young people today, these exploits are ancient history. Yet space technology has burgeoned. We depend on satellites every day, for communication, weather forecasting, surveillance and satnav. Robotic probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds; several have landed on Mars. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. What’s more, humanity, or rather a narrow sliver of us, may be on the verge of an era of space exploration that makes the moon landings seem parochial by comparison. The last visitors to the moon – Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan, on Apollo 17 – returned in 1972. During the subsequent 50 years, human spaceflight has seemingly regressed: hundreds have ventured into space but, anticlimactically, none has done more than circle the Earth in low orbit, mainly in the International Space Station (ISS). The scientific and technical payoff from the ISS isn’t trivial, but it has been less cost-effective than robotic missions. Nor are these voyages inspiring in the way that the pioneering Soviet and US adventures were. The space shuttle was, until its decommissioning, the main vehicle for transporting people to and from the ISS. It failed twice in 135 launches. Astronauts or test pilots would willingly accept this level of risk – less than 2%. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as a safe vehicle for civilians (a female schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe was one of the casualties of the Challenger disaster in 1986). Each failure caused a national trauma in the US and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made, with very limited effect, to reduce risks still further. During this century, our whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes. These technologies are far more advanced than Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which was launched nearly 25 years ago on a seven-year journey, and spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. In coming years, robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures in space: huge, gossamer-thin mirrors, for telescopes or solar energy collectors, perhaps using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. Such robots could repair spacecraft even in high orbits. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are eroding the need for humans in space. The fact that the Apollo 17 astronaut Schmitt was a geologist enabled him to gather especially interesting samples of lunar rocks and soil. But future probes to Mars will be able to make such choices themselves. If you can get a robot to do it, why send a human at all? Nonetheless, I hope people do follow the robots – as adventurers, rather than for practical goals. Private-enterprise ventures such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have brought a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates. They have managed to improve rocketry and cut costs. Moreover, they can be less risk-averse than Nasa, and still find volunteers willing to tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these cut-price ventures – with private sponsorship, rather than public money – that should be at the forefront of human space travel. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing that such ventures are routine and low-risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be “promoted” as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Later this century, courageous thrill-seekers – in the mould of, say, Ranulph Fiennes or the early polar explorers – may well establish “bases” independent of the Earth. Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. But what is the longer-range goal? Musk and my late colleague Stephen Hawking envisaged that the first “settlers” on Mars would be followed by literally millions of others. But this is a dangerous delusion. Coping with the climate crisis is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the top of Everest. There will be no “planet B” for most of us. But I still want to cheer on those pioneer “Martians” because they will have a pivotal role in shaping what happens in the 22nd century and beyond. This is because the pioneer settlers – ill-adapted to their new habitats – will have a more compelling incentive than those of us on Earth to literally redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. These techniques will be, one hopes, heavily regulated on Earth – but those on Mars will be far beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. It’s these space-faring adventurers, not those of us contentedly adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era. It’s perhaps in deep space – not on Earth, or even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive six billion more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer – perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy. Interstellar – or even intergalactic – voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. Even though we are not the terminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we humans could claim truly cosmic significance for jump-starting the transition to electronic entities, spreading our influence far beyond the Earth. But this raises a further question: will our remote progeny be the first intelligences to spread through the galaxy? Or will they encounter something already out there, whose origins lie on a planet around an older star where evolution had a head start over us?

Victorian households will be able to access rebates for both solar panels and a solar hot water system under the widening of the program announced on Tuesday. Households can now only take part in the solar panels program or the hot water rebate, but not both. Meanwhile, an additional 50,000 businesses across the state will become eligible for solar panel rebates and an interest-free loan to slash up-front installation costs. When the household changes come into effect in mid-May, almost 190,000 Victorians who previously accessed a $1,400 rebate to install solar panels will be able to access an additional 50% rebate – of up to $1,000 – to have solar hot water or a high-efficiency electric heat pump system installed. When the 10-year scheme was announced, the government said the policy aimed to cut the state’s carbon emissions by almost 4m tonnes and would result in household solar generating 12.5% of the state’s 40% target for renewable energy by 2025. Alison Reeve, the deputy program director for energy and climate change at the Grattan Institute, said a large part of the state’s transition to a low-emissions future required a phasing out of its reliance on gas. “Switching people from gas water heating to solar heating is a positive step on that journey,” she told Guardian Australia. “In Victoria you’ve got a lot of houses with gas heaters installed and it takes time for that change to kick through.” The discovery of natural gas in the 1960s in Bass Strait has caused it to become the state’s dominant residential fuel source, particularly for heating homes in winter. The department of industry and science’s latest energy statistics, released last year, show Victoria’s gas use from the residential sector is 14.8% – almost double the nationwide figure of 7.9%. When the solar homes scheme launched in 2018, the Andrews government estimated a solar hot water system could save a household up to $400 each year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Clean Energy Council’s director of distributed energy, Darren Gladman, said the exact dollar figure of savings would depend on a household’s hot water consumption. Gladman said an advantage of using solar energy to both generate electricity and heat water was that it allowed you to store the benefits within the water system. “There are some [solar] hot water systems that allow you to keep water hot,” Gladman said. He said a well-insulated system would mean electricity would not be needed at night to heat the water “when energy is more expensive”. “You’re using the store of hot water to allow you to heat up the hot water when the electricity is cheap and use it later in the day or in the morning or evening.” Gladman stressed that rising gas prices meant relying on gas for hot water would become more financially inefficient in the future. The state’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the expansion of the scheme would help more Victorians save money on their energy bills, support clean energy jobs and help the state reach its target of a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. “There’s eight out of 10 Victorian households that are now eligible to get both the solar panels rebate and the solar hot water rebate,” she said. “The difference now is that rather than just having the choice of one or the other, they can actually get both, meaning that they will actually now be saving more money.” But the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Ellen Sandell, said Victoria needed to do more to end its reliance on gas. “We very much welcome this announcement, but it also makes no sense that at the same time the Victorian Labor government still supports laws which force new home developments to connect to expensive gas,” she said. “We don’t need gas – what we need is a proper plan to stopping supporting multinational gas corporations, electrify our homes and power them with 100% renewable energy.” The government will also expand its $47.5m solar for business program from Friday to help employers cut their energy costs. Businesses with up to 50 employees will be able to access a rebate of up to $3,500 to install solar panels – an increase from the current threshold of 20 staff. Businesses will also become eligible for interest-free loans of between $1,000 and $5,000 to reduce upfront costs for solar installation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-21T10:17:37Z","webTitle":"Sharma labels Deves’s comments on trans people ‘reprehensible’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","fields":{"headline":"Sharma labels Deves’s comments on trans people ‘reprehensible’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Just as the day was winding down came the news that Labor leader Anthony Albanese has tested positive for Covid. He’ll isolate at home in Sydney for seven days, and we’ll have to wait and see what impact that has on the campaign. In other news: Prime minister Scott Morrison apologised if anyone took offence at him saying he was “blessed” to have children without disabilities. Those comments aside, families are being left without the help they need from the NDIS. The ongoing saga of Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Katherine Deves, continued, with news attorney general Michaelia Cash rejected changes aimed at excluding transgender people from single-sex sport. A Nationals candidate is under fire for telling her congregation she wants to “bring God’s kingdom” to politics. The fallout continued over the security deal between Solomon Islands and China, with questions over what Australia could have done. Catch up on the day in politics and what the leaders got up to with the Campaign catchup and the daily election briefing. And more extreme weather is on the way for Queensland. See you back here tomorrow, where Amy Remeikis and the politics team will keep you in the loop on all the campaign twists and turns. Katharine Murphy on Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s Covid positive plot twist: The former senator and veteran Labor man Doug Cameron making his thoughts clear: Fingers crossed the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, didn’t pass it on (by all accounts, his team was being as Covid-safe as possible): James Massola, the national affairs editor at the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, had a preview of Labor’s just-in-case-of-Covid plan: Swift response from the Greens leader, Adam Bandt: The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has been on Sky News, where host Tom Connell asks her about the possibility of China building a military base on Solomon Islands, after the countries signed a security agreement. She says prime minister Manasseh Sogavare has assured her it would not be permitted. “He’s been unequivocal about that,” she said. That said, (she said): Of course we are dealing with this deeply concerning decision very seriously. Asked if the Australian government had any responsibility for that decision, she said: Ultimately it’s a sovereign decision. That is their right and decision to make but we’ve been explicitly clear and in a respectful way ... we think it is not a constructive approach to regional security. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has issued this statement: Following a routine PCR test this afternoon ahead of interstate travel to Western Australia, I have returned a positive result for Covid this evening. I have been testing regularly as part of my election campaign duties. I will be isolating at home in Sydney for the next 7 days and will continue to follow health guidelines and advice. While at home I will continue my responsibilities as alternative prime minister and will be fighting for a better future for all Australians. I am grateful to know that I will have access to the world’s best health care if I need it, because of Medicare. I am feeling fine so far – and thank everyone for their well wishes. Thousands of applications for grants to support communities devastated by floods in the New South Wales northern rivers and western Sydney have not been processed, while thousands of others have been rejected. Read the story here: That ratio of tests to positive cases is pretty intense*: * It’s not as straightforward as saying most tests are now coming back positive, because negative Rats aren’t recorded. Neither are false negative Rats. Still interesting numbers... Read Ben Smee’s story below about the Nationals candidate Kimberly Hone. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has come out to say he stands by Hone. The ABC reports that when asked about her comments, Joyce said: You can say what you like in this country, because people have fought and died for it. If you don’t agree with someone’s views that’s also your right. “Well done, Australia,” says the electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, confirming 96.8% of eligible Australians have enrolled to vote: With many nations around the world campaigning to get even three-quarters of their population enrolled to vote, this result is a continuing source of Australian democratic pride. The roll has increased in pure number terms by 804,652 since the previous federal election in 2019, a rise of 4.9%. Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s day, including some more genius from his advance team – does that stand for “better off overall test”? AAP were there: Action man Scott Morrison had his eyes on the prizes today on the campaign trail. AAP captured some great shots: Blessed be. Prime minister Scott Morrison has apologised for saying he was “blessed” not to have children with disabilities. But the story doesn’t end there. Jane Lee and Katharine Murphy discuss the future of the NDIS in today’s Campaign catchup: Like any good valet, Josh Butler is here to make your life easier. He’s pulled together today’s highlights – from doggos and a Judo flip to the NDIS and pork barrelling – in today’s campaign briefing: For Darumbal woman Aunty Sally Vea Vea, the handover is a “settling” after past atrocities: They treated killing us like a sport. The prime minister’s office has been ordered to process a two-year-old freedom of information request from Labor for documents relating to the Angus Taylor/City of Sydney scandal. In October 2019, Labor’s Mark Butler sought documents from the PMO related to the scandal over altered documents the energy and emission reductions minister’s office used to suggested City of Sydney had spent over $15m on travel – claiming the council’s travel outstripped the carbon impact of travel of federal ministers – when in reality the figure was just over $200,000. Butler sought from the PMO communications and documents relating to the scandal, including talking points, emails, text messages, and encrypted communications between the PM, PMO, Taylor and Taylor’s office. PMO refused the request on the grounds it would take too much time and divert attention from the work of the PMO. However after a two-year appeal to the office of the information commissioner, the PMO has now been ordered to process the request. It is the third ruling of its kind from the OAIC in the past few weeks, with Guardian Australia winning a similar ruling for texts between Scott Morrison and his friend and prominent QAnon conspiracy theorist Tim Stewart. The PMO has also been ordered to process a request for text messages related to Barnaby Joyce’s time as drought envoy. In refusing the requests, there was a consistent theme from the PMO that the processing of the requests would take too much time for the office and the prime minister considering how busy the office and the PM are, but in each instance that claim was rejected. The acting freedom of information commissioner Elizabeth Hampton said in this ruling that she was not convinced the gravity of the work of the prime minister’s office was enough to exempt the whole office from FOI: While the prime minister has significant responsibilities as the head of government, official documents held by the prime minister can be requested under the FOI Act, which carries an obligation to devote part of the resources of the office to this task. The PMO’s submissions regarding ‘most’ FOI requests requiring the FOI coordinator’s specialist attention are not persuasive. All three orders will require decisions released before the election. The PMO has not responded to questions on whether it will comply with the OAIC ruling. Back to the Wentworth debate – Sharma and Spender are getting some curly questions from the good burghers of Wentworth, including on why Sharma hasn’t pushed back more on the rightwing sentiment of the Liberals and why Spender is “splitting the moderate vote” by not running for a different seat. Sharma defends his record, taking credit for being “one of the people” that pushed for more renewable energy support, crossing the floor against his own party on the religious discrimination bill, and pushing for more ambitious climate targets (even though, as Spender pointed out, the Liberals still have “Tony Abbott’s targets” of a 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030). “Those are the sort of things I can do, but I’m also part of a team,” Sharma said: I’ve argued in the past and I’ll continue to do that, but more ambitious interim targets ... I’ll continue to argue that. Sharma and Spender were both asked if they had solar panels on their house or electric cars. They both said they didn’t have solar panels (Sharma said he lived in a terrace house, which made it impossible) and Spender said she had a hybrid car. Paterson is having a crack at Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, and Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, for criticising the government’s failure to somehow prevent the deal going ahead. He says he doesn’t know if they’ve had security briefings on the matter, and that they were “irresponsibly canvassing very sensitive matters”. Liberal senator James Paterson is talking about that deal between Solomon Islands and China (he’s also chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security). He’s on the ABC, and host Greg Jennett asks him when he knew about the deal. He says he was only aware when it became public, but that he had been aware before that of China’s intentions in the region. He says: We have known for some time it’s the ambition of China to expand its presence in the region ... it did not come as a surprise and we did learn about the agreement as it became public. There’s no doubt it’s a very serious challenge to our regional security. We got experts to watch and analyse United Australia Party’s campaign ad so you don’t have to (unless you want to, like 15 million other people): The press release for this didn’t mention the NRL in the all-caps header (DOLPHINS RECEIVE $15 MILLION FOR NEW COMMUNITY FACILITY) and I pictured the cheeky mammals frolicking in a nice playground under the sea: Back at the Wentworth debate, Sharma has called the comments of Liberal Warringah candidate Katherine Deves on trans people “reprehensible”: [They] should be condemned and they should be withdrawn, and I’m glad she has withdrawn those. The Wentworth MP also said he didn’t back the “save women’s sport” bill from Liberal senator Claire Chandler, and wouldn’t support it if it came to a vote. Earlier, the PM, Scott Morrison, said he had contacted Deves to “encourage her” today, saying her advocacy to prevent trans women playing in female sports “finds a lot of resonance with Australians who just want common sense to apply”. Sky News is broadcasting a debate between the Liberal’s Wentworth MP Dave Sharma and independent Allegra Spender. The very first question is on which party Spender would support in the event of a hung parliament (which, after recent opinion polls, is looking a little more likely). Spender said she was “open to work with either side of government”, saying she would “be legislating and voting on the basis of what’s important to this community”. Sky host Kieran Gilbert pointed out there had never been a Labor member for Wentworth, and that Labor’s policies were closer than the Coalition to Spender’s own policies – Spender said she would work “issue by issue” in the event of a hung parliament. But Sharma hit back, demanding Spender declare before the election who she may support: I think you’re being dishonest with them ... you owe it to the public. We have [policies], you can sit down and decide which one you’d like to support. The Anzac Day dawn service in Sydney is expected to attract 10,000 people, AAP reports. It’s the first in two years with no Covid restrictions. NSW veterans’ affairs minister David Elliott said it was also the first since the 80th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin, 80 years since the Kokoda campaign, 50 years since the withdrawal from Vietnam, and the first since Australian troops withdrew from Afghanistan. Elliott said: A lot of the contemporary veterans are feeling a bit vulnerable as a result of the situation of Afghanistan. I would expect that you may see an increased number of younger veterans and their families. Climate change discussion has been conspicuously hushed so far this campaign. Adam Morton is here to turn up the heat, with the latest Temperature Check: About that crash we mentioned earlier: Australia needs a clear policy on climate change if it wants to rebuild its relationship with Solomon Islands, retired admiral Chris Barrie said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters following a conference on fuel security, Barrie said Australia was “kidding ourselves” about its relationship with its Pacific neighbour. Barrie said: We have to stump up and be a good friend of countries in the Pacific like the Solomon Islands. That means a change to climate policy, to be honest. Because they look at what we do in climate change and say, ‘where are you? When we’re facing the loss of our country, the loss of our identity, the loss of our culture, you call this part of the family? I’m sorry, it doesn’t work.’ Solomon Islands’ government signed a new security pact with China on Wednesday in what has been called the “worst Australian foreign policy failure” since the second world war. Barrie described the moment as a “failure of Australian government policy” and pointed to the appointment of former politicians to diplomatic postings, rather than trained diplomats, as a contributing factor. Also speaking at the conference was the independent MP Zali Steggall and Allegra Spender, a Sydney-based businesswoman running as an independent in the seat of Wentworth. Steggall said the issue of fuel security was “incredibly important” in the wake of geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and “even here in our backyard in the Pacific” but accused the government of “fake net zero commitments”. She said: We know the government is absolutely doubling down and locking in reliance on oil and gas. We have only a handful of days’ supply and we are incredibly exposed – over 90% of our fuel is imported. The one way we can achieve [fuel security] is by electrifying our fuel and our transport. We can do that because we are the most abundant continent in the world when it comes to solar and wind. Steggall said she would work to legislate a plan to reduce emissions by 60% by 2030 in the new parliament: We’re talking a lot about cost of living in this election, but let’s be frank. Cost of living is immediately impacted by global warming events. Food, fuel, insurance costs, disruption to business, all of these are impacted by events like what we’ve seen with the floods on the east coast. Action on climate change is not a ‘nice to have’. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also been in Bennelong today with the Liberal candidate for the electorate, Simon Kennedy. Ah, Bennelong. The Liberal MP and tennis legend John Alexander is putting away his balls (that’s a tennis reference) after more than a decade representing the seat. It’s been considered fairly safe Liberal territory since Alexander won it from Labor’s Maxine McKew in 2010. McKew famously lifted the seat from former prime minister John Howard in 2007. How do I know all this? I started with our excellent seat explorer: I wonder if the advance team deliberately had Labor leader Anthony Albanese walk past signs saying Rats, vaccines, and boosters available: Luke Henriques-Gomes has gone beyond the headlines about prime minister Scott Morrison’s “blessed” reaction to Catherine, whose son Ethan is autistic, to look at systemic failings in the NDIS: I love a good graph, until they scare me: Thanks, Amy Remeikis, and thanks all in advance for gentle treatment. I had the 2am wake-in-frights that I’d inadvertently swapped “Albanese” and “Morrison” somewhere along the way. Did not feel blessed. Tory Shepherd is going to lead you through the late afternoon and evening. Be gentle – she is still recovering from last night’s debate coverage. Make sure you check back for updates and stories from the Guardian crew. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning – please, take care of you. Just back on the NZ prime minister – she is in Japan at the moment, where New Zealand is being honoured with a live musical performance featuring dancing kiwi fruit. Anne Ruston told Sky News the government has accepted the aged care royal commission recommendation to have “nursing care” in all aged care homes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week but just needed to work out a “realistic” timeline to make it happen so the health system could handle it. But that is not the government’s policy. It hasn’t accepted the “24/7” recommendation for registered nurses. What’s the difference? RNs can do things not all nursing staff can, including administering pain medications. Ruston also said there was a 2024 timeline in the royal commission: But there’s not. Then there is this point: Jacinda Ardern has spoken on the China-Solomon Islands security pact, as Eva Corlett and Daniel Hurst report: Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, has spoken of Beijing’s “growing assertiveness” in the Pacific region as she challenged the motive for a security pact between Solomon Islands and Beijing. Australia, New Zealand and the US are concerned the Solomons pact could allow China to establish a military base within 2,000km of Australia’s east coast. The text permits China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. Speaking to the BBC, Ardern said: “One of the reasons we’ve expressed this disappointment [is] … Australia and New Zealand both have heeded the call of the Solomons for support during recent disruption. “And we’ve again highlighted that should any extended need exist, we are there to help and support. What gap remains that requires such an agreement with China?” Queensland police say the car that crashed into Terri Butler’s office lost control, and that it was not a “targeted incident”. Police have been able to review CCTV footage nearby and believe the car was speeding and overcorrected on Old Cleveland Road at Greenslopes. The male driver lost control and crashed into Butler’s electorate office. He then drove off. Police are still looking for the vehicle. That contradicts what Scott Morrison said yesterday: Well, first of all, I’d say this. The prime minister of Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim that there’s no basis to make that assertion. It’s not there. That would be the first point that I would make. Today, Morrison was a little more Dutton-leaning in his assessment. Here are some of the ‘blunt’ comments Peter Dutton, the defence minister made on China on Sydney radio 2GB the prime minister mentioned in his earlier press conference: I don’t think there’s any sugarcoating the reality of China’s actions, not just in the Indo-Pacific, but around the world. I mean, they’ve got this Belt and Road Initiative. It’s all about militarising ports across the world so that they can have a military presence. And I’m not going to pretend to your listeners that we are not coming into what I think are dangerous times. And the intelligence indicates that China’s own words and actions prove that. And we should be very conscious of it. We’ve seen this deal between Russia and China now. And China operates in a very different world. Leaving the Solomon Islands aside for one moment, you know, they go in with bags of cash. I mean, they don’t operate by the same rules that we do. They go into countries, they buy people off, and Australia doesn’t do that. And we can’t compete in that circumstance. In the case of the Solomon Islands, guarantees have been given. I don’t think they’re worth much, but they’ve been given that they won’t set up a military port. But that’s exactly what happened in the South China Sea. Where you know, assurances were given by president Xi to ... to president Obama at the time that there wouldn’t be a military presence. Well, there are now 20 islands with runways and military buildings on within the South China Sea. And that is what we are dealing with. So when we say that we’re coming into a dangerous time, [we’re] not making that up, that’s exactly what is happening. Queensland police are searching for the driver of a vehicle that crashed into the Brisbane office of the Labor MP Terri Butler then drove off this afternoon. There is no indication yet as to whether the incident was an accident. No one was hurt. Butler’s office is on a main road in the suburb of Greenslopes. Terri Butler says police are on the scene and the condition and whereabouts of the driver remains unknown: On the subject of debates: Ben Smee will have more detail on this very soon It’s been the morning after the night before. Scott Morrison for much of this morning has been battling criticism about his observation in last night’s leader’s debate that he and wife Jenny had been “blessed” to have two children without special needs. During a morning radio interview with Ray Hadley, Morrison dug in, arguing his observation was meant empathetically and in good faith. But later at his press conference on the hustings, the prime minister apologised for his choice of words, telling journalists he understood how the comment may have been hurtful. Morrison referenced a conversation this morning with Dylan Alcott, the Australian of the Year and high-profile disability advocate. Alcott had been critical of Morrison’s formulation this morning, noting people with disabilities just wanted equality, choice and control. Alcott noted he felt “blessed” to be disabled. With a campaign fire now running, Morrison flopped down full-body to douse the flames. Morrison is also fighting controversy on another front. Rather than be blamed for Solomon Islands signing a new security deal with China, the prime minister wants to train attention on what he contends is Labor’s record on being soft on China. We’re in the process of examining that particular contention in more depth, but suffice to say, the prime minister was rebuked by Canberra’s national security establishment (including the Asio chief, Mike Burgess) only a couple of weeks back for claiming differences that weren’t actually there. When that point was put to Morrison this morning, the PM said something along the lines of we run the government, not public servants. Before I go, there was one more point of interest from this morning’s press conference. Morrison was in the Queensland seat of Longman this morning. That’s one of Labor’s targeted seats in the 2022 campaign. The impression I’ve picked up over the past few days from strategists is Labor currently isn’t that hopeful of switching that particular seat to their column on election day. But Morrison was pretty direct this morning – he indicated Labor’s scare campaign contending that pensioners will be put on the cashless debit card had some legs in the seat. Longman has a lot of retirees. The prime minister suggested he was in Longman to combat the lies. This bit of sandbagging is interesting. If you want to read more on Labor’s scare campaign, here’s a fact check from Paul Karp earlier this week. As Paul says, the Coalition at one point left this idea open. But the government has since ruled out this change for pensioners, repeatedly and comprehensively. No wiggle room. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 50 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,265 In hospital: 61 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 16 Cases: 17,447 In hospital: 1,641 (with 69 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 655 In hospital: 49 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 9,281 In hospital: 578 (with 17 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 4,079 In hospital: 241 (with 11 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,468 In hospital: 58 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 11 Cases: 10,674 In hospital: 444 (with 35 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 2 Cases: 9,314 In hospital: 248 (with 9 people in ICU) Reconciliation Australia has released a list of election demands of all major parties, which it says will need the next parliament to be “brave and ambitious” about making change. In a “‘roadmap for reconciliation” released today, it calls for the next government to: Introduce legislation setting out support, a timeframe, and process, for a referendum to achieve a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to appropriately fund and meet the targets of the national agreement on closing the gap. Support truth-telling including investment in research to uncover the untold, and under-told, parts of our shared history. Recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories with memorialisation, renaming electorates and other public places. Strengthen the national curriculum to better include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures. Fund an “anti-racism framework” to guide actions by government, NGOs, business, police and the community. Appoint a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children’s commissioner to help reduce the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out of home care. Strengthen cultural heritage protection through funding and engaging in a co-design process with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance and other First Nations stakeholders, and acting on the outcomes of that process to make necessary policy. Karen Mundine, the CEO of Reconciliation Australia says: We know that almost 90% of the Australian community support formal truth-telling processes, and the majority of Australians want more to be done by government to close the gaps in health, justice and employment. The public is on board and our work shows it wants governments to step up too. Australians are looking for leadership and greater ambition on reconciliation. Whichever party forms government, it needs to be brave and ambitious when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. We ask the incoming government and all parties represented in the next parliament to be brave. Make change. The View from Murph will be with you very soon Q: Last night more voters in the room picked Anthony Albanese over you, a quarter remained undecided after [the hour long debate]. What does that say about your chances after last week’s campaign gaffes from Anthony Albanese, and ... if you don’t win, will you stand down as Liberal leader? Scott Morrison: What it says is ... there are 4.5 weeks left in the election and Australians are looking carefully. Many of them haven’t made up their mind. And they will be making up their mind over the next four and a half weeks. What they know is what they don’t know about Anthony Albanese. What they don’t know about his plan. What they don’t know about his experience on national security. And on economics. What they do know is what they do know about our government. The Liberals and the Nationals ... keeping Australians safe, keeping our economy strong because a strong economy means a strong future. Thanks very much, everyone. He doesn’t address whether he would stay on as leader. It was a fairly abrupt end to the press conference. Q: On Dom Perrottet [and texts]? Scott Morrison: Happy to touch on that. When I spoke to some close colleagues on the weekend, they asked me whether Dom had been contact and I simply said he had. I didn’t share any text messages. I said he had been in contact. That wasn’t released to anybody. Q: How did- You’re the journalist, you talk to people who talk to people who talk to people. He did not and neither did I. They [the messages] haven’t been [leaked]. All that people know is the premier was in touch with me and indicated his support for the decision that we had made and that’s the truth. It was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph by his own words. I am in regular text contact with leaders all around the world ... and I continue to be, and I will always be, because it’s an important part of my job to ensure I remain in regular contact and as a result, when it comes to my relationship with Dom Perrottet we work closely together. We’re creating jobs in NSW and here we are doing the same in Queensland and that’s what today’s announcement has been about to ensure we can do that. Q: A hundred million dollars has gone in community funds to marginal electorates since the budget. How can that be described as anything other than pork-barrelling? Also, Dominic Perrottet has been the latest person whose private text messages to you have made the front pages. Why should foreign leaders trust you that you won’t release their private text messages? Scott Morrison: I’ll give you a good example [on grants]. Today you’re with me in Caboolture. We announced the program for the regional telecommunications dealing with periurban areas. More than half of the seats that benefited from the program were Labor seats, not Coalition seats. The majority were actually Labor seats. So I just don’t buy it. What elections are, we go to the public, and like in Caboolture today, there we were with seniors who can only get one bar on their mobile phone or only 3G, and they need some additional mobile towers. So they raised that with Terry [Young], their local member, Terry raised it with us, and they expect us to do something about it. That’s what elections are. People expect the government to deal with issues on the ground in their communities. Whether it happens to be facilities or services, health services or education services, support for important manufacturing jobs, we’re talk about them right here, additional jobs right here in the electorate of Bonnar. These are important things that need to be done. We respond to those, we are telling people very plainly – the Labor party are making their commitments in their places that they wish to make commitments, I make no criticism of that. But people know what they can vote for. And what they could work for with me and my team, sitting here with Angus and Ross here in Bonner, is they can vote for a strong economy. They can work for a team that has produced a strong economy in one of the toughest challenges we have ever faced, or they can vote for an opposition. And he spoke a lot last night, Mr Albanese, he spoke about how Labor were the party of big reforms – I make the point it’s always the Liberals are Nationals that have to work how how to pay for them – he spoke about the big reforms and talked about Bob Hawke. As you know, during the Hawke Keating-government, no, [Albanese] wasn’t an economic advisor to the Hawke Keating advisor. He was an electorate officer for Tom Uren. What he wasn’t doing that he was at Labor conferences denouncing the Hawke-Keating government, conference after conference, I supported the Hawke government more than Anthony Albanese did, John Howard supported the Hawke government more than Anthony Albanese did. So he’s no Bob Hawke. He is not even a Kevin Rudd. And I can assure you not John Howard. Over the last three years, he has sought to make a virtue not of being a big ideas man, but a no ideas man, because he wanted to be a small target. So here we are just before the election ... he’s madly scrambling around, he has no plan, it’s a choice between a government you do know and ... an opposition you don’t. Australians are making the choice because it’s a choice. Q: On Katherine Deves, you said you don’t want her to be cancelled or silenced. My understanding is that she wants to speak out and would like to correct the record but it’s actually your campaign stopping her from speaking out. Will you let her speak in front of the media and if not, why not? Scott Morrison: Katherine is campaigning and I’ve been in contact with her today to encourage her. Katherine is passionate about the issue of women and girls in sport and I think the position she has set out on the issue is one that I think finds a lot of resonance with Australians who just want common sense to apply in the situation and for it not to be turned into a broader debate about other issues which I think distract from the main point, which is women and girls in sport, and ensuring that that debate can be had sensitively and properly. Q: On Solomon Islands you said ... you know a bit about national security. Earlier this year when you and other ministers made similar comments about China, the head of Asio said politicising national security is, quote, “not helpful”. Why did you repeat that comment when our national security agencies are saying it’s not helpful, it’s doing Australia disservice? Scott Morrison: When you’re prime minister you run a government. Public servants don’t run the government. Prime ministers and the ministers run governments. And I chair the National Security Committee for a very long period of time as prime minister and have served on it in a number of capacities. What’s important, particularly when we deal with issues that have been risen in an election campaign right now and challenges were being made about the government’s handling of a particular issue, then I think it’s perfectly reasonable for me to set out that when the Labor party has had to choose between taking a position in support of the government on matters of national interest, be it with our coercion that we faced from China because we’ve had foreign interference rules or we have said no on foreign investment sessions, or we’ve called out on major public health issues, then I would have expected in bipartisanship on national security that there would be a common view. But there wasn’t. There was criticism. Bipartisanship, I don’t think should be set at a low bar. We set a very high bar when it comes to national security. If the Labor party wants to aspire to that, then I think they have to lift their game. Q: Do you support Emma McKeon’s comments today that she won’t compete with trans women and you consider yourself a supporter of women’s sport? Scott Morrison: Yes and yes. Q: Following on from that, would you be comfortable about your daughters competing against transgender people? Would you feel comfortable about your daughter competing against transgender people in sport? Morrison: Sports will make their decisions but my preference is for girls to play girls, for women to play women, boys to play boys, men to play men. I don’t think this is a terribly remarkable statement. I think it’s common sense. For those who are trans, I want them to participate in sport as well. I want them to have opportunities for inclusion in sport and every Australian to be treated with dignity. But we also have to have common sense here so whether it’s Emma, or anyone else who has made comments about this in support, and as Katherine who has been a champion of these, Katherine Deves [says], it’s a common sense position which I think Australians understand. They want it to be dealt with sensitively and respectfully and so do I. But it’s a pretty straightforward common sense position which I think Australians agree with. That answer continues: To the other point, I meant no offence by what I said last night but I accept that it has caused offence to people and I have been in contact today and I apologised directly to Dylan Alcott about that. I think people would also appreciate that I would have had no such intention of suggesting that anything other than every child is a blessing is true. Every single child is precious. And a blessing to every parent. I don’t think that’s in dispute and I don’t think anyone would seriously think that I had intent of anything different to that. What I was seeking to do when talking to Catherine about her son, Ethan, last night and I had the opportunity to talk to Catherine after the debate last night, took her details, [the department will be in touch] about her particular case, Catherine certainly didn’t convey to me that she had taken it in that way. But I can appreciate particularly in some of the ways it was communicated, and the way it was sought to be represented by our political opponents in the mill of an election, that it could have been taken in a different context and I’m deeply sorry about that. The points that Dylan Alcott [made] are right. It’s about equality and it’s about access and it’s about being able to live life on the same terms as everyone else. That’s what the National Disability Insurance Scheme is all about. I it’s a very important scheme. I know Labor things it’s a very important scheme. It’s a very difficult scheme to run. There are challenges in running a scheme of that scale which is now bigger than Medicare. And every single individual’s case is different. Every single case is different. I was simply trying to make the point last night – and I’ve often referred to my own children’s as a blessing, we were 14 years in the waiting to have our children – but my point is I wasn’t trying to imply that I could first-hand understand the challenges people face in those situations. I was seeking to respect the challenges they face. Not the opposite. I would hope that people would accept that at face value and I deeply apologise for any offence it caused. Q: You didn’t answer the question on when you found out about the potential deal between China and Solomon Islands because at the moment Zed Sesejla is saying the Government found out when the draft was leaked. Second that, will you apologise for comments made last night: Labor is says you should apologise for the comments regarding the NDIS story? Scott Morrison: I am pleased to address that issue and I’ve had a chat with Dylan Alcott about those issues today. Going back to the other issue, what I was saying is [I won’t go into] specific details of an agreement ... I won’t go to those specifics as it goes into issues of national security so I won’t do that. No, what I’m telling you, no, I’m sorry, I knew about national security. I’ve been on the national security committee for eight years. Anthony Albanese, I think he was on it for less than three months. So I know a bit about these issues and what you can and can’t say about national security issues. What I have said very plainly is we have always been aware of the risk of an agreement like this. We’ve been aware of the Chinese seeking to obtain an agreement like this, as they have in Papua New Guinea and other countries in the Pacific, as they have done in African countries. And we know what they’ve done in those countries, as we have seen them do things in Sri Lanka and places like that. We have said how the Chinese operate in developing countries and how they seek to gain favour in those countries. They don’t play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies like Australia and the United States and Japan and India, the United Kingdom and France and other countries like that. They play by different rules so that makes our job difficult. These are sovereign nations making their own decisions. Q: A number of retirees we spoke to at that retirement village said they are worried about the pension cut. It is clear your message it is just a Labor lie is not cutting through. What can you do now? Will you go into it, launch a counterattack and maybe letterbox some pamphlets of your own, will you complain to big tech? What do you do now? Scott Morrison: That’s why I was in Caboolture and I welcome opportunities to present right here, and my members are doing the same thing around the country: Labour are telling a despicable lie to pensioners seeking to frighten them to vote for the Labor party. We are not extending the cash list debit card to pensioners, we are not forcing that on pensioners. That is an absolute lie. What I found interesting in talking to those pensioners this morning is they remember back in 2016 when Bill Shorten said we were going to privatise Medicare. He put it on a big bus! And it was a blatant and awful life. Medicare has only got stronger under our government. Not weaker. I’ll tell you why, because a stronger economy means a stronger Medicare and this election is about having a stronger economy under the Liberals and Nationals, or a weaker economy under Labor who can’t manage money and can’t run a strong economy. That is the message that I think is well understood particularly by older Australians who know that you have to work hard, you have to save, that you have to look after your finances if you want to achieve the things in life you want to achieve and they understand for governments, it’s no different, and they understand Labor can’t manage money. Q: If they [Labor] are critical of you, they say they are on China’s side. If they are critical of anything your government does in the space, you say, well, you must be on China’s side. Is that your argument? Scott Morrison: Let me put it to you: do you think the relationship with China and the fact that they have imposed trade coercion on Australia because we put in place foreign interference laws, that we put in place tougher foreign investment laws, that we call them out on issues like the pandemic, do you think that was Australia’s fault or was it China’s fault? ... You put the question. I am simply saying ... that when we have taken decisions in the national interest, and when we have stood up for Australia and on the right thing for Australia, the Labor party has joined the chorus of other countries attacking Australia. And that is just a fact. That answer continues: Now we had a good discussion about this issue last night as you would have seen. I made a couple of points and Mr Albanese took some offence to what I said to him last night, but let’s just look at the record. When our relationship with China started to descend, and when China was putting in place trade blocs on Australian products, wine and barley and various things like that, they said that was Australia’s fault, not China’s fault. When I called out China for where the pandemic started and said there had to be an independent investigation into the origins of Covid, apparently this was the wrong thing for us to do. Labor said that Australia was at fault in calling for that, and our government was at fault for doing that. When I cancelled a submarine contract for $90bn because it wasn’t the right submarine for Australia, and I can assure you there is no easy way to cancel a $90bn submarine contract with a friend such as France, but when France attacked Australia over that decision, they didn’t side with Australia, they sided with the French government. And more recently now we have China seeking to influence through their means, which Peter was a bit more expressive about today. Did they blame China for doing that, or do they use it as an opportunity to attack the government? So when I look at that record, on each occasion have they backed the Australian government in standing up for Australia? Why have they run the talking points, have they run the lines of those who are seeking to criticise Australia for the important decisions that we have taken in our national interest? That is why I made the claim I did last night because it is backed up by a Labor party who has played politics with national security, despite their claims to the contrary. Question time at the Scott Morrison presser: Q: You said the Solomon Islands and China deal was not a surprise. Zed Sesejla said he found out when the draft leaked. So when exactly did the government find out that this was a sealed deal? Scott Morrison: We have known for some time the risk of a deal such as this coming about. This is why the first place I went to after the last election was the Solomon Islands. And I spoke to the prime minister there on that occasion about the threats that China presented to the region, and we discussed those issues back on that occasion, and there has been an ongoing dialogue over that entire time. And so we have been addressing those issues over a long period of time, that is why we further doubled down – I mentioned last night in the debate – the $39m financing investment we put in place for the transmission project. It is why we did the undersea cable, it is why we are the single largest provider of overseas development assistance to the Solomon Islands. It is why we continue to lift our investment right across the Pacific, because what has emerged as a result of this issue in the Solomon Islands as it has been able to further elevate the awareness of other Pacific Islanders who are also very concerned about this, just as Australia and New Zealand is, and as prime minister Arden said today – we have discussed this many times – this is a matter we are looking forward to discussing as part of the Pacific Islands forum. The threat of this has been around for a long time and I can’t go into all the details as to how Australia is able to know the specific information, as they are security matters, but what I do know is we have always been very conscious of that threat of China being able to influence a nation in our region, and you know, Peter Dutton I thought put it pretty well today. China, they don’t play by the same rules as liberal, transparent democracy. This is a secret deal, and the arrangements that are there are not public. And, you know, Peter may have put it a bit more bluntly this morning, but he makes the right point, that we are dealing with an autocratic nation that is not playing by the normal rules on how they seek to influence other nations in our region, and other nations in our region I can assure you are very aware of that. While we wait for Angus Taylor to stop speaking, here is an update on ACT’s covid restrictions, via AAP: On the eve of Covid-19 isolation rules being ditched for household contacts of people with the virus in NSW and Victoria, the ACT is expected to follow suit. The seven-day home quarantine for household contacts will be scrapped in NSW at 6pm on Friday and 11.59pm in Victoria. Close contacts will have to undertake daily rapid antigen tests, wear masks indoors and work from home where possible. They will also have to notify their employers and avoid high-risk environments like hospitals and aged care settings. The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, has indicated the nation’s capital will make a similar announcement on Thursday. “The ACT government is keen to ensure that ACT public health directions are consistent with settings in NSW and Victoria to the greatest extent possible, taking account of our local circumstances,” she told the ABC. The prime minister is in Brisbane, with Angus Taylor, talking manufacturing and how he doesn’t think the opposition understands “that we make things in Australia”. But not cars. AAP has an update on business confidence: The strong rebound in confidence among small businesses seen in late 2021 proved short-lived as the impact of the Omicron Covid-19 variant and rising costs took their toll. National Australia Bank’s small and medium enterprise business survey for the March quarter showed its confidence index dropped six points to nine index points, softening across firms of all sizes. The SME business conditions index also eased, down five points at six points. “Unfortunately, conditions remained very weak for SMEs in the hospitality sector, which has continued to face disruptions from the pandemic,” said NAB’s chief economist, Alan Oster. “SMEs in the property and construction sectors also saw conditions slip in the quarter, which could reflect a range of factors impacting the property market, including Omicron as well as slowing house price growth.” Costs also remained elevated with labour and materials availability continuing to be a constraint for a large share of firms. Scott Morrison will hold his press conference very soon. Given Scott Morrison people may not have heard what he actually said last night, here is the video: Given the Coalition has had the steerage of the NDIS for the past nine years or so, and the complaints about funding being cut, and plans being re-done without consultation with those the plans are for/families/carers and the government is funding lawyers to argue against AAT rulings, this doesn’t seem to be the defence some government MPs think it is. It hasn’t come up in the campaign as much as it should, but the cost of living is really biting. Australia’s major food relief groups have come together to ask for more attention from the Coalition and the Labor parties, given the stress on their services: Australia’s national food relief sector has come together to ensure those experiencing hardship are not forgotten in the lead-up to the Federal election and beyond. Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite are calling on all sides of politics to deliver improved food relief funding and tax incentives to help reduce food waste and feed more people. The three charitable organisations work towards the common goals of eradicating hunger and halving food waste by 2030. They act as a vital frontline safeguard in times of individual and community adversity, whether prompted by disasters such as the recent floods, global pandemic and Black Summer bushfires, or everyday poverty and inequality. Together, the organisations are providing food relief to more than a million people per month across Australia, distributing more than 85 million kilograms of food and groceries in the 2021 financial year. Yet despite these record volumes, the current community need is not being met, and Federal Government funding for the food relief sector is not confirmed beyond next financial year. Ahead of the Federal election, Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite are seeking three key commitments from all the parties and independents to ensure vulnerable people have consistent and reliable access to food: 1. Sustained and adequate funding for food relief 2. The establishment of dedicated disaster preparedness and emergency food relief programs 3. The introduction of a national food waste tax incentive, making it easier for the food sector to redirect its surplus for food relief We stan Joesphine’s concern for the climate. It’s the Reserve Bank (an independent statutory body) which sets the cash rate, which interest rates are based on. But this graph shows how governments are considered to have that power. Scott Morrison should be holding his press conference very soon. He is in Queensland, in the electorate of Longman (which is held by the LNP). Labor is targeting it, but is unlikely to see a win there. The leaders’ debate on Sky News Australia on Wednesday night had 175,000 viewers nationally, according to ratings figures from OzTAM. The Sky News People’s Forum was the most watched program on subscription TV last night where it beat Gogglebox (111,000) and Paul Murray Live (85,000). The Morrison v Albanese contest had a bigger audience than the Friday night contest in 2019 between Morrison and then Labor leader Bill Shorten (95,000), according to analysis by TV Tonight. However, the last free-to-air debates on Seven and the ABC in 2019 drew 550,000+ and 600,000 respectively. The OzTAM figures do not include those who watched it via a free livestream on skynews.com.au and news.com.au, or those who watched through the Flash news subscription service. SBS on Demand also produced a Mandarin and Arabic version and the program was broadcast on free-to-air TV via Sky News Regional. The highest-rating program on free-to-air on Wednesday night was Seven’s The Voice (629,000 metro viewers). The Mad as Hell season finale on the ABC won its slot with 401,000. Our New Zealand friends are seeing inflation take off, with March quarter headline CPI coming in at 6.9%. The reading will be watched by a few on this side of the Tasman not least because we are also a smallish open economy, largely at the whim of global markets. The consensus CPI expectation, according to the ANZ bank, was 7.1%. (Might be a bit mean but we do wonder how many people form the “consensus” given the NZ economy is a lot tinier than, say, Victoria or NSW’s economy.) Of interest to Australians will be what’s been rising in price, not least because we get the first-quarter CPI result on 27 April. The RBA minutes this week said they expect a figure of “above 3%”, which wasn’t very insightful as inflation was already running at 3.5% for 2021. As the ANZ noted, food prices added the most (one-third) to the quarter-on-quarter increase of 1.8%. Thank Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for that. Fuel prices were up 32.5% on a year earlier, and 8.8% higher for the quarter. NZ, as in Australia, cut its fuel excise late last month but only for three months (versus six months here). The 25 NZ cent cut (from about $NZ0.70 to $NZ0.45) will ease some of the price pressure in the current quarter and - along with the NZ Reserve Bankalready lifting the interest rate – has economists hoping the CPI spike may be near its peak. Anyway, whatever the Australian CPI number is, it’s unlikely to nudge the RBA to lift the cash rate target at its May meeting. June, though, looks a strong bet. What the 27 April number may do, though, is put “cost of living pressures” back on the election campaign agenda. The issue was largely absent from last night’s “leaders debate”, which was a surprise but perhaps points to the success the government had with its budget neutralising the issue through the $3bn fuel excise halving. We’ll see whether it stays neutralised. Apple will soon roll out a new iPhone feature in Australia that will, when enabled, scan messages sent to and from children detecting whether nudity is in the photos. The feature, called communication safety in Messages, can be switched on by parents, and when a message detected to be a nude photo is detected trying to be sent or received, it will be blurred, and will warn the child it may contain sensitive content. It’ll direct the child to child safety resources online, and the child will be given an option to tell an adult about it. The scanning is all on-device, meaning Apple never sees the messages, the photos, or harvests any data from the analysis. Apple said: Messages analyses image attachments and determines if a photo contains nudity, while maintaining the end-to-end encryption of the messages. The feature is designed so that no indication of the detection of nudity ever leaves the device. Apple does not get access to the messages, and no notifications are sent to the parent or anyone else. The company first launched the product in the US, but will now expand it to other markets including Australia. My colleague Alex Hern wrote about the product in depth for the UK announcement overnight. How would a Labor government handle China? Anthony Albanese: The issue with Beijing will be problematic. Regardless of who is in government because the stance of Beijing has changed. I have said that repeatedly. But my philosophy, and I will finish with this. My philosophy is consistent with the Biden administration ... where he speaks about competition without catastrophe. We have to recognise what is happening in the region, we have to recognise that China is more forward-winning. They are seeking to increase influence in the region and we need to respond to that. We have to call out the behaviour of China inputting sanctions against Australian businesses, because that sanctions against Australian jobs. And it is entirely inappropriate. The press conference ends. Labor instigated Medicare, the NDIS and the aged pension, so what “big thing” does Labor offer this campaign? Anthony Albanese: My big thing is taking clean energy and using that to bring back manufacturing to this country, and to have Australia become a renewable energy superpower. That clean energy to drive jobs and advanced manufacturing. Jobs that exist for domestic purposes, but also export. We see in the Sun Cable project, to get an example. An opportunity that’s there. Sun Cable project gave Australia renewable energy, solar energy, powering Singapore. Powering Singapore. An extraordinary project. We have an incredible opportunity to make more things here and in coming days, hopefully you will be with us, we will be visiting places where we want to make more things here. Q: Just on religious freedom, you have said if you win in May, you will legislate the National Integrity Commission this year. Will you also do the Religious Discrimination Act this year and as part of that, will you abolish those exemptions in the Act that allows schools to discriminate against transgender and gay people, will that happen this year? Anthony Albanese says he won’t put a time table on all Labor’s legislation and then says: Since the government, let’s be clear about what happened here, since the government introduced legislation, it was amended consistent with what the prime minister wrote to me and said should happen with the legislation. They then withdrew it. The government promised, like prior to the 2019 election, that they would get this done. Scott Morrison always goes missing. And he always blame someone else. And in this case, in this case he has blamed as of his own party. Members of his own party. I mean, we sat until about five o’clock in the morning in order to get this legislation through. Because the government had not prioritised it. They were too busy doing sports rorts, too busy with their scheme on commuter car parks. There were too busy on the other priorities. We will get, all of our policies will be a priority. All of our priorities will be a priority. And yes this time, one of the things that I’m doing, to be very clear, about one of the big differences between me and Scott Morrison, I am running in this campaign to be Australia’s prime minister to implement the policies that I am taking to the selection, whether it be the NBN, whether it be cheaper childcare, the establishment of the national reconstruction bond. A Religious Discrimination Act, a national anti-corruption commission, this term. This term. I will be held to account. I will be held to account for that. One of the things I would do is what characterises as prime minister, which as he always goes missing and he always blame someone else. Q: Can I just ask you on NDIS. Senator Linda Reynolds has said that your plan for expert reviews will add time and bureaucracy. Can you guarantee that won’t happen? And also what did you make of Mr Morrison’s comment last night regarding being blessed not to have had to dealt with those NDIS issues? Anthony Albanese: Well, on the latter, I was asked about this before, but ... But I’m not a commentator. But I was asked about that before. I think that – all children are a blessing for parents. And the first bit – NDIS – NDIS, look, we have outlined the policies about removing the distant bureaucracy that’s occurring. We heard from the mother of young Ethan last night the problems that are occurring in practice. People are having their plans cut because a bureaucrat somewhere who isn’t in touch with what their issues are are making decisions. Ellie, who I spoke about last night as well, I know that she – I saw one of the things that she tweeted last night as well. You know, her circumstance, quite frankly, we had some of you were at the press conference with Ellie and Dougie. Dougie, I think, was from Canberra, just telling their stories about the impact. The NDIS is about our humanity. It’s a proud Labor reform and what’s happening is that people are having programs cut, the idea that someone can be told that colostomy bags are no longer part of their plan and when they asked, “Well, what am I supposed to do?”, they get told, “Can’t you just reuse them?” even though they’re very susceptible to infections. And the consequences of that, the consequences of that are far more dire in terms of a potential hospitalisation, acute care. We need to make sure that we get this right. I’m very confident that Bill Shorten’s plan that he’s put forward and that we have endorsed and we’re going to this election on is about putting people back at the centre of the NDIS. That’s what it’s about. ... If there are unfair cuts have been made, absolutely. People should get the care that they need and some of these cuts – inevitably there are changes made to people’s plans that they work through, but they need to be ones that actually improve the capacity to have a quality of life. Where there are cuts that have been made that make it worse for people’s quality of life, that make them less employable, that make them less able to participate in society, that should not happen. Q: Just a quick question on local matters. Gilmore has a huge homeless issue and lack of housing issue. What is Labor going to do about that? Anthony Albanese: We’ll have a Housing Australia Future Fund. Our fund will have 20,000 additional social housing units, but will also build affordable housing units for essential workers. Now, of that 20,000, I know that domestic violence is an issue right around the country as well. We’ll make sure that 4,000 of those units, those dwellings, are available for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have additional funding for emergency housing, we have a specific fund as well for Indigenous housing, for fixing up Indigenous housing in areas as well. So we have ... ... Homelessness is a huge issue, particularly in our regions. And what we know is the biggest group where homelessness is growing is older women. It’s older women who just can’t find anywhere to rent. The prime minister told them they should just go buy a house, that was their solution. Q: Peter Dutton has said that China won’t waste any time expanding its presence in the Pacific in the wake of that deal with the Solomons. If you’re elected next month, what will your government do to address that? Anthony Albanese: We’ll actually not go missing. We’d turn up. Where has Peter Dutton turned up? I tell you what – the people of the Pacific know. They have all seen the video of talking about how funny it is that countries are going to go under water. They have all seen it. And these are the people in that video – Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton – who are negotiating with the Pacific. How do you think they feel? How do you feel the people of Tuvalu, the leadership of Kiribati, the leadership of our Pacific Island neighbours feel about this? This government have gone missing. They had enough notice to engage and do something about this. China is more aggressive. China is more forward-leaning. We all accept that. The difference is how do you respond to it? Do you respond to it by trying to play domestic politics? Or do you respond to it in a strategic way - in a strategic way – that makes a difference? And we have been warning about this for some time. We opposed the extradition treaties being signed between China and Australia because they have a different view about the rule of law and about human rights and yet the government condemned us and said we were undermining business opportunities by doing that. I make this point as well: The government of which I was a part and leader of the government in the House of Representatives, the Gillard government, did a deal and put US marines in Darwin. This government sat back and went missing while the port of Darwin was sold to a company with direct links to the Chinese Communist party. Clearly not in Australia’s interest for that to happen. So in terms of national security and taking these issues seriously, we will. We will engage with our partners, we’ll engage with the region, we’ll take these issues seriously because we have to. Q: Mr Albanese, how will your federal Icac be in the landscape of state and territory bodies of a similar nature, for example, Peter Malinauskas in South Australia as opposition leader supported a model that is much weaker than Scott Morrison’s, for example, one that you say is not good enough? Anthony Albanese: Well, we’ll support our own model and Mark Dreyfus has outlined the principles in our model – one that’s allowed to have public hearings, one that has independent powers investigation, one that can subpoena and take action in order to ensure that it produces outcomes. Look, we need to – we need to restore faith in our politics and be very clear – Scott Morrison in 2018 announced before the last election when he was prime minister, he stood up and did a press conference, he didn’t have to do it, he stood up and said, “We’re going to have a National Integrity Commission”, as he called it. We could call it a National Anticorruption Commission. He then did nothing until the 2019 election was called. The 2019 election was called and he said, “We will legislate a National Integrity Commission.” We have gone three years and he hasn’t even introduced the legislation into parliament and during this election campaign, he has made it very clear that there will be no National Anticorruption Commission if he is re-elected. That is very clear. So it’s a stark contrast – if you want a National Anticorruption Commission, you have to vote for a Labor government because it’s only a Labor government that will get it done. Q: Can I ask: how many of your other colleagues shared that position that you had back then? Anthony Albanese: Everyone supports our position. The Labor party’s position is very clear – we support boat turnbacks. And what’s extraordinary here is that this is an example of the prime minister looking for divisions where there aren’t any. The truth is boat turnbacks have worked. The truth is that the Labor party have been very clear about supporting boat turnbacks. I support it. Everyone in my team supports it. We’ll implement it. Q: Can I ask a question of your candidate. You’re a signatory to a document in 2015 which says you fiercely opposed turning back the boats. What is your current position? Does it remain the same? Fiona Phillips: I absolutely 100% support Labor’s policy. Absolutely. Q: Why have you changed uyour mind when you were a fierce advocate for not turning back the boats recently. Phillips: There’s been two conferences since then and as MP, I absolutely support Labor’s policy. (Anthony Albanese tries to move back to the microphone) Q: Sorry I’m asking the question of the candidate. Can you articulate the reason why you changed your mind? We now understand Mr Albanese has. Q: And when did you change your mind? Albanese: She has answered that. Reporter: She hasn’t. Phillips: I like many members have gone to national conferences and just like we should we discuss items and I support that position. Absolutely. That’s what I did in the 2016 election and the 2019 election. So nothing has changed. I support Labor policy. I support regional offshore processing and if required and safe to do so boat turnbacks. Q: Do you think the prime minister is downplaying the prospect of the Chinese military base being built in the Solomons given we heard Barnaby Joyce say that it could become a little Cuba. Anthony Albanese: Well, Barnaby Joyce’s comments were quite extraordinary. He, again, you think he had nothing to do with this. He is the deputy prime minister of the country and the deputy prime minister of the country who was allowed to make a public comment on one of the few occasions in this campaign has said that this is like Cuba, likening it to the Cuban missile crisis that occurred on the doorstep of the United States. We know that the Solomons is a strategic destination. We know during World War II some of the fiercest and most important battles for control of the Pacific occurred there. And we know that the United States very much relies upon Australia and sees Australia as playing that key role of partners in the Indo-Pacific and that Australia and Scott Morrison has just gone missing. The United States is sending Kurt Campbell, its senior representative in this region. I have known Kurt a long period of time. He is a world-respected figure. We sent a junior person across there for what is a really serious matter and is beyond my comprehension that in spite of all of the speculation that has occurred, there’s been no action. Marise Payne on the Insiders program said that basically this was all under control. It’s quite clear that it wasn’t. Q: When did you change your mind [on boats], Mr Albanese? Anthony Albanese: I have answered that. I make a public statement at the time. Q: Do you think it was insensitive last night the prime minister saying how blessed he and his wife were who had children who didn’t suffer autism? Anthony Albanese: I think every child is a blessing for parents. Q: Mr Albanese, if I can about some comments last night. In 2015 you said that you couldn’t ask someone to do something you couldn’t see yourself doing yourself regarding boat turnbacks. You said if people were on a boat and putting families and children, you yourself couldn’t turn that around. When did you change your mind? What was it specifically that made you change your mind given it sounds like quite a strong view you head in 2015? Anthony Albanese: When I announced it. When I announced it at the time. Labor supports turning back the boats. Scott Morrison is asked about the criticism of his comments in the debate last night, where he said he was “blessed” not to have a child with a disability and says: It took us 14 years to have Abbie and we refer to her as our miracle child and then we’re blessed with Lily. What I was saying in good faith and Catherine who I was speaking to whose son, Ethan had an autism, eh, um, disabiliy, she didn’t take it that way. I was just simply saying that it’s tough and I’m grateful that these hardships that I and Jenny haven’t had to deal with. They’re other things. But it’s tough and it’s hard. Of course there is no greater love than a parent has for a child, and particularly a child who has special needs, and and it is a blessing. But I was just simply trying to say in good faith, look, I haven’t walked in your shoes, Catherine, I’m not gonna pretend to say that I understand it as well as you do. And that’s all and the fact that Bill Shorten and others seek to leap on that and twist the words and turn it into something I just thought showed really bad faith and tried to take something that was meant in a good spirit and just use it for political purposes in the middle of the campaign. So that says more about him. And I know others have jumped on that. And then they probably haven’t heard exactly what I said. And so I can understand if I they were just listening to Bill Shorten that they’d say that but I thought that was just pretty poor from Bill. Ray Hadley says it is something he has said many, many times himself and he has friends who have children and grandchildren with disabilities. Morrison: It’s a hard road and it’s the very definition of limitless love. I think. It really is. And I just think they’re amazing Australians and their kids are and we love them all. And we really respect what they do and supporting families with special needs and disabilities shouldn’t be a partisan thing. We support the NDIS we’ve had to fund it. It’s hard to fund and and it’s a big commitment and we believe in it. It shouldn’t be something that is being torn apart and used and partisanised in this way. I just thought it would just bad form. Given Ray Hadley and Scott Morrison are still talking about boats, it is worth pointing out that Morrison has not identified any intelligence that there is any issue. Labor has said it will keep turning back boats when safe to do so. It’s straight into another spiel on the economy, before mentioning that the mobile reception in Caboolture is “not great” and announces another reception blackspot program. Caboolture is just outside of the Queensland capital, it is not exactly the sticks. The Coalition has been in power for almost a decade. Make of that what you will. Then it moves on to the Labor scare campaign over putting pensioners on the cashless debit card. Then, without irony, it moves on to the Coalition scare campaign on Operation Sovereign Borders (which is treated very seriously). Scott Morrison is in Longman, and tells Ray Hadley that “you’re very popular up here, mate”. Morrison is at a retirement home. Ray Hadley’s “analysis” continues, asking his listeners “who do you trust” to protect the borders, and drops in this pearler: Anthony Albanese who doesn’t know his beeeeeeeeep [they actually used the sound effect] from his Albo? Scott Morrison is late for Ray Hadley, so he is filling in time. He says that Kristina Keneally is in “witness protection” and then adds “with all due respect” because “she has had the virus”. “But she can still talk,” he says. The Labor campaign has moved away from Queensland and is now in the electorate of Gilmore. Labor holds the seat with a 2.6% margin and the Liberals want it back, putting in former NSW state minister Andrew Constance against Fiona Phillips. Labor think they can hold on to the electorate, but both sides are throwing a lot at it. Scott Morrison will speak with Sydney radio 2GB’s Ray Hadley in the next 15 minutes or so. Labor senator Katy Gallagher, who has a daughter with autism, was asked about Scott Morrison’s “blessed” comment on the Seven Network this morning. She said it was “deeply offending and deeply upsetting”: Gallagher: As the parent of a wonderful daughter with autism, I was really upset by that comment. I found it really offending and quite shocking. And it’s something that people who have a disability, children with autism, it’s the kind of response they get all the time, that people are blessed not to have what they have when in actual fact every child is a blessing. Certainly my daughter Nat enriches my life and my partner’s life every day. She’s wonderful. And I think that again just shows a lack of connection with everyday people’s lives. I mean, there’s millions of us who live with children with a range of different needs. And to have a prime minister say he was blessed not to have one of those is deeply offending and deeply upsetting to those of us who have that wonderful addition in our family. And you can add the Australian of the Year Dylan Alcott to that list Luke just reported (former Australian of the Year, Grace Tame’s tweet is below). Amy brought you Liberal senator Hollie Hughes’s defence of Scott Morrison’s “blessed” comments earlier. As Amy mentioned, Hughes’s son Fred is autistic, and Hughes is a big supporter of the NDIS, even criticising the government over its handling of the issue at times. Respected disability advocate Craig Wallace, meanwhile, had this to say: But it would be fair to say that for many, many others, the prime minister’s comments have been deeply hurtful. Nicole Rogerson, the founder of Autism Awareness Australia, a group that Hughes has widely praised, posted this pointed response to Morrison. The organisation itself was even more scathing: Here is some other reaction to the comments from autistic people and those with autistic children. And if you watched the debate, you would have heard Anthony Albanese talk about a woman who had been told by the NDIS that she would now have to re-use her colostomy bags. That woman was Elly Desmarchelier, a disability advocate who had this to say about Morrison’s comments. This morning, on Sky News, Zed Seselja, in listing what he said was Labor’s “misrepresentations” on the Pacific situation, didn’t list the August warning as one of them: Well, Penny Wong has fundamentally misrepresented the situation and, in fact, completely misdiagnosed the response. So, Penny Wong and Anthony Albanese and the Labor party have made false claims about cuts that aren’t there. We are spending a record amount when it comes to aid in the region, when it comes to security arrangements in the region, when it comes to our Covid response. We have stepped up in every way. And the Labor party haven’t said what they would do differently, but we know what they did do differently – they did a lot less in the region when they were there. They cut defence spending, and now what they are saying, and what Penny Wong said again today and what Anthony Albanese has said is that it’s, in fact, about climate change and the climate change response, which is just an absurd argument, which goes, I think, to their fitness for office. Yesterday afternoon, the Pacific minister Zed Seselja disputed Labor’s claim that the Morrison government had been warned China was looking to establish a military presence in Solomon Islands in August last year: So she’s [Penny Wong] claimed, and I think she’s shown herself to particularly be unfit to be foreign minister. She’s claimed that this is a resolve to cut aid. That’s not true. We have actually substantially increased the aid budget to the region since we came to office. So when the Labor party were in office, they were spending a lot less when it came to aid, and indeed a lot less on other co-operation, like defence co-operation in the region. So that’s the first lie. The second lie was that we knew about it in August. That is simply not true. Q: And what was the earliest knowledge that you had? Seselja: We found out about it when we saw that leaked draft. So Penny Wong is simply making that up. That’s not true and our officials have confirmed that. In March, Matthew Wale, the leader of the Democratic party, the Solomon Islands opposition, told the ABC he had tried to warn Australia in August. He said: I have intimated as much to the Australian High Commissioner and officials that this was in the offing, even as far back as last year — all the indications were there and the Australian government did nothing about it — so I’m extremely disappointed in the Australian government. Josh Frydenberg is on the campaign trail today, campaigning in Sydney’s west with the Liberal candidate for Bennelong, Simon Kennedy. Sitting MP John Alexander announced he would retire at the election. The Liberals are expected to hold on to the seat. New South Wales has recorded 16 Covid deaths and 17,447 new cases in the past day. More people have died of Covid so far this year in Australia than in 2020 and 2021 combined. Victoria has released its Covid numbers for the past 24 hours, with 10,674 new cases and sadly 11 deaths. Simon Birmingham was doing the media rounds this morning. We’ll bring you more of that interview a little later. Finally, asked if Australia believed, as at least 25 human rights organisations do, that Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States, Simon Birmingham said: No, we have confidence in the independence and the integrity of the British justice system. This is a process that will be able to continue to work through that system. There remain appeal rights for Mr Assange, depending on decisions that have [been] made and we’ll continue to provide, where it is taken up, appropriate consular assistance. Asked about Scott Morrison describing him and his wife as “blessed” not to have children with disabilities, Simon Birmingham said: I think he was expressing the type of sentiment many Australians would understand, in terms of the circumstances where we all want to see. It’s why Australians support the NDIS, and the record investment we’re making, which has grown its funding to now be greater in totality than that of Medicare. ... It’s a vast and complicated system supporting 500,000 different Australians in different circumstances. It won’t get every single case right in terms of how it engages, but that’s why the PM took the time out afterwards to sit down with that mum and that make sure that he was able to get the details and to go back to the agency, as I’m sure he will today, to ensure they will get in touch with her. Q: I’m talking about the language, it’s the language we’re discussing, the idea he and Jenny have been blessed by not having a child with a disability. People from within your own party have said it’s not right that people with a disability are continually portrayed as being a burden on those around them. Birmingham: Well, it’s certainly not that. It is simply the case that, as a country, all Australians, I think, understand the need for us to provide additional support and we can understand as well the circumstances for family members and for others helping people living with disabilities are not always easy circumstances. And that for many of us, we are fortunate not to deal with some of the challenges faced in those cases. Q: But senator, I do want to take you up on that. This was the debate we were having in the dying days of the parliament, and all the national security experts and veterans in the field say it was unhelpful and that the ALP was anything other than supporting Australia’s policy, so why are you continuing this line of attack? Simon Birmingham: The Labor party have created the points of difference in the way they expressed themselves and the language they used. When last in office, let our investment in our defence forces whittle away to the lowest share of the economy. We brought it back to 2% of the GDP, and having that credible investment is what has enabled us to strike new defence pacts and partnerships with countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, making us a credible partner for defence and strategic investment in areas of artificial intelligence, in missile equipment and investment, and the nuclear-powered submarines. In the lead up to the election, the government has tried very hard to present Labor as being “weak” when it came to China, breaking the bipartisan pact that national security is not a political wedge. This culminated when in the last sitting week of parliament Scott Morrison accused Labor’s Richard Marles of being a “Manchurian candidate”. Former ASIO head Dennis Richardson and current ASIO boss Mike Burgess chastised the use of national security as a political tool. But last night in the debate, during an exchange about the Solomon Islands-China security pact, Morrison brought back echoes of that moment, when he asked: “When it comes to standing up to China, they’ve criticised me for being too strong, I was called a racist for closing the borders, I was protecting Australia. “What I don’t understand is, when something of this significance takes place, why would you take China’s side?” Anthony Albanese called it “an outrageous slur”. This morning, though, Liberal SA senator Simon Birmingham wasn’t backing down from it: I think we have seen a Labor party, who when China were making decisions to apply trade sanctions and tariffs against Australia, Labor seemed to want us to reach a compromise with China rather than to stand up for Australia. Anthony Albanese spoke at the National Press Club not that long ago – he suggested we should negotiate or settle some of the points with the Labor party – sorry, with China. Well, ultimately, we have to stand up for Australian interests. We’re not going to trade away beef producers in Queensland or winemakers in South Australia or fresh seafood exporters from Tasmania. We’re going to stand up for all of those industries and for Australia’s interests in term of having a peaceful and prosperous and secure region. Q: Before you go, I want to ask about more now-deleted tweets uncovered from Liberal candidate Katherine Deves. This one suggesting a link between cross-dressing men and trans women being sexual predators, even serial killers. Are you concerned by the language that Katherine Deves has used over the years? Hollie Hughes: Look, Ms Deves has deleted those social media profiles. She has apologised for the language she used. I do believe some of the language was inappropriate. But we’ve also got to have some brave discussions when it comes to these issues. And sometimes, you know, we’re talking about now, the use of a word, sometimes people say things in the moment that they don’t actually mean, or they are overstating. Q: She seems to have said a lot. There’s an awful lot of tweets. Hughes: There are tweets from a candidate in the Hunter who used photographs of naked women with big guns saying that size didn’t matter when you had 130kg behind it. There’s substantial tweets from a Labor candidate in the Hunter and everyone has gone silent on those. If everyone wants to cry about one set of tweets, they should be crying about them on both sides of politics. Q: Does Katherine Deves have your full support? Hughes: I have never met Ms Deves. But yes, she’s the candidate for Warringah, and what I would like to see is the seat of Warringah return to the Liberal National party, not a candidate who wants to fundamentally shut down our economy, who makes ridiculous claims about how climate change needs to be addressed, who also has referred to every single parent who has problems with perhaps a 15-year-old trans teenage woman or girl* using their daughter’s change room. That apparently makes us transphobic as parents having concerns about that. Saying goodbye to Zali Steggall in Warringah would be a very good thing. For that, Ms Deves has my full support. *Trans women and girls are women and girls Q: Sounds like a bit of damage control here, Senator Hughes. Hollie Hughes: We have just recently funded $1.2m to autism awareness Australia for a further project on autism, ‘What Next?’ It’s telling them the choices available to them in their life and how they can get assistance. We have put some money up for this. Q: I want to talk just briefly about the actual NDIS and the import of that question last night. Because the mother said the funding was cut by 30% at a first review with no explanation given. Labor says the NDIS needs a sweeping review and that’s what it will do if it wins government. Simon Birmingham says it’s a great scheme and we’re happy with how we’re running it. It can’t be both, can it? Hughes: It is a great scheme and it’s made a significant difference. That mother ... and her son ... I hazard a guess they went to an early intervention preschool. There’s problems around intensive early intervention. A lot of this is driven by the autistic adult community, who suggest using best practice behavioural interventions is somehow torturing those children. So there’s ideological problems within the autistic community. And some of the problems that we’re seeing in the early childhood stream in particular are because those within the agency are pushing back about good quality intensive early intervention. These are the fundamentals those children should be accessing. One thing I would say, the early childhood stream does need some review. Because I believe there are some ideological objections to children with autism getting intensive early intervention because there’s a band and a barrage of autistic adults who claim the kids don’t need it. Q: Senator Hughes, I know you have spoken about your son Fred over the years. You spoke about him in your maiden speech in 2019. And you’ve been an advocate for people with disability. You’re now refuting the thoughts of people with disabilities who last night, certainly on social media, were saying, when is the population, when is the community, when are leaders going to stop looking at us as a burden? Hollie Hughes: Look, it’s not looking at us as families or our children as a burden. It’s a recognition that we do have additional challenges. My son is a blessing but I can tell you, as I said, there were days I did not feel particularly blessed. There were very challenging days. For some of these people coming out, people in the autistic community who have been diagnosed in their later life, they didn’t experience the challenges we did as parents in the early days. Anyone who has children with a disability or without a disability will say there’s days that are challenging. If you want to talk about the word blessed as the biggest problem we’ve got facing us as parents and carers of those with a disability, this is why the disability community struggles to make constructive gains, because there’s lying underneath it a significant, almost permanent rage machine. And when the NDIS came in and a lot of people got funding for the first time, they had to find somewhere else to direct their rage. There’s significant issues with the NDIS. I have my own challenges with the agency. ... Find something of substance and stop focusing on a ridiculous notion that somehow or other the prime minister was in any way denigrating people with a disability, or their families and the experiences they go through. In fact, Scott understands better than most if for another other reason, I’m constantly in his ear about it. Liberal senator Hollie Hughes, who has an autistic son, has appeared on ABC News Breakfast to defend Scott Morrison for saying he was “blessed” to have children without disabilities: To be honest, I did not think of anything of them at all. I know Scott and Jenny had tried for 14 years to have their children and they are blessed with two beautiful daughters. I certainly didn’t take anything negative away from it. And I really do think that people are missing the point of the substantive issue here. If they want to focus on one word. As you and I have discussed previously, I’m a mother of an autistic son. I have three children. I know there were days, very early on, when my son was younger, that were really, really hard. I didn’t feel particularly blessed. I now have a teenager daughter. There’s days I don’t feel particularly blessed either. To focus on one word is missing the point. I recently chaired the Senate autism – select committee into autism, on the whole of life experience of autistics and their families. For anyone who wants to get upset about the use of one word, I suggest they read that report. We have a much higher suicide rate within the autism population. We have a higher unemployment later than the general disability population. There’s issues we can be angry about. The use of the word blessed is symptomatic of those who don’t like Scott and want to find something to cling to. The prime minister’s choice of language, saying he had been “blessed” to have children without disabilities, is going to be remembered for some time. Scott Morrison was very keen yesterday to make sure it was known that there was no military base as part of the security pact between the Solomon Islands and China: The prime minister of Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim that there’s no basis to make that assertion. It’s not there. That would be the first point that I would make. Yesterday, Barnaby Joyce contradicted him: We don’t want our own little Cuba off our coast and that is not what is good for this nation, not what is good for this region. And it looks like the defence minister Peter Dutton has done the same thing: Dutton chastised China for “not playing by the same rules”, AAP reports. “You can expect the Chinese to do all they can now that they’ve got this agreement signed,” Dutton told Sky News when questioned on whether troops would move in. “[China said] the South China Sea would not be militarised [and] today, they’re militarised. They’ve got airstrips. They’ve got fuel depots. And that’s the reality of China under President Xi.” In case you didn’t see it last night, here was Murph’s take on the debate The first thing to say is the questions from the audience were sharper and more substantive than most of the questions put to the two leaders over the past week and a half of the campaign. Voters wanted to know about housing affordability, the nursing workforce, the absent national integrity commission, funding packages under the national disability insurance scheme, the future of renewables and battery technology, the treatment of sole traders left out of jobkeeper during the pandemic, regional security, youth participation and the health of Australia’s democracy. Not one pop quiz about the unemployment rate (which dominated the first 72 hours of the campaign) or question about the life and times of the unfortunate Katherine Deves (which is continuing to dominate it). Welcome to another day in the campaign where things are really starting to get messy. Anthony Albanese was judged as the winner of last night’s debate by a slim margin (although even the Sky After Dark commentators begrudgingly awarded him the night). But it’s one of Scott Morrison’s comments that is still being spoken about. When asked by a woman with an autistic son about the future of the NDIS under his government, Morrison said he and his wife Jenny had been “blessed” to have two children without disabilities. That set off a firestorm of hurt and disbelief online, as people with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities sought to remind the PM that all children were blessings. The counterfactual to Morrison’s statement is what has upset people. He said: Jenny and I have been blessed, we have two children who haven’t had to go through that. And so for parents, with children who are disabled, I can only try and understand your aspirations for those children. The finance minister Simon Birmingham was asked about it on the ABC this morning, and tried to keep focus on how the NDIS now had a bigger expenditure than Medicare, pointing out that the PM took time to sit with the woman after the debate last night, to hear more of her story. Given the sheer amount of stories about NDIS funding being cut, not everyone can sit down with the prime minister to discuss their story and needs and receive personal guarantees someone from the department will be in touch. Birmingham also tried to turn attention to Labor supposedly being weak against China after both Albanese and Morrison fired up over national security in last night’s debate. It is going to be that sort of day. You have Katharine Murphy, Daniel Hurst, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Josh Butler to make sense of it, with Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day. It’s going to need all of the coffee. All of it. Ready or not, let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-17T12:00:28Z","webTitle":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","bodyText":"Cate Blanchett is Australian. I mention this fact because I’d forgotten it, somehow, so her manner of speaking – upbeat, front-footed, Aussie-accented – comes as a surprise. And I’ve spent quite some time hearing her talk over the past couple of days, as she has a new podcast, Climate of Change, which she hosts with her friend Danny Kennedy, another Australian. Kennedy is the CEO of an environmental non-profit, New Energy Nexus, and runs the California Clean Energy Fund. Their podcast, as you may have guessed from the title, is about the climate emergency. But before you come over all world-weary and what’s-the-point, before you get tetchy about preachy celebrities telling us stuff we already know, you might as well stop. Blanchett is already there. “You can recycle up the wazoo, Miranda,” she says (told you she’s Australian), “but it can just make you feel more cross and isolated and panicky… I get that. What we’re trying to do with the podcast is to turn the magnet towards optimism in these incredibly pessimistic times.” We’re talking via video link, but Blanchett has her camera turned off. Kennedy, who’s in his office in Oakland, California, hasn’t and he wanders around, showing us the view from the window (just some more offices, really). Blanchett’s location is a secret, due to heavy-handed PRs and her natural privacy, though I’d guess she’s in the UK (she lives in Sussex). Their location doesn’t really matter, of course, as they’re talking about a worldwide problem. The climate crisis is very real – we need to halve the world’s carbon emissions by 2030 – and becoming even more so for those living in Europe, with our reliance on Russian gas. If you think about it all too hard, you can panic. And Blanchett does, she says. In the first episode, she chats into the mic as she drives her electric car towards London and discusses how overwhelmed she can feel by the “tide of bad news”. She describes herself as a “mother of four” (the oldest is 20, the youngest seven) and an “optimistic pessimist”, and confesses to range anxiety as she forgot to plug in her car to charge last night. Her role in the show is to represent the listener, really, which is weird as she’s globally famous. But Blanchett’s everyday attitude is similar to many: she wonders aloud if making an effort, when it comes to the environment, is worth it. Why bother recycling, up the wazoo or no, if the tipping point to the end of the world is so close and the people in power are still locked into fossil fuels? She and Kennedy made Climate of Change earlier this year, mostly in a studio in east London. They have some strong guests: Adam McKay, the director of Don’t Look Up, makes an appearance, as does Prince William, to talk about his Earthshot prize. (He explains it very well, actually; it sounds much more interesting than I’d realised.) Still, at the start of the series, in common with many climate emergency podcasts, the discussion can feel rather broad, with smudgy chat about tech and innovation and the “disruptive decade”. At one point, someone says: “We are the stories we tell ourselves”, which might be true but doesn’t help that much with the gas bill. By episode two, however, the show is focusing on real-life solutions and these are undoubtedly encouraging. We meet a Filipino woman who’s designed a clean energy lamp that local fisherpeople can use; the Londoner who’s brought gardening to train stations; the designer of living sea walls that encourage plants and fish to thrive. One California company, OhmConnect, has such a good idea about reducing at-home use of electricity that I try to sign up. But it’s not yet available in the UK. What they’re trying to do with the podcast, says Kennedy, is appeal to people like me. To show us tired recyclers that the answers to environmental catastrophe are already out there. “I think the choir has heard the doom and gloom song for a long time,” he says, “and sung it from the song sheet, like a good choir would. What they haven’t been taught is the song about solutions and the fact we’ve got them.” “A lot of people are feeling fatigued,” says Blanchett. “I think we need a sense of, ‘No, don’t worry, these changes are happening.’ Because they are.” Blanchett and Kennedy met in Sydney in the early 1990s. They were part of the same social circle – Kennedy wrote a play with Andrew Upton, now Blanchett’s husband. Later, in 2008, Blanchett and Upton were appointed co-artistic directors of Sydney Theatre Company and decided to try to make the building, an old timber-and-glass warehouse, as ecologically sound as possible. They enlisted Kennedy to help. He brought in consultants – “one guy called Gavin Gilchrist: Cate, if you recall, the fellow who did the toilet flushes” – and helped redo the insulation to make the building “tighter and better, even though it was a pretty old, leaky, wooden construction”. The biggest proposal was the installation of solar energy panels, which proved difficult to get past heritage rules and the general cynicism of Sydney’s county council. “We were met by a lot of internal scepticism and external opposition,” remembers Blanchett. “You know: ‘What has this to do with a cultural institution, what does it have to do with making theatre, why are we bothering?’ So we thought: ‘OK, we’ll be at the theatre company for 10 years and we have a whole suite of ambitions. And the solar panels will probably be the last one we achieve, if we do.’ And it was the first one we achieved.” It took two years. There are now 1,906 solar panels powering lights, ventilation and air con across the building. Kennedy thinks that Blanchett and Upton’s theatre project was “a catalystic moment” that kickstarted a sense in Australia that solar power was viable and cost-effective; the country is now, he says, the biggest solar market in the developed world. Blanchett thinks of it as a “symbolic gesture” that, when added to an industry shift, “all adds up”. So she and Kennedy have known each other for ages (Blanchett recently found some old photos of his daughters when they were little) and then, last summer, Kennedy came to stay with Blanchett and her family in Cornwall. They took him to the Eden Project, which he loved, and the podcast project was started there. They visited “these old mines that are engaged in modern, clean-energy transition minerals and materials production – I’m a geek, I love that,” he says. For Blanchett, the show was “a much more primal urge. We sort of had to. I had so many questions.” I ask her about using celebrity to get attention on important issues. “Look,” she says, “if you have your two minutes in the sun, you can highlight solar technology or you can highlight an underwear line. But I’m genuine when I say that there were a lot of questions, embarrassingly ignorant questions, that I’ve been asking Danny over the decades. And I thought, ‘Well, I can’t be alone.’ When you ask a question, however ignorant or ill-informed it may be, you’re asking to open a door to a deeper understanding.” The public, with their simple questions (but why can’t we switch to wind or solar power?) often seem to be ahead of politicians when it comes to clean energy. People want environmentally friendly solutions, but the powers that be just say no. Kennedy agrees “100%” and describes a whole institutional mindset that needs to change. “For a long time, we’ve depended on these big, stodgy, 20th-century utilities where reliability was everything,” he says. “And now we’re jumping to these disruptive business models, where you’ve got distributed renewables and lots of different loads, and assets in the grid, and you need a flexible business model that’s a bit more marketplace… and the regulators can’t even contemplate it. They’re just like, ‘Oh, no. The way we do it, one big central station at a time, you’re never going to build enough wind and solar that way.’ And we’re like, ‘Yes, but that’s not how we want to build it. We want to build it on everything; every house, every roof, every garage becomes a storage system,’ and they’re like, ‘Oh, that’s all too complex.’” I can feel my gloom descending again. “Yes, but it’s just a challenge,” says Kennedy. “We live with institutions and cultural norms and bureaucracies that have trouble moving at the pace of change required, even though the technology and the consumer and the businesses are ready to deliver. That’s the tension. We could solve this.” Blanchett is keen to encourage, too. “The solution to the overwhelm is engagement,” she says. “There’s not going to be one magic bullet; it’s going to have to be governmental change, policy shifts, as well as consumer shifts and massive industry shifts. The way we do business with one another, the way we travel, it’s all of these things. At the heart of it is engagement. In the last two years, there’s been a real emotional and psychological reckoning that we’ve all been through, on top of the environmental crisis. But out of that comes a chance for renewal and we’d be crazy not to take it.” Perhaps Blanchett and Kennedy’s can-do attitude will rub off on listeners. Their articulacy and dynamism are certainly starting to make me feel a little better. Blanchett reminds me that, for every horrible environment-attacking corporate move, there has been a pro-conservation pushback. And, after all, says Kennedy, these strange, turbulent times might shake down into a more positive future. “What if we take this opportunity of this very volatile decade and we come out the other end of it better off?” he says. “Cheap, clean energy in the hands of people, not in the hands of despot lunatics that fund wars with this stuff? What about it? That’d be nice, right?” Right!

We ask an expert","bodyText":"Aviation is the most climate-intensive form of transport, so for the sake of the planet, will we have to quit flying for ever? I asked Professor Pericles Pilidis from the Centre for Propulsion Engineering at Cranfield University whether the promise of hydrogen planes could keep our holiday hopes alive. Thanks for joining me on Zoom, Pericles. Is that a plane you have as your background? Yes! It’s a hydrogen aeroplane. Is that the one that had its successful maiden voyage in 2020, but then crashed in 2021? No, this one doesn’t exist yet but is based on detailed analysis. It looks just like a regular passenger plane. How do hydrogen planes work? They look the same but inside they’ll be very different. Currently, planes use hydrocarbon fuel. When it burns, carbon dioxide is produced, which increases global warming. But with hydrogen, you are only producing water. About 3% of the carbon humans produce comes from aviation. By humans, though, we’re really talking about people in the west. Yes, but there are global benefits to aviation. I’ve just come back from a holiday in Barbados where roughly half the economy is tourism. If people stop flying, it won’t affect Britons much, but it will have a horrific economic impact in Barbados. Don’t get me wrong, I love travelling! I think there’s a reason people say someone is “worldly” as a compliment – it’s wonderful to experience other cultures. So how long until hydrogen can give us guilt-free wings? I’d say 10 years. The problem is that hydrogen costs three to four times the price of conventional fuels. Plus, airports will have to change, because transporting hydrogen is not easy, and aircraft designs will change, too. We don’t have the rules around safety qualifications for these planes – that needs to be developed. It’ll all cost billions, and we need to do it all without using fossil fuels. There’s no point using oil to produce hydrogen. Yet all these things can be done. We’ve been making aircraft safe for 120 years: we can make hydrogen aircraft safe in 10. We just need a lot of money. Wow! I’m guessing these costs will be passed down to the consumer. I’d expect some to be, yes. But wouldn’t that be temporary? A century ago only the wealthiest could have cars. Now everyone does. New technology usually becomes cheaper If the political will is there, yes. This is somewhere national investments should come in. The UK government is spending £100bn on HS2. That’s the sort of money we need. It sounds like a lot but it’s not dissimilar to what the government’s already doing. I won’t hold my breath for such political will. They can’t even nationalise the trains even though it makes financial sense and would be popular. I’m not advocating nationalisation, but supporting private industry, like with wind and solar energy. Grants brought the cost of solar panels down, so it’s now a few per cent of what it used to be. But it’s still private companies making this happen. The difference with aerospace is that instead of buying from Germany or China like we do with solar panels, we can actually produce the engines. That’s British jobs being created. Sounds quite good, doesn’t it? It’s like having your cake and eating it, but before you can have your cake or eat it, you need to buy it first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-12T03:57:20Z","webTitle":"Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables","bodyText":"The Queensland government has granted coordinated project status to a $4.7bn proposal to build a green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Gladstone, where climate transition plans are being pitched as saviour projects. The central Queensland city has endured a significant economic downturn since the end of an LNG construction boom about five years ago. But the deputy premier, Steven Miles, says Gladstone is on the way to becoming a “clean energy powerhouse” on the back of investment in new economy and climate transition projects. Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest is already building the world’s largest electrolyser factory in Gladstone. On Tuesday the Queensland government announced a streamlined approval process, overseen by the coordinator general, for the H2-Hub Gladstone project, which will produce green hydrogen and green ammonia. The green ammonia would be sold to mining explosives manufacturer Orica, which is working with the project proponent, H2U, on plans for an ammonia export terminal in Gladstone. Miles said the project could create more than 550 jobs during a phased construction and about 140 ongoing operational jobs. The project includes plans to build up to 3 gigawatts of electrolysis and produce up to 5,000 tonnes of green ammonia a day. It would be powered by 100% renewable energy, from new-build solar and wind in Queensland. State minister for regional development and Gladstone MP, Glenn Butcher, said central Queensland was becoming a significant site for renewables projects. “These partnerships are highlighting the benefits of investing into Queensland’s regions and creating jobs for the future,” Butcher said. Green hydrogen is made by running an electric current through water using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy such as wind or solar. Energy analysts have previously suggested green hydrogen was likely to leapfrog hydrogen made with gas and coal as the most cost-effective form of the energy before the end of the decade, and by the time an industry could be developed at scale. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hydrogen has become central to the Australian government’s current proposal to reach net zero emissions. The government has nominated “clean hydrogen” as a priority low-emissions technology that could eventually help replace fossil fuels in transport, electricity and industrial processes as the world moves to cut greenhouse gas emissions. H2U is expected to make a final investment decision by mid-2023, with operations expected to begin in 2025 and an expansion toward the end of the decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-11T18:04:06Z","webTitle":"BlackRock urged to delay debt repayments from crisis-torn Zambia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","fields":{"headline":"BlackRock urged to delay debt repayments from crisis-torn Zambia","bodyText":"BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, has come under pressure to delay demands for debt interest payments from Zambia to prevent the crisis-hit African country’s finances from spiralling out of control. Anti-poverty campaigners said BlackRock, which manages $10tn (£7.68tn) of assets, was among the private sector lenders that had refused to reduce the interest rate or delay payments on Zambian bonds, unlike governments and international agencies that hold the country’s debts. The charity Jubilee Debt Campaign said it estimated the asset manager, which holds $220m of Zambian sovereign bonds, could generate $180m for clients, mostly in its index-linked exchange-traded funds, if the debts were paid in full. “This would represent a 110% profit on what we estimate BlackRock paid for the debt,” the charity said. Zambia, which has cut health and social care spending by a fifth in the past two years to balance its budget, has seen its debts soar in recent years to fund infrastructure projects, many to help the country supplement drought-affected hydropower plants. Solar energy projects have made the country almost self-sufficient in electricity, but the high cost of borrowing and the Covid crisis has crippled the country’s finances. Further loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been tied to commitments to end fuel subsidies to households and businesses, pushing the inflation rate above 20% last year. Of Zambia’s external debt, 46% is owed to private lenders, 22% to China, 8% to other governments and 18% to multilateral institutions. China is among the government lenders to agree a longer debt repayment schedule that private lenders, including banks, have so far resisted, the Jubilee Debt campaign said. The Zambian government has already defaulted on loans from commercial lenders and could default on further loans, risking it becoming a pariah on international debt markets. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the charity estimates Zambia’s bonds have had an average face value of 59 cents on the dollar, and the average interest rate on its bonds is 8.1%. The southern African country applied for a new G20 debt relief scheme at the start of 2021 but has not yet had any debt cancelled. Tim Jones, the Jubilee Debt Campaign’s head of policy, said BlackRock had bought Zambian bonds at rock-bottom prices when it was clear the country was already in trouble. He said: “It is unfair for BlackRock and other lenders to make massive profits out of Zambia’s debt crisis. If BlackRock refuses to cancel Zambia’s debt, then the UK and other G20 countries should support Zambia to stay in default on BlackRock.” Isaac Mwaipopo, a member of the Zambia Civil Society Debt Alliance, said: “Zambia’s debt crisis is preventing people getting access to healthcare, education and other social services. “We urgently need all of Zambia’s lenders, including BlackRock, to agree to cancel debt so we can recover from the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis we face. Loans were given at high interest rates, and have been trading at low prices, so it is only fair lenders agree significant debt cancellation, rather than making mass profit out of the Zambian people.” Negotiations on the debt restructuring are due to take place later this month. G20 finance ministers are scheduled to meet on 20 April, during the IMF spring meetings, to discuss the progress of the debt relief scheme, known as the common framework. Zambia, Chad and Ethiopia applied last year for debt relief under the common framework, which the IMF said has yet to be agreed, partly because it requires private creditors to participate “on comparable terms to overcome collective action challenges and ensure fair burden sharing”. A BlackRock spokesperson disputed the charity’s estimates of potential gains, saying there had not been any significant increases in the firm’s holdings of Zambian debt since September 2020 “other than as required to ensure the funds remain near or at the benchmark”. They added: “The money invested in bonds by asset managers is predominantly the money of ordinary people saving for retirement. None of the money is the asset manager’s. Any decision on restructuring these bonds must therefore be balanced against the duty of the asset manager to protect the savings of the millions of people whose money was lent to these countries, while at the same time recognising the difficult circumstances they are facing from the challenges posed by Covid-19. The spokesperson said the firm had “no discretion” to sell bonds held in index funds, “so it is in our clients’ interests for these countries to thrive and succeed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-09T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"‘Firms will go bust’: Germany prepares for a future without Russian gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"‘Firms will go bust’: Germany prepares for a future without Russian gas","bodyText":"In Germany, they call it “Day X”. Businesses up and down the land are making contingency plans for what is seen as a growing likelihood that Russian gas will stop flowing into Europe’s biggest economy. “It would be a disaster – one which would have seemed almost unthinkable just two months ago, but which right now feels like a very realistic prospect,” the owner of a hi-tech mechanical engineering company in western Germany said. The firm produces everything from battery cases for electric cars to train clutch systems. The speaker did not want to be named, or for his company to be identified, in part for fear, he said, of appearing to support Russia’s war by making the case that if the gas is turned off, his century-old business “will likely not survive”. But he says he is in a deep quandary and feeling very vulnerable, as he is not only heavily reliant on gas – the cost of which has already soared – but also on metals such as nickel and aluminium, much of which comes from Russia. Germany gets around 50bn cubic metres a year or 55% of its gas from Russia, the largest by volume of any EU country, and by extension, the biggest share of any large European economy. Two possible, not unlikely scenarios are being mooted: one envisages Moscow deciding to cut off or reduce supplies in retaliation for sanctions; the other sees Germany giving in to mounting pressure to support an EU energy embargo according to which the recipients would effectively call Putin’s bluff by cutting themselves off from Russian supplies. On Friday at the Brandenburg Gate, protesters in favour of an oil and gas embargo made their point for the moral argument, with 410 red lights commemorating the victims of Russian army killings in the town of Bucha, alongside slogans asking German chancellor Olaf Scholz: “If not now, when?” Their message is stark. As long as German industry keeps taking the energy – for which it pays Moscow €200m (£167m) every day – it is helping fund the atrocities. But industry bosses and political leaders have warned that the damage to Germany by turning off the taps would be far greater than any benefit it brings to Ukraine. “What use to anybody is a weakened Germany?” a source close to the government told the Guardian this week. Millions of private homes without heat is just one part of the picture. The other, arguably bigger concern, are the manufacturing giants, dependent on gas to operate, such as Thyssenkrupp, BASF and Bayer. And the hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses with which they are interlinked. Industry representatives have warned that the effects would be felt in every product from construction material, synthetics, pesticides, disinfectant, packaging and semiconductors to the production of antibiotics, coronavirus vaccines and cancer drugs. The chain reaction is difficult to predict but likely to be considerable. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has urged Germans to “turn down the thermostat” – saying that “every kilowatt hour that Germany saves harms Putin” – what some have cynically dubbed “freezing for Ukraine”. Industry too is being urged to scale back its use. Some have done so already, forced by the high energy costs. Others, such as the porcelain manufacturer KPM, founded in 1763, are working overtime to produce as many goods as possible before the taps are turned off. “Who knows for how long we will have gas?” its CEO, Martina Hacker, told Der Spiegel. “We can’t produce porcelain without it.” Other companies have reduced production to a minimum. But industries such as glass manufacturers say shutting down production facilities altogether is not an option as it would cause liquids to set and destroy the machines. The country’s 45 gas storage facilities are only about 26% full. The plan is to increase levels to 80% by the autumn, largely by saving energy now, in order to safeguard supplies for next winter. Habeck triggered the first part of a three-point emergency plan last week that anticipates a slow-down or halt of gas and decides where supplies would go. Hospitals, emergency services and medical manufacturers would be prioritised, followed by private households. Industries, which use a quarter of the gas delivered to Germany would be the first expected to shut down, according to the plan. Which is why businesses are being asked to put forward their arguments as to how “system relevant” they are. Law firms have been flooded with queries from companies wanting to know their legal standing, while industrial associations report being inundated with queries by members asking where they rank in the pecking order and how they should react to the uncertainty. One representative said: “We have glass manufacturers saying they are system relevant because they provide the medical industry with glass vials, paper manufacturers, arguing that their corrugated cardboard is vital for the safe transport of the vials. How do you possibly argue against them?” The Federal Network Agency, which ensures fair access to gas, electricity and other vital services, has sent a questionnaire to all German businesses, asking them to effectively set out their individual arguments for a right to gas. “The question of prioritisation is a very difficult decision, requiring consideration of a wide range of consequences,” said a spokesperson for the economics ministry. Some predict an ugly battle over who deserves the energy most. There are doomsday visions of supply chains – already under pressure due to the pandemic – collapsing altogether, businesses forced into bankruptcy, mass unemployment. Jörg Hoffmann, the head of IG Metall, a union that represents 1.2 million workers in the chemical, metal processing and food production, has warned of “a recession deeper than any of the recessions we have known until now.” BASF, the chemical giant, and one of Germany’s biggest single purchasers and consumers of energy, said the effect of its production downturn would soon be felt. “We would get very high unemployment, many firms would go bust,” the BASF chairman, Martin Brudermüller, has said. “It would lead to irreversible damage. To put it bluntly: it could lead Germany into its most serious crisis since the end of the second world war, and destroy our prosperity.” A race against time is on to find alternative gas source supplies from the Netherlands and Norway and increase liquid natural gas (LNG) supplies from Belgian terminals and the US. Habeck has been to Qatar to secure further shipments and has ordered the construction of LNG carriers to float in German ports rather than wait for the construction of proposed new LNG terminals, which will take too long. The abolition of coal-fired plants – seen as a central part of the climate emergency plan – may yet be delayed. The pressure is on to scale up and speed up renewable projects in wind and solar. Companies such as the pharmacy giant Merck are making their own plans to build wind turbines and solar energy panels to increase their independence – if only to be able to heat their offices. But it is a gargantuan effort that will probably take years and in the meantime Germany is left looking extremely vulnerable. Some companies are even contemplating moving their production facilities abroad, predicting that operating in Germany will become prohibitively expensive and triggering fears Europe’s economic motor is in danger of losing its competitive edge. While Habeck believes Germany is in a position to wean itself off Russian gas in around two years’ time, Brudermüller believes four to five years is more realistic. Some experts say by the end of the decade is more likely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/09/latest-ipcc-report-offers-key-lessons-for-australia-but-is-anyone-listening","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-08T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Latest IPCC report offers key lessons for Australia but is anyone listening?

With the unofficial election campaign under way, and the prime minister mired in escalating allegations of bullying and duplicity, a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world’s most respected climate science body – quickly disappeared from the Australian news cycle this week. The report, the third major release from the IPCC’s sixth assessment of the published evidence, focused on greenhouse gas emissions cuts – what has happened to date and what is necessary from here. Headlines told part of the story: it was “now or never” if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The report suggests that threshold is already practically out of reach without using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky. Keeping heating below 2C, which would trigger damage several magnitudes worse than 1.5C, will require an “abrupt acceleration” of effort after 2030. In a sane world, this alone may be enough to make it a focus of political discussion, now and through the election. But there was much more. The report suggests a rapid reduction in emissions over the next decade is within the world’s grasp – if leaders, policymakers and investors are motivated. Here are some key lessons relevant to Australia. We have the technology Any suggestion there isn’t technology that could deliver deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions this decade – as scientists and leaders at UN climate talks have repeatedly said is necessary – should be dispelled by this report. This is a key point in Australia given the Morrison government’s “technology, not taxes” mantra. The Coalition’s focus is on supporting technologies that are not yet commercially viable with an expectation they will deliver cuts mostly after 2030 and closer to 2050. It rejects calls for policies to rapidly deploy clean technology now, equating them to “taxes’’ that increase costs. The IPCC report tells a different story. It takes a global view and is not policy prescriptive, but says there are options available to cut emissions across all areas that already make economic sense. In several cases it suggests they would cost less than continuing with the polluting status quo. As the Australian National University’s Prof Frank Jotzo, a lead author on the report, spelled out this week, the IPCC found global emissions could be cut by 50% by 2030 through affordable steps. Jotzo says the general findings of the report are “very readily applied to Australia”. Solar and wind power are the obvious cases. Their average costs fell by 85% and 55% respectively in the decade to 2019. The IPCC estimates building a lot more of both could cut emissions by about 5bn tonnes a year – nearly 10% of the global total – by 2030 while saving governments and consumers money compared with the alternative. They could deliver nearly 3bn tonnes more for a relatively low cost. The ramifications for Australia are potentially significant. Compared with nearly every other country, it has vast amounts of sun and wind and no shortage of space in which to harness them. The IPCC implicitly supports the idea that there is a strong economic argument to quickly boost renewable energy deployment beyond the current pace of expansion as part of a campaign to “electrify everything”, including transport, farms and major industry. The report lists other options that could lead to cuts that were either cheaper than what we have now or would cost relatively little. Programs that reduce demand for energy are a big one – they save money. Other familiar ideas that could be accelerated include improving buildings’ and industry’s energy efficiency, boosting carbon sequestration in agriculture and stopping native forest clearing. Other cheap options are yet to get much traction in Australia at the federal level. Transport is a big one. The IPCC’s data suggests shifting to more fuel-efficient cars and trucks and relying more on public transport, bikes and e-bikes makes economic sense and is good for the planet. These aren’t revolutionary ideas, just ones that have been resisted until now. On fue- efficient cars, the Coalition planned a policy that would have required a reduction in average emissions from the national car fleet – basically, forcing auto companies to sell cleaner cars – but dropped it after industry and internal pushback, despite receiving advice it could benefit the economy by up to $13.9bn. It is part of the reason the Australian car fleet remains dirtier than other comparable countries and the country trails most others in embracing electric vehicles. Yes, fossil fuels are still the problem Despite persistent claims to the contrary from industry and fossil fuel-friendly MPs, the IPCC makes it clear that promotion of coal and gas – a favourite pastime of Australian politicians – is making it harder to keep global heating to 1.5C. The basic argument is straightforward: if existing fossil fuel plants run for their expected lifetimes, the world will blow the carbon budget to keep the temperature rise below that level. New developments only add to that. To keep the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement within reach, countries should embark on a dedicated effort to decommission, cut back and cancel fossil fuel projects – or be prepared to spend even more on nascent technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In reality, both are likely to be needed. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, thundered this point as the report was released, describing investments in new fossil fuel projects as “moral and economic madness”, and that countries that were increasing fossil fuel production – not activists – were “the truly dangerous radicals” on climate change. He didn’t name Australia this time – that was last month when he called it a “holdout” on climate change for refusing to strengthen 2030 emissions reduction targets – but the message was clear. The Morrison government has not been swayed. It is backing a “gas-fired recovery”, including opening up new basins with the potential to release extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas, as vital for the country’s future after the pandemic. Labor does not oppose the expansion. Scott Morrison has also declared the country’s coal plants should run for “as long as they possibly can” and the resources minister, Keith Pitt, cheered a recent surge in coal and gas demand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Australia is the world’s third-biggest fossil fuel exporter, with government economic forecasts suggesting it will export more than 200m tonnes of thermal coal and about 80m tonnes of gas each year between now and 2027. The government argues there is no need to change this until demand dries up. It says developing countries need coal and gas to grow, that gas reduces emissions overseas by replacing coal (no evidence supplied) and that the focus should be on steps that give fossil fuels a future in a low-emissions world, including developing technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and “blue” hydrogen made with gas. But the IPCC suggests supporting continued use of fossil fuels overseas can lock in polluting energy sources that are increasingly more expensive than renewables. And attempting to add CCS to fossil fuel energy just makes it even more expensive. Little evidence CCS will play a major role This is a big one in Australia, where governments have committed more than $4bn to try to make the technology viable. The Morrison government has kicked in hundreds of millions. The IPCC makes clear CCS – stopping emissions going into the atmosphere, usually by burying them underground – will have to prove economically viable for fossil fuels to have a future in a world that keeps heating below 2C. Despite having targets that assume more than 3C of warming, Australia is notionally committed to this. One of the government’s “stretch goals” under its technology investment roadmap is to get the cost of CCS to under $20 per tonne of emissions. The IPCC report suggests this remains a long way off. A table on the likely average cost of technologies available this decade puts CCS among the most expensive. The science body has revised down its assessment of how much of global electricity it expects to come from fossil fuels with CCS in 2040 since the last time it reported from 5% to 3%. The report says polluting industries want CCS to work as it could “allow fossil fuels to be used longer”, reducing the likelihood of assets becoming stranded. But despite having been promised for decades, and having had billions of dollars in funding committed to it in Australia alone, CCS still only captures about 0.3% of the 34.6bn tonnes of annual global emissions released burning fossil fuels. It makes a difference when we act This one shouldn’t be overstated, for obvious enough reasons. Global emissions continue to rise, though the pace has slowed since 2010. But there is evidence that serious efforts to cut emissions work. In 2016, steps such as accelerating available technology, backing energy efficiency and slowing deforestation lowered the global total by 5.9bn tonnes. That’s about a 10% cut. The report says at least 24 countries have cut emissions in absolute terms over at least a decade. The problem is that these cuts are outweighed by rapid growth elsewhere. In Australia, the government points to evidence that national emissions are down about 20% since 2005 – and has called on other countries to “follow our leadership” – but the headline number relies on greenhouse accounting sleights of hand that mask the reality. Fossil fuel emissions – the main game – were rising before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit due to increases from transport, mining and major industry. Government projections suggest those sectors will do little to reduce their impact before 2030. The claimed reduction since 2005 mostly happened when Labor was in power, between 2007 and 2013. Even then, it was mostly due to state policies that slowed the country’s extraordinary pace of forest destruction for agriculture, particularly in Queensland. Australia is still clearing native forests, just at a slower pace. Under greenhouse accounting, that counts as a cut in annual emissions. But it is not evidence of a country transforming its economy. The IPCC report suggests there is another way ahead.

","bodyText":"Amid the triple crisis of the war in Ukraine, the still-raging pandemic and escalating inflation, climate scientists have just pulled off a truly impressive achievement. They have stood firm and persuaded the world’s governments to agree to a common guide to solving the climate emergency. Despite the despair of mounting global problems, the release of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows some grounds for hope. After the recent reports on the causes and effects of climate change, this one covers solutions – with a summary signed off by the world’s governments. The summary is blunt and clear, and in many places acknowledges realities that scientists and campaigners have known for years but governments often avoided directly admitting. First, it is clearly acknowledged that North America and Europe have made the greatest contribution to the crisis we are living through, by producing by far the most carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. The report shows that today the average North American emits 16 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year from fossil fuel use, compared to just 2 tonnes for the average African. Consumption by the top 10% of households comprises over a third of global of greenhouse gases, compared to 15% of these gases for the bottom 50% of households. Every government now agrees that the climate crisis is driven by how the world’s wealthy – which includes much of the UK’s population – currently live, consume and invest. This is a major leap forward compared to previous reports. The last IPCC summary on solutions in 2014 labelled population growth as one of “the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”. Such dangerous misunderstandings are no longer present in the summary report. Seven years on, these old “blame the poor” arguments increasingly seem like a relic of a previous age. The new report is also admirably clear on how far governments are from meeting their commitments signed under the Paris agreement in 2015 and reaffirmed in Glasgow late last year. For all the UK government’s talk of “keeping 1.5 alive” in Glasgow, current climate policies and pledges will not limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, or keep it “well below” 2C, the dual Paris targets. Despite the the complexities of climate science, our course is terrifyingly simple to see: we are currently on track for catastrophic 3C heating. In a world where half of the its population is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis, that spells disaster. Extreme heatwaves, floods and droughts far outside the normal tolerances of cities and towns will destroy lives and livelihoods globally. The knock-on effects of crop failures, migration and economic disruption could then overload political institutions and our abilities to respond to unfolding events. If that feels depressing, there is cause for hope. Governments own this report. They have endorsed it, and they have signed it off. Their citizens can now hold them to account for the failures it details. The most heartening section of the report is on alternatives to fossil fuel use. The overarching solution to our energy needs is to electrify everything we can, from heating buildings to transport, and power everything using clean renewables and storage. We are getting a huge helping hand from great leaps forward in clean technology. Between 2010 and 2019, the report says that the cost of solar energy plummeted by 85%, wind energy by 55% and lithium-ion batteries by 85%. These are staggering figures that point to a radically reshaped energy future. With the tsunami of suffering that is about to engulf UK households from soaring energy costs set by skyrocketing gas prices, everyone in government needs to see this message. There is a cheaper, cleaner way. But the emissions problem is deeper than just failures to invest in low-carbon alternatives. The world already has enough existing and planned high-carbon infrastructure to blast past 1.5C. Retiring big emitters, such as coal-fired power stations, is needed. Plus, planned new oil fields and airports that lock in high emissions need cancelling. This report is essentially a manifesto for ending the fossil fuel age. It will help the growing mass of people fighting against the fossil fuel industry on many fronts – but especially those taking official channels, such as MPs lobbying government not to open new oil fields, lawyers and citizens taking countries or companies to court, or those justifying direct action to stop high-carbon infrastructure being built. The licence for climate action has never been stronger. There are also elements in the report that will be used by the fossil fuel industry to further delay climate action. Central to this is the discussion of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those who bank on business-as-usual will argue that later this century we will be able to suck carbon out of the air, so why bother cutting emissions as sharply as possible today? The answer, in the report, is that carbon removal “currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and sociocultural barriers”. The report rightly says that some carbon removal is needed, but it should never be an alternative to cutting emissions now. It makes clear how unrealistic very high carbon removal pathways are, in stronger terms than ever before. For those who have been working for a better climate, the full 3,000-page report contains an astonishingly frank assessment of the organised efforts used to thwart climate action, noting: “opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries is broad-based, highly organized, and matched with extensive lobbying”. It may seem ironic that this doesn’t make it into the much more widely read summary, but it is perhaps not surprising. The intertwined relationship between fossil fuels and governments goes deep: last week, for example, we learned that the former UK boss of BP is to be appointed by the government to champion the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Each year that passes adds further reasons to stop using fossil fuels. Last year, it became clear that gas prices would rise sharply, affecting millions. This year, we can add that fossil fuels fund the Russian military and its atrocities. Add these to ending urban air pollution and avoiding hundreds of millions of people suffering heatwaves, drought and floods. And the price? Investing a few per cent of GDP and some new legislation. Climate change can feel complex, but the IPCC has worked hard to make it simple for us. A path still exists to halve emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050, which will probably meet the 1.5C goal. It is a hopeful message. The task now is to make it real. • This article was amended on 18 May 2022 to clarify that population is not discussed in the 2022 summary report, but is discussed in the main report.

The energy security strategy to be unveiled on Thursday will acknowledge the need to move away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands, but still allow for licences to explore new oil and gas fields to be expedited and more production from existing North Sea fields. Ministers are expected to say the UK needs more oil and gas in the short term, including new sources of fossil fuel imports, to replace the small proportion of UK oil and gas that comes from Russia, and ease pressure on prices. The government will present North Sea oil and gas as lower carbon than imported gas, according to a Whitehall source, to meet the UK’s needs while ramping up renewables and nuclear power. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a “now or never” warning on Monday, showing that new fossil fuel exploration will put the Paris agreement target of limiting global heating to 1.5C beyond reach. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will present the energy strategy, is strongly in favour of ramping up renewable energy over oil and gas, but under pressure from Tory rightwingers the government is set to offer a heavy emphasis on gas, with few measures on insulation or switching to heat pumps. The strategy will also set out: A review of the scientific advice on the safety of fracking. The Guardian understands that Kwarteng thinks fracking in the UK is unrealistic and uneconomic, but under pressure from the right will keep the option open. Doubling the target on the use of hydrogen, from 5GW to 10GW, of which half will come from “blue” hydrogen created from fossil fuels, despite evidence that it emits more carbon than coal. Ministers are expected to present blue hydrogen as a necessary bridge to future “green” hydrogen from renewable energy, but campaigners say it will lock in high emissions. A boost to offshore wind, with the expansion of existing coastal offshore windfarms and potential new floating platforms in deeper waters, but solar energy risks being missed. Investment in new nuclear reactors being made easier. Few new measures on ramping up heat pumps and no comprehensive national programme to insulate housing on the scale experts say is feasible and would make a real difference to the cost of living. Hopes for a major loosening of planning regulations in England that would allow more onshore wind will be dashed, owing to cabinet opposition. This is despite multiple opinion polls showing a large majority of people in favour of windfarms, including most Conservative voters and people in areas near actual and proposed turbines. Green campaigners said new North Sea fields licensed today would produce no gas for years or decades but result in continued higher emissions long into the future. Meanwhile, the bigger opportunity – of cutting energy waste – risks being missed. The government’s independent climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has expressed its strong disapproval of plans for more extraction in the North Sea, but said last month it was powerless to prevent it. Philip Evans, oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Rushing to sign off new fossil fuel licences that’ll take decades to get going would be no help in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and would actively make the climate crisis worse. The quickest and smartest solution to the energy challenge and the cost of living crisis is a huge push to tackle energy waste. If your bathtub is leaking, you should fix the leak – not just turn up the taps.” Fixing the leaks seems to be low down on the government’s priority list, however. Successive attempts to insulate Britain have failed, for various reasons: poor administration, in last year’s disastrous green homes grant; complex rules and low incentives for its predecessor “green deal” scheme that was abandoned in 2015; and overall a half-hearted, short-term and piecemeal approach from the government. Experts say what is needed is a concerted nationwide push to roll out insulation, double glazing and heat pumps, concentrating first on households in or at risk of energy poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said: “The benefits of making our homes energy efficient are so overwhelming that nobody seriously disagrees with its importance, but as a country our efforts so far have got nowhere near the scale required. Now is surely the time to press ahead with something that is proven to [reduce bills] by hundreds of pounds a year permanently.” There is little sense that the government is prepared to put in the large-scale effort required. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G, warned: “There is technical potential to halve gas consumption in UK homes. But to realise that extraordinary potential means unleashing a new wave of public investment to help every household to make their home super energy efficient. This requires a wartime effort to build up an army of installers to insulate our homes and fit heat pumps and to ensure it is affordable for everyone.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 terawatt-hours of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Behaviour change is also out of favour. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has urged people to turn down their thermostats by just 1C, from about 22C on average to 21C – which is still at the upper end of comfortable. But the government is reluctant to call on people to do anything that could be regarded as a sacrifice. Another area of concern is solar power. Offshore wind – Boris Johnson’s favourite form of renewable energy – will get a big boost in the strategy, but solar could lose out despite being the cheapest form of power in the UK and the fastest to get up and running, according to Chris Hewett, chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK. He said the UK could reach 54GW capacity for solar power by 2030 – about 17% of the UK’s electricity needs – with the right backing. Plans for some large solar farms have run into opposition, and solar panels are still expensive for most households, despite the removal of VAT on panels. Hewett said: “To unlock the full potential, we need to see the government setting an ambitious target and speeding up investment in the modernisation of our power networks. Supportive planning guidance and a formal recognition that land within a solar farm is frequently used for agriculture or to enhance biodiversity would also enable solar to play an important role in rural economies.” The Guardian understands there are no plans for the government to seek “wriggle room” on missing or delaying the UK’s carbon budgets or legally binding net zero target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T17:49:51Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster","bodyText":"The continued heating of the planet means that this year will probably be one of this century’s coolest. As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes clear, current climate pledges by governments would not keep global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – the target promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Instead greenhouse gas emissions are rising. During the past decade, on average annually they were at their highest levels in human history. The world is on a pathway to temperature increases of more than 3C in the coming decades. This would make large parts of the world too hot to work in. Severe harvest failures will become common. Disappearing ice caps would submerge major cities. Governments have hitherto been far too hesitant to take on vested interests and are all too ready to protect historic investments in fossil fuels. This cannot go on. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was right to say that the world “was on a fast track to climate disaster”. Nations and corporations, he candidly said, are not just turning a blind eye to a planetary disaster but adding fuel to the flames. There is very little time left to implement policies that promote the needed greener lifestyle choices and cheaper renewable solutions that would generate jobs, energy security and price stability. To achieve 1.5C, the world must reduce annual CO2 emissions by about 50% by 2030, and reach net zero by 2050, while reducing methane emissions a third by 2030 and almost halving them by 2050. This will need deep cuts in fossil fuel use. The IPCC says the case is unanswerable for widespread electrification – especially crucial for enabling the decarbonisation of road transport, industry, mining and manufacturing – powered by renewable sources. The UN’s scientists argue that energy efficiency and conservation are central to achieving a greener, safer future. There are some success stories: at least 18 countries have sustained production-based greenhouse gas and consumption-based carbon dioxide emission reductions for longer than a decade. Much of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere was released by rich countries that burned coal, oil and gas to industrialise more than a century ago. The UN panel said about 40% of emissions since then came from Europe and North America. Only about 12% can be attributed to east Asia, including China. It is in the wealthiest 10% of households, which contribute between a third and 45% of climate-changing fumes, where change will have to happen fastest. There are some quick policy wins. Better crop management has an immediate payback. Solar energy and wind energy improve faster and are adopted quicker than nuclear or carbon capture technologies. Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions and are increasingly popular. It is likely that global temperatures will “overshoot” the 1.5C pledged by the Paris agreement. Even under one of the least bad scenarios, the IPCC says that temporarily exceeding this limit by a tiny 0.2C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by the century’s end could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs. The pandemic was an opportunity to make the rapid shift required away from fossil fuels and was missed by most governments. Russia’s immoral war in Ukraine offers another chance for nations concerned about overreliance on hydrocarbons to do the right thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply | Frank Jotzo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","fields":{"headline":"We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply","bodyText":"Enormous opportunities to cut emissions deeply are there, the time to act is now, and it can be done at affordable cost. That would be the shortest possible summary of the thousands of pages of careful assessment in the world’s definitive stocktake of how to limit future climate change. The assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change implies that while limiting global warming to 1.5C is practically out of reach, staying below 2C is possible in practice. And it is no longer just a theoretical possibility as it used to be not too long ago. The IPCC finds that the world’s emissions could be cut in half by 2030 at affordable costs if action is taken right across the board. Of this, 50% could be achieved at relatively low costs of less than US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, or even with net economic gains. And that is before taking into account the massive benefits from reducing future climate change, and benefits such as cleaner air and better energy supply security. The dramatic reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies over recent years are a gamechanger; for example, the cost of solar energy has reduced sixfold over just a decade. Positive experiences in the implementation of policies to cut emissions are another reason for optimism. So while the urgency to take action has risen, the opportunities to really make a difference are also much greater. The energy and land sectors are the largest opportunities globally. In energy, the story is about solar and wind power displacing fossil fuels, alongside many other ways of cutting emissions. On the land, it is about reforestation and avoided deforestation, better land management, and a shift to low-emissions agriculture. Industry, transport and buildings are also crucial parts of the puzzle. The IPCC also shows that shifts in consumption habits, including changing diets, are also important. Australia is in pole position on all of these. Ours is a high-emissions economy, which means that it is relatively easy to make big cuts. Add to that Australia’s advantage of a practically unlimited low-cost supply of renewable energy and huge opportunities for better carbon management on the land. But the transition will, of course, also bring its challenges, including for Australia. Fossil fuel use declines dramatically in scenarios of strong global climate action. Coal in particular will be on the way out, with the IPCC projecting reductions of 65% to 95% in global coal use by 2050 in 2C scenarios. The numbers for reductions in gas vary greatly between scenarios, and depend heavily on how far below 2C the world may get. How to get there in practice? For implementation of climate policy, this IPCC report assesses practical experience, not theory or modelling. The picture that emerges is a very positive one: the world over, climate laws and policies are on the ascendancy, and most measures that governments have taken are effective. Experience has helped refine policies so they also meet other goals. For example, carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes are routinely designed so that low-income groups are protected from adverse financial impacts, by channelling some of the revenue to them. The IPCC finds that packages of policies are the best way to achieve emissions outcomes. Economic instruments like pricing policies then link up with more specific regulatory policies, and are complemented by support for research and development, regional transition and so forth. While the IPCC does not provide country-specific assessments, the implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy. What we need is a comprehensive set of policies that guides and incentivises the shift to a net zero economy right across the board. This is what will make the needed investment flow. And climate policy should not be the domain of governments and business alone. The IPCC report finds that to achieve the shift that is needed, climate action must involve civil society. Whether it is unions, NGOs, grassroots organisations, the research sector or business associations, all need to be on board and pull in the same general direction. At this point in the electoral cycle, a question often asked is: what are the implications of the election outcome for climate policy? In the picture that arises from the IPCC report, this should not be a question that needs asking. In a world where addressing climate change is done properly, climate policy is not a question of politics. Rather, it would be a shared fundamental objective – just like national security, decent infrastructure or a well-functioning health and education system.

Environmentalists are decrying the measure, arguing that the expansion of rooftop solar is a necessary step in the fight against the climate crisis. The bill was passed in Florida, as another extremely sunny state, California, considered a similar update to its solar policies. “This is a bill that basically erases the only pro-solar policy in Florida,” said Heaven Campbell, state program director of the non-profit Solar United Neighbors. The new legislation in Florida would impact a policy known as net metering, through which solar power users who sell excess energy back to the grid in exchange for a billing credit. If signed into law, HB-741 would cut this incentives for rooftop solar owners, and allow utilities to charge fees that would raise the cost of switching to renewable energy. During the day, solar panels can produce energy beyond what is needed to power a home. Under the current net metering policy, the billing credits earned by solar users are applied to energy used at night or when it’s cloudy. They can also offset costs of installing rooftop solar. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Jennifer Bradley and Representative Lawrence McClure, would allow utility companies to “recover its lost revenues” from customers and, starting 2024, the rate of reimbursement would decline for new solar-panel owners. Critics of the bill warn that it would halt the growth of solar industry in the state and reinforce Florida’s dependency on fossil fuels. Roughly 90,000 customers or about 1% of all customers across the state have rooftop solar. Florida is the second-largest producer of electricity in the nation after Texas, with 75% of its in-state electricity coming from natural gas. Records obtained by Miami Herald and Floodlight reveal that Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) state’s largest power utility, had drafted the bill. FPL’s parent company also made a $10,000 contribution to Sen. Bradley’s political committee, bringing to question the impartiality of this legislation. FPL’s parent company has said that the contribution was not made “with the expectation of favor”. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We’ve been engaged in constructive dialogue with numerous lawmakers regarding this important issue. Ultimately, lawmakers decide the exact language that will be included in a bill.” In response to the Miami Herald and Floodlight’s investigation last year, a spokesperson for FPL said the utility does not oppose net metering, but that “we simply believe rooftop solar customers should pay the full cost of this investment”. Supporters of the bill largely view net-metering as a financial burden to non-solar customers. When introducing the bill on 11 January Bradley argued that under the current policy, people who can’t afford solar panels are subsidizing the cost for those who can. However, filings by FPL and Gulf Power Company show that 67 and 59% of their net metered customers respectively are low-to-moderate income, with most homeowners financing rooftop solar through loans. The bill would require customers with solar to “pay the full cost of electric service” and not be “subsidized by the public utility’s general body of ratepayers”. But with such a small number of rooftop solar owners in the state, critics wonder if this is the case of utility companies claiming a monopoly on solar. “It’s becoming more and more clear that FPL views all solar that happens outside of their control as not just lost revenue, but a lost opportunity for ownership,” Campbell said. FPL has 50 solar farms across the state, and is acquiring more land to install 30m solar panels by 2025. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We believe our customers and our state benefit the most when the largest amount of solar is installed at the lowest cost. Large-scale, universal solar is the fastest, most cost-effective way for us to bring more solar to Florida, while keeping bills low for customers over the long term.” Another potential revision to net metering is underway in California, the nation’s leading solar power state. The state utility commission proposed reducing subsidy rates for rooftop solar and adding a monthly charge for new solar owners. Some environmentalists have supported changes to California’s net metering policy, calling them “cost-effective and equitable”. As is the case in Florida, the California proposal is backed by the state’s utility companies Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. In 2016, following similar net-metering legislation in Nevada, many solar companies ceased their business in the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-26T08:00:52Z","webTitle":"Energy efficiency guru Amory Lovins: ‘It’s the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest way to address the crisis’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Energy efficiency guru Amory Lovins: ‘It’s the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest way to address the crisis’","bodyText":"Temperatures dropped far below freezing this week in Snowmass, Colorado. But Amory Lovins, who lives high up in the mountains at 7,200ft above sea level, did not even turn on the heating. That’s because he has no heating to turn on. His home, a great adobe and glass mountainside eyrie that he designed in the 1980s, collects solar energy and is so well insulated that he grows and harvests bananas and many other tropical fruits there without burning gas, oil or wood. Nicknamed the “Einstein of energy efficiency”, Lovins, an adjunct professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, has been one of the world’s leading advocates and innovators of energy conservation for 50 years. He wrote his first paper on climate change while at Oxford in 1968, and in 1976 he offered Jimmy Carter’s government a blueprint for how to triple energy efficiency and get off oil and coal within 40 years. In the years since there is barely a major industry or government that he and his Rocky Mountain Institute have not advised. But for much of that time efficiency was seen as a bit of an ugly sister, rather dull compared with a massive transition to renewables and other new technologies. Now, he hopes, its time may have come. Lovins is arguing for the mass insulation of buildings alongside a vast acceleration of renewables. “We should crank [them] up with wartime urgency. There should be far more emphasis on efficiency,” he says. He sees Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as an outrage, but possibly also a step towards solving the climate crisis and a way to save trillions of dollars. “He has managed to bring about all the outcomes that he most feared, but he may inadvertently have put the energy transition and climate solutions into a higher gear. Whether or not we end up in a recession because of the disruption, [Putin’s war] may prove to be a great thing for climate economics.” As it happens, Lovins has family connections to Ukraine: all four of his grandparents were early 20th-century immigrants from small villages between Kyiv and Odesa. He has one relative left there; the rest, as far as he knows, were murdered in the 1941 massacre of Tarashcha, when a Jewish population of nearly 14,000 was slaughtered by the Nazis, leaving just 11 people who happened to be off in the woods gathering mushrooms that day. “Solar and wind are now the cheapest bulk power sources in 91% of the world, and the UN’s International Energy Agency (IEA) expects renewables to generate 90% of all new power in the coming years. The energy revolution has happened. Sorry if you missed it,” he says. But just as with the 1970s oil shocks, the problem today is not where to find energy but how to use it better, he says. The answer is what he calls “integrative, or whole-system, design,” a way to employ orthodox engineering to achieve radically more energy-efficient results by changing the design logic. Take his house, he says. By designing it to collect energy and to need no heating, it saves 99% of the space- and water-heating energy, and 90% of the electricity. “And it’s cheaper to build and saves construction costs,” he adds. “It turns out that if you make [a] car out of carbon fibre, you also save two-thirds of the investment in water and half the energy space and time needed to put the car together. And it needs a lot fewer batteries because it’s holding less weight because the carbon fibre is light. You pay for the carbon fibre by needing fewer batteries and smaller propulsion system all round. “So if you do this across the whole economy, really designing whole systems in factories, equipment, buildings, vehicles, you’ll end up with severalfold larger energy savings than practically anyone now thinks is available. And the cost goes down.” So far, this integrative design approach has been mostly adopted by the private sector. Walmart, the world’s largest truck operator, improved its energy efficiency by nearly 40% by rethinking its operation. Other retail and auto firms such as Tesla and BMW have also seen enormous energy savings. Lovins’ most spectacular early success may have been his 1991 Hypercar concept, an all-electric, carbon-fibre-body vehicle that could do 300 miles to the gallon. It was dismissed at the time but all carmakers are now moving that way. The prize for governments wanting to be truly energy efficient is huge. Lovins and RMI have calculated that at least two-thirds – and probably as much as three-quarters – of all fossil fuel-generated energy could be profitably saved in most industrialised countries, and even more in developing countries because they tend to be less efficient to begin with and can more easily build things right than fix them later. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, he says, are leading the way for buildings, and Japan for industry. Lovins refers to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (Aceee), which says intelligent efficiency, smart buildings and smart manufacturing are all coming through. “For speed of improvement, though not absolute level since they started so low, China is the undisputed champion,” says Lovins. Lovins fears that design has been chopped into little bits and we are losing the bigger energy picture that the Victorians had. In a recent podcast with the UK energy adviser Micheal Liebreich, he explains how savings of 80% and more can be made in the least expected areas. As an example he shows that far less energy is needed to pump heat or cold through fat, straight pipes than skinny, long and crooked ones, because there is less friction. “In our house we save 97% of the pumping energy by properly laying out some pipes. Well, if everyone in the world did that to their pipes and ducts, you would save about a fifth of the world’s electricity, or half the coal-fired electricity. And you get your money back instantly in new-build or in under a year typically in retrofits in buildings and industry.” And yet, he says, this sort of energy efficiency is not taught, and it’s certainly not in any government study or climate model. Why not? “Because it’s not a technology. It’s a bloody design,” he says. The most energy-inefficient design of all, he says, may be nuclear power, which is heavily subsidised, costly and pushed by a politically powerful lobby. Using it to address shortages of electricity or to counter climate change, he argues, is like offering starving people rice and caviar when it’s far cheaper and easier to give just rice. “When you have a climate and energy emergency, like now, you need to invest judiciously, not indiscriminately, to buy the most efficient solution. Far better to deploy fast, inexpensive and sure technologies like wind or solar than one that is slow to build, speculative and very costly. Anything else makes climate change worse than it needs to be.” He demolishes the technology with statistics. “In 2020 the world added 0.4 gigawatts more nuclear capacity than it retired, whilst the world added 278 gigawatts of renewables – that’s a 782-fold greater capacity. Renewables swelled supply and displaced carbon as much every 38 hours as nuclear did all year. Where nuclear is cheap, renewables are cheaper still and efficiency is cheaper than that. There is no new type or size or fuel cycle of reactor that will change this. Do the maths. It is game over.” The future must be in the mass retrofitting of buildings with insulation and heat pumps and what he calls “outsolation”. “You can design out the pipes by putting a sort of tea cosy around houses, like the Dutch Energiesprong exterior retrofit. They can superinsulate your house to net zero standard in a single day whilst you’re at work, and meanwhile they’ve dropped in a very efficient heat pump core for mechanicals, and put on a super-insulated solar roof. And when you get back, you pay them rather than your energy companies.” Far better and more cost-effective in a historic emergency like this is for governments to invest in efficiency and to remove the many perverse subsidies and obstacles to people and businesses buying energy efficiency. It needs creative thinking, too. Why pay architects and engineers for what they spend, not what they save? Why reward energy companies for selling more energy, not cutting bills? Why not use the tax system to speed the uptake of renewables? Lovins, now the chair of RMI, teaches at Stanford while his colleagues help redesign the cement and forestry industries, as well as farming, retail and aviation sectors. He is hopeful that shorthaul and even medium-haul planes will soon be electrified and made energy-efficient by using new ultralight frames, structures, surfaces and fuel. Only half jokingly he urges a mass movement to knit millions of cheery yellow and blue woolly hats. That, and people turning down their thermostats by two or three degrees would save billions of cubic metres of gas. “Putin’s war is being financed by those who buy Russian fossil fuels. In the first two weeks the west has paid €8bn to Russia. We have a new energy crisis, and efficiency is the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest and fastest way to address it,” he says. At 7,200ft up in Snowmass, Lovins is eating crop No 79 of his bananas, and crop No 80 is shaping up. “Lots of other tropical fruits too,” he adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-19T15:04:35Z","webTitle":"Cameron’s decision to cut ‘green crap’ now costs each household in England £150 a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","fields":{"headline":"Cameron’s decision to cut ‘green crap’ now costs each household in England £150 a year","bodyText":"The decision by David Cameron’s government to ditch what he denounced as “green crap” policies will cost every household as much as £150 a year by the autumn, new analysis has shown. With energy prices already soaring and bills set to rise even further this year, it suggests Cameron’s decisions to effectively end onshore wind projects in England, cut solar subsidies and slash energy-efficiency schemes played a large part in rising bills. It comes with the government preparing to announce its much anticipated energy strategy this week, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further drives up energy prices. It is expected to push measures such as solar and onshore wind power generation, as well as North Sea oil projects. However, there are concerns that the Treasury is holding back more radical action. Many of this week’s measures could reverse action taken by the coalition government. Analysis by Carbon Brief looked at the cumulative effect of ending onshore wind subsidies, cutting energy efficiency funding and scrapping a programme to make all new homes carbon neutral. It also factored in cuts to solar energy subsidies. With the energy price cap already at £1,277 a year and rising to £1,971 in less than a fortnight and an expected £3,000 in October, the analysis found that maintaining the green policies would have reduced energy costs by £8.3bn a year for the economy overall, part of which would equate to £150 a year per household. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: “The government said they were ‘cutting the green crap’ but it was a disaster - with bills for working families much higher as a result. This demonstrates once again that going green is the right way to have energy security, cut bills, and tackle the climate crisis. “However often this government tries to relaunch their failed energy policy, they cannot be the solution to the crisis they created because they continue to face both ways on crucial issues like fracking and refuse to invest at scale at the solutions we need, including energy efficiency.” Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, who conducted the analysis, said: “Cutting the so-called ‘green crap’ has left UK households highly exposed to soaring global gas prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy efficiency and cheap renewables are the fastest and most effective ways to cut gas imports – and household bills.” Cameron won the Tory leadership by forging an eco-friendly reputation, pictured with huskies on an early trip to the Arctic in 2006 and later installing a wind turbine on his house but reports emerged that he had told aides to “get rid of the green crap” in 2013. At the time that the remarks emerged, Cameron’s team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not offer an outright denial. Then, a series of policies designed to push energy efficiency and renewable energy was scaled back. The number of homes having their lofts or cavity walls insulated each year dropped by 92% and 74% in 2013 respectively and has never recovered. Subsidies ended for onshore wind turbines, and planning reforms made them harder to build. Meanwhile, solar power was excluded from government support in 2015. Ministers have been battling for weeks to find ways of taking the pressure off energy and fuel costs. Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia this week to call for cheaper oil prices, while ministers have made clear that onshore wind and solar power generation will be prioritised in their plans. However, chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected more radical plans such as cutting VAT on fuel bills or delaying a planned national insurance increase to help with household costs. Government officials said that a package worth billions had already been designed, including a £150 council tax rebate for many households in England from April and a £200 energy bill loan in Great Britain in October. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “We have consistently backed renewable energy sources including both onshore and offshore wind, delivering a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid since 2010. “We are also accelerating our progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England’s homes, investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings and bringing in higher minimum performance standards to ensure all homes meet EPC Band C by 2035. We are also insulating millions of consumers from high gas prices through the energy price cap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2022/mar/12/alex-honnold-climbing-the-soloist","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Alex Honnold: ‘My new film is almost too much for some people’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/alex-honnold-climbing-the-soloist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/mar/12/alex-honnold-climbing-the-soloist","fields":{"headline":"Alex Honnold: ‘My new film is almost too much for some people’","bodyText":"The great promise of virtual reality lies in its potential to replicate otherwise unattainable experiences. And few in the physical world can match the experiences of Alex Honnold, the American rock climber who has distinguished himself with ropeless ascents up some of the world’s most fearsome cliffs. No one had ever completed a “free-solo” climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park before Honnold famously did so in 2017, a feat that was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary. Now comes another film about Honnold, one that takes viewers as close they will probably ever get to the hair-raising exploits that have made him a rock star. The new virtual reality series, Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR, invites you to tag along as he embarks on free-solo climbs in the Italian and French Alps. Strap on a headset, and you’re immersed in a panorama of sky, snow and rock. Crane your head upward to watch as Honnold navigates his way to the summit. Peer over your shoulder, and you’re met with a sweeping view of wilderness. Look down, and – well, maybe don’t look down. The two-part series, which was released last week, offers up plenty of mind-blowing scenery. But it could be difficult viewing for some, and not just because it’s only available on Meta’s line of Quest VR headsets. “I think for some people it might be one of the most intense things they’ve ever watched,” Honnold tells the Guardian. “Even when I’m watching I’m like, ‘This is a lot.’ I did the actual climbs and it still feels pretty intense.” Honnold said even his family of climbers has only been able to consume the two half-hour episodes in “small doses.” “They’re really struggling to watch the whole film because it really puts them there,” he says. “I don’t know, it’s almost too much for them.” The Soloist was directed by Jonathan Griffith, a filmmaker who specializes in shooting mountain sports. An alpinist himself, Griffith says virtual reality is the “most powerful way to bring people into my world of climbing.” “I really fell in love with VR because the whole thing that motivates me in my work is to bring people into my world of the high mountains – the Himalayas, the Alps or wherever,” Griffith says. “You’re putting humans in these alien looking worlds, and it’s completely crazy. I love taking photos of that and sharing them with the world.” Griffith wisely eschewed music in the production, allowing viewers to take in all the raw, ambient sounds of Honnold’s climbs. At the end of the first episode, with Honnold on a free solo climb in the Dolomites, he pauses to tie his shoe. And suddenly, it’s just you and him on the precipice, both sharing a sublime view of the Italian Alps amid the unmatched stillness of nature. If you can avoid any bouts of vertigo – and you have access to the necessary hardware – the series is worth checking out for moments like that. “The thing that I love about soloing is being in these incredible places and having these powerful experiences,” Honnold says. “In the VR film, the scenes are long enough so the viewer can look around a little bit and get a taste of what I love about those places.” Honnold, 36, is still feeling the aftereffects of his triumph at El Capitan. The historic, ropeless climb of Yosemite’s famous monolith of granite was chronicled in Free Solo, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2019 and brought Honnold even more fame. In January, he joined a long line of celebrities to make cameos on the Showtime series Billions. Honnold says he gets recognized in public more since the release of the documentary, which has also generated more commercial opportunities and increased exposure to his solar energy foundation. “Basically everything has been turned up quite a bit,” he says. “But at the heart of it, [the fame] hasn’t really changed the things that matter the most. I’m still climbing five days a week. I’m still spending my time on projects that are exciting to me.” Free Solo served as a window into what makes Honnold tick, and what it’s like to be in his orbit. Audiences saw his singularity of focus in his push to conquer El Cap, as well as the anxiety the pursuit brought to his friends. Throughout the film, Honnold wrestles with his personal life, openly wondering if a budding romance will compromise his climbing goals. In one scene, he and his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, discuss whether a family might cause him to recalibrate his capacity for risk. Since then, Honnold and McCandless have gotten married. Last month, they welcomed the birth of their first child. “I was always expecting to go through the full range of adulthood at some point,” Honnold says. “I always wanted to have a family eventually. I always wanted a stable relationship. It’s all according to plan.” Speaking by phone as he holds his newborn daughter, June, Honnold says that his expanded family hasn’t caused him to rein in his ambitions, noting that he completed the free-solo climbs for the VR series during his wife’s pregnancy. He didn’t climb for a week following the birth, as June remained in the hospital to receive treatment for now-resolved medical complications. “Now that I’m coming out of that, I’ve actually been feeling heroically strong,” Honnold says. “I wonder if that’s just a byproduct of fatherhood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/05/light-or-blight-anger-rises-at-plan-for-britains-biggest-solar-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Light … or blight?

Anger rises at plan for Britain’s biggest solar farm","bodyText":"A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – faces opposition over claims it would be a “blight” on the countryside. The scheme, which would provide power for up to 100,000 homes, will cover nearly 2,800 acres near Newmarket, more than 10 times bigger than any scheme built to date in Britain. It is one of more than 900 solar farms in the planning pipeline to help provide green energy. Campaigners say the Sunnica energy farm, which will span several villages in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, will change the unique character of a vast area of countryside shaped by farming and horseracing. Suffolk county council said last week it would not support the scheme in its current form. Richard Rout, deputy council leader and cabinet member for finance and environment, said: “We recognise that renewable energy is a key part of delivering energy security but it can’t come at any cost or to the detriment of Suffolk or the environment.” John James, 74, who owns Brookside Stud, near Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, said: “The solar panels will blight several villages and take farmland out of production.” He was particularly concerned over the fire safety of the vast batteries that would be housed near his stud in containers up to six metres high. Finlay Colville, head of research at Solar Media, a business intelligence and digital media firm, said there are now about 910 possible solar farm projects in the pipeline in the UK, with numbers increasing by about a third in 2021. More than 300 have already submitted planning applications or have already been approved. Colville said some of the largest projects might not be delivered but there were also many smaller sites that were being approved. “Solar farms can be built quickly, and it’s a quick win for firms and public bodies which want to have more renewable energy,” he said. While many councils support renewable energy schemes, there are concerns about some large-scale projects, including the Cottam solar project on the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire border, covering 2,800 acres; the Mallard Pass solar farm in Lincolnshire and Rutland, covering 2,175 acres; and the Gate Burton energy park, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, covering 1,690 acres. Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, has raised concern about such large-scale schemes. He told parliament last month: “Is it not time we looked at how we can stop these companies bypassing local planning and secure proper community gain and the protection of agriculture, and ensure that there are buffer zones around villages?” Ministers say, where possible, large schemes should use previously developed land to help preserve farmland. Many smaller schemes arise from the demand for green energy in the public sector. Work started in November on a 30-acre scheme to help power the New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton, while the Ministry of Justice has proposed a two-acre installation next to Whatton prison, near Bingham in Nottinghamshire. Sunnica said its scheme would make a “significant contribution” to help the UK meet its net-zero targets by 2050. It said it would respond to any concerns raised over its scheme in the planning process, that it took the safety of its battery storage system very seriously and thta it had a package of proposed safety measures to mitigate the risk of a fire. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to preserve greenfield land while protecting the environment as we work to generate more cheap, clean power in the UK. Solar energy developments, including these ones, are subject to strict planning controls to protect local communities and the environment. This includes the requirement to conduct environmental impact assessments and public consultations on planning applications.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-28T07:30:35Z","webTitle":"Solar panels: a ray of hope as UK energy prices go through the roof","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels: a ray of hope as UK energy prices go through the roof","bodyText":"With energy bills on their way up again from April, homeowners are looking skywards to try and ease the pressure on their budgets – by installing solar panels. The latest change to the regulator’s cap on default tariffs means, from spring, that the average annual dual-fuel bill will go up to £1,971, an increase of 54% on current levels. And with homeowners increasingly working from home, and therefore using more energy during the day, many are looking at installing panels to cut costs, and even earn from the energy they generate. Thomas Newby, chief executive of Leeds-based renewable energy company egg, says they received the same number of inquiries in the first nine days of this month as they did in the whole of November. “Many consumers are still on fixed deals but which will likely come to an end shortly, so I expect we may see a further increase in demand in the coming year,” he says. What it costs Solar panels convert energy from the sun into electricity. Stronger sunlight creates more electricity, which can then either be used in your home or exported to the national grid. But installing them comes at a cost. The average bill reaches almost £5,000 and rising labour bills and shortages of photovoltaic panels mean prices are going up. Domestic systems are generally made up of between 10 and 15 panels, each of which generate between 200W and 350W of energy, according to the Energy Saving Trust, a charity promoting energy efficiency. The more panels on the roof, the higher the installation cost but also the potential for more energy. The average price for an installation of a 3.5kW system is £4,800, including labour. This tends to be about 12 panels. “This is the average size for domestic systems in the UK,” says Brian Horne, senior insight and analytics consultant at the Energy Saving Trust. “The amount you pay for installation will be influenced by the size of the system, and will also be affected by any difficulty with access to your roof.” This price does not include the cost of a battery, which allows solar energy to be stored for use at a later time. They range between £1,200 and £6,000, according to GreenMatch, which compares green energy products. Although prices for solar systems have come down over the last decade, the increased cost of labour as well as the shortage in panels from China recently, has sent costs on the way back up, says Newby. “That’s as a result of some increase in material prices but, more generally, it is labour. That’s a big part of the job.” Planning and permissions The ideal roof for solar panels is south-facing. East- or west- facing roofs yield up to 20% less energy; north-facing ones are the least productive and deemed to be impractical in the UK. For a 3.5kW system you need room for 15 to 20 sq metres of panels. The best results will be achieved from a roof angled at 30 degrees. Most UK roofs are between 30 and 45 degrees, according to consumer group Which?. Solar panels are classed as permitted developments so in most cases will not require planning permission. However, if you live in a listed building or a conservation area, there may be restrictions. It is best to contact your local council to be absolutely clear. When solar panels are to be installed, the company which brings electricity to your home – the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) – must be informed. The Energy Networks Association has an online tool which, by entering your postcode, will tell you which company operates in your area. If a solar system is above a certain size, prior permission is needed from the DNO and can take up to three months to obtain, according to Newby. After the preparation for putting the system in place is complete, installing the panels can take one to two days. Making money back Under the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), households can get paid for electricity that they do not use which is exported back to the grid. You can shop around to get the best price for the energy you are creating. The trade association Solar Energy UK lists the best rates for homes feeding back into the grid. Tesla’s Energy Plan tops its table, paying 12p per kWh, although it requires you to have one of its own Powerwall batteries installed. Octopus energy pays 7.5p per kWh. The savings on your bills, and how long it will take to recoup the money invested, vary depending on where a home is, whether electricity is sold back to the grid and how much energy you use. In London, a property where residents are at home all day and selling energy back to the grid can make savings of £385 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. The same home where residents are out until after 6pm and don’t feed electricity into the grid would save £120. In Stirling, Scotland, a home occupied for the day and feeding back saves £340 while the same house empty and not feeding in saves £110. The Energy Saving Trust says there has been little research on how solar panels affect the value of a property, but says those with better energy performance sell for more. “It seems likely their impact on house prices will increase following recent energy price rises and the associated focus on ways to reduce energy requirements and switch to renewable energy,” says Horne. A report from Solar Energy UK found homes with solar panels can increase in value by £1,800, following an analysis of property sales. The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) certifies products and installations used to produce electricity and heat from renewable sources, and should be used as a first stop to find accredited installers near you, says Horne. As costs vary, it is best to get three quotes before committing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T09:07:15Z","webTitle":"Can Germany function without Vladimir Putin’s gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","fields":{"headline":"Can Germany function without Vladimir Putin’s gas?","bodyText":"The Ukraine crisis has plunged Germany into an intense debate about how it will heat its homes and power its industry in future, summed up in the short question: can Europe’s largest economy function without Vladimir Putin’s gas? The Green federal economics minister, Robert Habeck, answered with a decisive “yes it can”, a day after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was meant to deliver from Russia as much as 70% of Germany’s gas requirements. There are considerable doubts as to whether the $11bn project will ever now go ahead. But even before Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday morning, NS2 was just a small part of the wider discussion some say Germany has been far too slow to have. At stake is nothing less than the future of German – and by extension European – energy security. Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants, leaving observers wondering how the country was planning to make its energy policy workable and future-proof. Sceptics have questioned how it made sense for Germany to make itself so dependent on Russian gas when it should be distancing itself from Putin’s autocratic machinery. Until recently, the answer from the top of government was that this was an economic project, not a political one. The robotically repeated mantra now sounds at the best naive, and at the worst, given the current turn of events, a self-defeating decision which has helped fund Putin’s war. Habeck admitted “we face turbulent days ahead”, as he promised on Wednesday that the government would provide relief where necessary to compensate for the expected rise in gas prices. One of the government’s main predicaments is whether it can deliver on its promise to make a switch to renewable energy sources in order to reach its climate goal to become carbon neutral by 2045. Gas is seen as the vital bridge in that endeavour, which, while seen as ambitious by international standards, is viewed by many climate experts as barely adequate. Importing liquified natural gas (LNG) has been viewed as one option as part of a diversification strategy. However, this has been beset by numerous problems – not least the lack of a terminal in Germany necessary to handle LNG imports. Neither would available LNG supplies be able to fully replace Russian gas and it is also an expensive alternative. Gas already comes from Norway, but those supplies cannot be increased as it is already producing to capacity. Leonhard Birnbaum, the CEO of Germany’s biggest gas and electricity provider E.ON, said that while energy supplies for this winter were secure, next year could be more of a challenge. “If Russian gas imports were to break down completely, the immediate effect wouldn’t be so dramatic as we’re almost at the end of the heating season. But next winter it could be the case that we’re not able to meet the supply demands of all the industrial customers. Some of them may have to turn off the power. It is utopian to believe that Russian gas can be completely replaced from one day to the next by other sources,” he told Die Zeit. Other critics have said Germany only has itself to blame, having dillydallied on its much vaunted plans to switch from fossil fuels to renewables. A positive headline to emerge from the recent heavy storms which hit much of northern Europe, was the record amount of energy fed into the grid by its wind turbines on Sunday. But it also served to underline how slow the development of renewables has been. Beyond Germany’s borders the short-term answer is thought to be simple: why not reverse the decisions, or at least prolong the use of coal-fired power plants and temporarily restart the nuclear reactors? But these options are seen as politically suicidal in Berlin – in particular the reactivation of nuclear plants (as well as being highly impractical and disastrous from a legal point of view). Opposition to nuclear was the founding principal of the Green party – two of whose former leaders, Habeck and the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, are now in government. Both have always opposed the pipeline. There is no evidence of ordinary Germans panicking, although heating installation companies say there has been a considerable increase in inquiries about heat pumps from people keen to find an alternative to the gas central heating. “In the short term it won’t be easy to move away from natural gas,” Hans-Martin Henning, the head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, told Tagesspiegel. “But in the medium term this must be part of the concept of speeding up the energy source switch in the heat sector and wherever possible electrical heat pumps should be used as a way of becoming more independent from natural gas.” Andreas Löschel, an energy economist, told the same newspaper that even before the Ukraine crisis, Russia had destroyed its own narrative about being a reliable provider of cheap gas. “The trust is no longer there,” he said. “Russia has shot itself in the foot”. Just days ago at a press briefing with Scholz in Moscow, Putin heaped praise on Scholz’s fellow Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor turned lobbyist for Gazprom, saying he was responsible for brokering generous fuel rates. It was one of Schröder’s final acts in office in 2005 to sign the NS2 deal before he was appointed chairman of the company behind it. On Thursday calls were growing for the government to remove Schröder’s privileges as a former chancellor, including an office and staff, amid reports they cost the taxpayer more than €400,000 (£344,244) a year, on top of his considerable earnings from lobbying for companies including Rosneft and Gazprom. An online petition said a “former chancellor who is financed by autocrats, and makes himself dependent on them, in so doing ridiculing German interests, should no longer be financed by the German taxpayer”. Some politicians called for him to be added to the list of individuals facing sanctions. Writing on the LinkedIn platform, Schröder said although “many mistakes” had “been made on both sides” in the relationship between the west and Russia, Russia’s “security interests did not justify its intervention by military means”. He called on the Russian government to “end the suffering of the people in Ukraine as soon as possible”. He also warned against “cutting the remaining political, economic and societal connections” between Europe and Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T10:00:19Z","webTitle":"Supreme court case could restrict Biden’s effort to tackle climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court case could restrict Biden’s effort to tackle climate crisis","bodyText":"Joe Biden’s faltering effort to tackle the climate crisis faces a further, potentially devastating, blow on Monday in a supreme court case that experts warn could severely restrict any future US government attempt to limit planet-heating emissions. The court has agreed to hear a case brought by West Virginia, supported by 18 other Republican-led states, that takes aim at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ability to issue strict regulations to curb pollution from fossil fuel-fired power stations. The decision by the conservative-leaning court to even consider an argument about a hypothetical regulation that hasn’t been proposed by the EPA has surprised onlookers. It is also an ominous sign for the authority of a Biden administration already frustrated over major clean energy legislation that has stalled in Congress due to opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats such as West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. “This is a vitally important case that will define future federal action on climate change issues,” said Judith Enck, former EPA regional administrator and president of Beyond Plastics. “Congress seems unwilling or unable to address the climate crisis. Federal agencies need to be able to take action.” Even if Biden and his allies in Congress are able to pass the climate elements of the Build Back Better Act, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars in support for wind and solar energy and electric cars, most analysts say executive action to slash pollution from power plants, cars and trucks will still be needed if the US is to meet its emissions reduction goals and avert disastrous climate change. West Virginia’a lawsuit, filed last year and supported by various fossil fuel firms and rightwing groups, argues that the EPA shouldn’t be able to issue rules that “are capable of reshaping the nation’s electricity grids and unilaterally decarbonizing virtually any sector of the economy” and claims that Congress alone should decide on regulation of this scope. “This case is much more than about climate change, it gets down to who makes the decisions, should it be an unelected body of bureaucrats or should Congress provide the clear signal,” said Patrick Morrissey, attorney general of West Virginia, a state that’s a traditional epicenter of the now ailing coal industry. The Biden administration has pointed out there is no current EPA climate regulation on coal plants, meaning that there is no case to argue at all. “Petitioners lack standing to invoke this court’s jurisdiction because they are not injured,” the administration has argued in its brief. It’s unusual for the supreme court to hear a case where there is no active rule to challenge, according to Richard Revesz, a leading expert in environmental law at the New York University School of Law. “It surprised me they took this case, this would be an excellent candidate for dismissal,” he said. “In normal times, when the court wasn’t so skeptical of regulation, this case would’ve been dismissed. It would have a pernicious consequences if it were allowed because it could severely restrict agencies’ ability to regulate and these power stations are such big emitters.” The case has a tangled history that highlights America’s jarring absence of any climate regulations on the US electricity sector, which is responsible for a quarter of the country’s emissions, even as it has set emissions standards for the pollution spewed out by cars and trucks. In 2015, Barack Obama’s administration sought to remedy this via the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to restrict emissions from coal-fired power plants, only to be immediately challenged by Republican-led states and, in a highly unusual move, blocked by the supreme court before it took effect. Donald Trump’s administration then crafted a far weaker replacement for this rule that was itself struck down by the courts, with Biden so far declining to resurrect the original Clean Power Plan, or any more stringent alternative, in its place. West Virginia and its allies hope to curtail any future attempt by the EPA to become far more assertive in its interpretation of the landmark Clean Air Act, which requires power plants to use the “best system of emission reduction.” Environmental groups, which have lined up to oppose West Virginia’s claims, worry that the case is a further example of a rightwing judicial system intervening to toss out rules it does not like with the justification that they are too large, with damaging consequences for the climate crisis. Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from accounting for the real-world costs of climate change. “Even though there is no rule in place, the case is important because coal companies and their allies are attempting to get the supreme court to establish a broad precedent that meaningful protections for public health and the environment should be scrutinized and discredited on judicial review,” said Sean Donahue, counsel for Environmental Defense Fund. “Petitioners’ damaging legal theory would threaten our nation’s ability to protect clean air, clean water, and safe food for all people.” To some onlookers, the case is an unwanted further complication to a challenge that already has little time to waste. “There is no more time to delay curbing greenhouse gas emissions and finding solutions for a more equitable and just clean energy future,” said Carol Browner, former administrator of the EPA and now chair of the League of Conservation Voters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine | Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine","bodyText":"The Syria crisis continues unnoticed. It holds key lessons for the west about Putin yet it has gone virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world. War crimes and crimes against humanity continue in the Russian-sponsored dictatorship, even as some misguided leaders want to usher Bashar al-Assad, the architect of these crimes, back into acceptable society. We can rest assured that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, unlike Assad, is not welcoming Putin with open arms. But in responding to the Ukraine emergency, there are lessons the west can and should learn from the situation in Syria. Since the UN removed Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile in 2014, Assad has continued to bomb hospitals and schools, and burn villages to the ground in a macabre, medieval-style scorched-earth policy. Mercifully, we have not seen chemical weapons used since April 2019, but Syria today is a Russian state in all but name, and Assad a puppet dictator with strings very clearly tugged from Moscow. Idlib, a province in northwest Syria, is the only region still free of the tyranny, but with millions of malnourished souls trapped there, and Assad throwing in incendiary devices to smoke them out as you would vermin, it still resembles hell on earth. Even the UN has turned its back on Idlib, giving aid to Assad and his wife to distribute as they see fit. Syria now represents a major Russian and Iranian presence on the edge of Europe; and if Ukraine also falls, the balance of power will very much shift eastwards. With too many European countries reliant on Russian gas, the current global instability began in Damascus. An emboldened Russia buoyed up by high oil prices seems much more willing to face off with Nato than it did a few years ago, when its antiquated military was no match for western tanks. While the rest of us have cut our militaries to the bone, relying on electronics and space to fight the next war, Russia has modernised its armoured might, now on show around Ukraine – there is a unique quality in mass and heavy armour, which no cyberwarrior is going to vaporise. Syria shows what happens when you turn a blind eye and are too heavily influenced by peaceniks. Those of us involved in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 30 years have our issues with overstepping the mark in those places, but we look at Syria and know we should have done better. That knowledge should inform our response to Putin’s aggression now. It is clear when discussing Syria with Syrians from Idlib and regime-held areas that everybody has suffered. At least those in Idlib are getting support through Turkey, and there are some innovative projects being funded by European countries. Many hospitals and clinics in Idlib now have solar power to run their generators and surgical theatres, as there is no fuel and the power network was destroyed years ago. There is an electric car, also powered by solar energy, distributing medicines and Covid vaccines – when they are occasionally available – around Idlib. In a remarkable twist that would only happen in war, some of these Syrian medics who have developed a viable medical system under the most trying and demanding circumstances are now offering to help in Afghanistan. The Syrian people have shown resilience and innovation beyond compare, even as they have been let down again and again. First, the west did not intervene when the regime started attacking its own people. Then, in response to chemical weapon use, illegal under every rule of war, the US declared a red line on their use – but failed to act when that line was crossed. And finally, we stood by as Russia and Iran muscled their way across Syria to create a forward operation base on our doorstep. Our leaders will do well to remember this and be strong and resilient to protect Ukraine. I cannot think that a few sanctions on a few banks and billionaires is going to perturb Putin. He only understands strength and power – it’s time to show our steel.

Scientists have estimated that the black carbon produced by vessels, planes and diesel generators results in 23mm of additional snowmelt each summer in the most frequently visited areas of the ice-covered landmass. More than 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2019–2020 season, nearly double the figures from a decade ago. A team of researchers sampled the snow yearly between 2016 and 2020 at 28 sites spanning 2000km from Antarctica’s northern tip to the Ellsworth Mountains. They focused primarily on the Antarctic peninsula, where about half of the research facilities on the continent are located and where an estimated 95% of Antarctic tourist trips are made. The team estimated that 53,000 tourists visited Antarctica annually between 2016 and 2020. Study co-author Dr Raúl Cordero, of the University of Santiago Chile, said Antarctic snow was the cleanest on Earth, typically with baseline levels of black carbon around one part in a billion. “That is 1000 times less than what you would find in the Himalayas, and 100 times less than what you can find in the Andes or in the Rocky Mountains,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Black carbon levels at sites on the Antarctic peninsula were between two and four times higher than on other parts of the continent. “What black carbon is doing is making the snow darker [so it] is absorbing more solar radiation,” Cordero said. “That extra energy is accelerating the melting of the snow.” He believes a limit on the number of tourists to Antarctica may need to be adopted. The team quantified the likely snowmelt by calculating how black carbon pollution reduced the snow’s albedo – a measure of how well a surface reflects solar energy. They calculated that an Antarctic researcher’s black carbon footprint was about 10 times greater than a tourist’s. “We estimated that … the snow that is melting faster because of the activities carried out by a researcher would be closer to 1000 tonnes,” Cordero said. “Every researcher is using vessels, planes, helicopters, generators – and everybody’s using diesel for powering these.” Cordero said that while the amount of pollution-induced snowmelt is far less than the ice and snow lost to global warming, the study highlighted the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. “There are technical alternatives to diesel that could be used in Antarctica,” he said, citing the Belgian research station, Princess Elisabeth Antarctica, which is primarily powered by wind. Prof Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of earth atmosphere and environment at Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said the link between black carbon pollution and increased surface melt was well established in other parts of the world. “In the Antarctic peninsula the two major processes [affecting melting] would still be warming oceans melting ice shelves from beneath, or warming surface air temperatures that are melting the ice from above,” Mackintosh said. “If we have even greater surface warming in [the] decades to centuries ahead, as is projected for the Antarctic peninsula, then the additional black carbon on the surface will cause even more melt than would have occurred otherwise,” he said. “Human activity is causing the polar regions to warm, but the burning of … [fossil] fuels has a direct consequence in terms of surface melt as well.” “If you can get rid of the greenhouse gases in the first place, you’ll reduce the temperature increase,” he said. “There’s also the added benefit of less darkening of the snow surfaces.” Cordero said: “Antarctica is the last continent more or less unpolluted. I think we should try to keep it that way.” The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/feb/22/kenya-to-use-solar-panels-to-boost-crops-by-harvesting-the-sun-twice","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-22T09:51:26Z","webTitle":"Kenya to use solar panels to boost crops by ‘harvesting the sun twice’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/kenya-to-use-solar-panels-to-boost-crops-by-harvesting-the-sun-twice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/kenya-to-use-solar-panels-to-boost-crops-by-harvesting-the-sun-twice","fields":{"headline":"Kenya to use solar panels to boost crops by ‘harvesting the sun twice’","bodyText":"Solar panels are not a new way of providing cheap power across much of the African continent, where there is rarely a shortage of sunshine. But growing crops underneath the panels is, and the process has had such promising trials in Kenya that it will be deployed this week in open-field farms. Known as agrivoltaics, the technique harvests solar energy twice: where panels have traditionally been used to harness the sun’s rays to generate energy, they are also utilised to provide shade for growing crops, helping to retain moisture in the soil and boosting growth. An initial year-long research collaboration between the University of Sheffield, World Agroforestry and the Kajiado-based Latia Agripreneurship Institute has shown promising results in the semi-arid Kajiado county, a 90-minute drive from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi and this week the full project will be officially launched. For example, cabbages grown under the 180, 345-watt solar panels have been a third bigger, and healthier, than those grown in control plots with the same amount of fertiliser and water. Other crops such as aubergine and lettuce have shown similar results. Maize grown under the panels was taller and healthier, according to Judy Wairimu, an agronomist at the institute. “We wanted to see how crops would perform if grown under these panels,” said Wairimu. But there is another pragmatic reason behind the technology: doubling up the output of the same patch of earth to generate power and cultivate food can go a long way towards helping people with limited land resources, she said. According to Dr Richard Randle-Boggis, a researcher at the University of Sheffield’s Harvesting the Sun Twice project, the trial initiative will determine the potential of agrivoltaic systems in east Africa. “We needed to build a test system to see if this technology will be suitable for the region,” Randle-Boggis said, reiterating that, unlike conventional solar mini-grid systems, agrivoltaics have the additional benefits of improving food and water security, while strengthening people’s resilience against the climate crisis, as well as providing low-carbon electricity. The solar panels do not just reduce water loss from plants and the soil – their shade mitigates some of the stress experienced by plants due to high day temperatures and UV damage, Randle-Boggis said. Agrivoltaics can have a notable impact on household income in remote locations such as Kajiado. “Women here can spend up to 300 Kenyan shillings (£2) on a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) fare to the market just to buy vegetables worth 100 Kenyan shillings,” said Anne Macharia, head of training at Latia Agripreneurship Institute. The solar panels can be placed three metres from the ground, providing ample room for a farmer to work below, or higher in bigger systems to allow access for agricultural machinary. Randle-Boggis acknowledged the technology has limitations, but says that in “areas of Kenya which are not currently suitable for horticulture, it may be possible to grow other crops under the improved environmental conditions under the panels”. In other countries including France, the US and Germany, the technology has been employed successfully."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-21T16:30:21Z","webTitle":"Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","fields":{"headline":"Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?","bodyText":"What exactly is being proposed? It is, by any measure, an extraordinary intervention in Australia’s rapidly evolving electricity market. A consortium worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Saturday lodged a formal offer to buy AGL Energy – the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – for just short of 5% above the closing share price on Friday. The headline name behind the bid is Mike Cannon-Brookes, the 42-year-old co-founder of software company Atlassian, green solutions investor, climate action advocate and one of Australia’s richest people. But in reality, Cannon-Brookes’ company Grok Ventures is the smaller player in the consortium, which is led by Brookfield, a Canadian investment giant with $688bn worth of assets under management last year. Including AGL’s debt, the bid was just short of A$8bn. Why are they doing it? According to the main players, a significant part of the motivation is to close and replace the company’s coal-fired power plants and prevent a controversial demerger that would hive off those coal plants from AGL into a new entity called Accel Energy. The consortium says it has up to $20bn to spend on building and contracting at least 8 gigawatts of renewable energy and energy storage to replace about 7GW of existing power plants. AGL’s Bayswater and Loy Yang A coal plants, currently scheduled to shut by 2033 and 2045, would be gone by 2030. The company would reach net zero emissions by 2035 and suddenly be playing its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C, in line with scientific advice. The proposal is much bigger than just the coal power plants. It would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring all of AGL’s generation assets and its retail business. Cannon-Brookes stresses it isn’t a philanthropic investment. He says he is confident backing renewable energy over ailing old coal power plants can keep electricity prices down, create 10,000 construction and 600 ongoing jobs and wipe out about 40m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions footprint – while turning a profit. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. For Brookfield’s part, it is a shareholder in significant fossil fuel assets, but it is noteworthy that the bid includes the name of Mark Carney, the company’s head of transition investing since 2020. He made his name as first the governor of the Bank of Canada, then the Bank of England, and then the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance in the lead-up to last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. A Brookfield renewable energy arm has about US$65bn assets under management. The bid is timed with at least one eye on the upcoming demerger, which AGL declared on Monday was on track to happen by 30 June. The consortium says the split risked leading to the separated entities trading at a lower share price, reducing value for shareholders. How did the company respond? There was a swift rejection after the board met on Sunday afternoon. It claimed the offer “materially undervalues the company”, as it offered only a 4.7% premium on Friday’s share price. The consortium rejected this rebuttal just as quickly. It says the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average share price of $6.28 and pointed to its expectation the value would fall after the split. Cannon-Brookes told Guardian Australia on Monday the consortium would continue to engage with AGL and he would focus on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option”. Within AGL, there was some excitement at the prospect that a billionaire entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm was making a play for the company. It had lost up to 80% of its share value over the five years prior to the takeover offer although its stock had started to bounce back in the past 12 months. AGL shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. Putting aside the business machinations, is this even doable? According to the experts, yes, though it would be challenging. Cannon-Brookes was quick to point to a draft blueprint for the future grid published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in December, known as the integrated system plan. That document suggested under a step-change scenario – now considered the most probable path – coal would exit the system at roughly three times the pace than proposed and there could be a ninefold increase in large-scale renewable energy such as wind and solar farms. It is not a report the Morrison government tends to emphasise. No one disputes that the rise of renewable energy is making coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. Department officials project renewable energy will increase from about 30% now to 69% by 2030. Labor says under its policies it would reach 82%. It is not only AGL that is under pressure. In the most recent announcement, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. The consortium says they can drive a rapid change at AGL in a way the current public ownership can’t because raising the vast amount of capital needed is difficult, but they already have it. Are there unanswered questions? Plenty, including whether the consortium would be open to paying more and the timing and specifics of the investment plan. The bid would have to be cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission – and possibly the Morrison government, should it choose to intervene. Buying AGL would involve taking on 3.2 million gas customers. Cannon-Brookes indicated the consortium would want to move them to renewable electricity, a significant undertaking in its own right. Cannon-Brookes acknowledges it is “on a global scale a massive decarbonisation effort” but says the plan makes sense. The consortium’s offer letter says it conducted detailed market modelling with consultants Marsden Jacob Associates and was confident its plan was achievable. “The economics stacks up, the science stacks up, what we require is just the gumption to go for it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-21T07:02:12Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes dismisses PM’s suggestion that coal plants should run to end of scheduled life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes dismisses PM’s suggestion that coal plants should run to end of scheduled life","bodyText":"Mike Cannon-Brookes has rejected a suggestion by Scott Morrison that a plan to shut AGL Energy’s coal power plants early would push up electricity bills, with the tech billionaire arguing fossil fuel generators are increasingly unreliable and new solar and wind lowers prices for consumers. Morrison on Monday responded to a proposed joint takeover of AGL by Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield. The prime minister said the government wanted coal plants to run until the end of their scheduled operating life and he was “very committed to sweating those assets” to ensure a reliable electricity supply at affordable prices. Two Liberal moderates, however, have warmly welcomed the bid for AGL, with backbencher Jason Falinksi stating “this is a real positive”. AGL rejected the initial bid by Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures to buy the company for about $8bn, shut its coal plants by 2030, and build or contract for about eight gigawatts of new renewable energy and storage to replace it. But the consortium immediately pledged to continue to work on a takeover plan in shareholders’ interests. Asked about Morrison’s comments, Cannon-Brookes said the existing listed closure dates for Australia’s coal plants were not realistic, did not reflect “the economic life of those assets” and the consortium would spend up to $20bn on top of the sale price to replace AGL’s coal fleet “at a much lower price and a much higher reliability”. “Let’s face it – those coal plants aren’t exactly winning awards for reliability,” Cannon-Brookes, the co-creator of the software company Atlassian and one of Australia’s richest people, told Guardian Australia. “We’re trying to do this to provide lower power prices to the customers of AGL that increasingly want clean power as well because they have their own decarbonisation goals.” Cannon-Brookes said Australians were enjoying the lowest power prices in eight years, as the government had consistently pointed out, due to a significant increase of renewable energy into the power grid. He said his consortium was doing what the Morrison government had demanded when it called on the private market to replace coal plants before they closed so the commonwealth did not have to intervene further in the electricity market. “The private market is stepping up and providing that replacement capacity exactly as asked, and on an earlier schedule, which will result in lower power prices for all of those customers,” he said. “I assume he [Morrison] will be very happy with that.” Morrison’s dismissal of the proposal was backed more forcefully by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who said “affordable, deliverable, 24/7, no-questions-asked power” was essential to making Australia “strong”. Joyce contended on Monday that wind and solar energy did not meet those criteria. Joyce said if there was a problem down the line associated with replacing coal-fired power generation with renewable generation, Cannon-Brookes would not have to deal with it. “Poor people will pay for that problem,” he said. Cannon-Brooks said the takeover plan could create 10,000 construction jobs and would eliminate all emissions from Australia’s biggest corporate polluter by 2035. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of the national carbon footprint. Asked what role he would play if the bid was successful, Cannon-Brookes said he was currently focused on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option” and to show to everyone involved there were “alternate paths to this transformation”. He said he “deeply believed” decarbonisation was Australia’s greatest economic opportunity. “I’m happy to help in any which way. Obviously, my wife [Annie] and I and my family office have put a significant amount of capital into this, and this is not a philanthropic exercise. We believe that the economics stack up here and we can use our capital, which we’re very fortunate to have, in a catalytic way to help trigger and create that change,” he said. Two Liberal moderates warmly welcomed the bid for AGL. Falinksi said on Monday: “I think this is the market working.” “The bid has been rejected so [the consortium] will have to revise their numbers. But what Mike Cannon-Brookes is saying makes sense. He can deliver electricity for lower prices using renewables than using legacy coal assets,” the Mackellar MP said. “As long as he can make the numbers stack up around dispatchable power and reliability, which – with the cost of battery power declining and with pumped hydro coming online – then he can probably do that. This makes sense and he’s probably getting the assets on the cheap, so well done.” Fellow New South Wales moderate Andrew Bragg said the bid suggested investors now had the right policy signals to drive the energy transition. “The energy transition is going to be very expensive and it will be heavily reliant on foreign capital, which is why sending the right signals to foreign capital is important,” the senator said. “I think [the proposal] is good. It is good to see foreign and domestic capital seeking to propel the transition”. AGL recently brought forward the nominated closure date for two of its coal plants, Bayswater in NSW and Loy Yang A in Victoria, to no later than 2033 and 2045 respectively. The closure of its Liddell coal generator, also in NSW, had already been accelerated to next year. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. AGL said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. The consortium partners argued it was as it would avoid a “potentially value destructive” demerger under which AGL proposes to break off its coal plants into a separate entity to be called Accel Energy. It said the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average price of $6.28 a share. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. AGL’s share price finished Monday up 10.6% to $7.92. It had earlier topped $8 for the first time since mid-July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-20T22:28:40Z","webTitle":"AGL rejects takeover bid by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","fields":{"headline":"AGL rejects takeover bid by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield ","bodyText":"AGL Energy has rejected a takeover bid by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset management giant Brookfield, saying the preliminary offer “materially undervalues the company”. Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures made the extraordinary offer to take over Australia’s most polluting company on Saturday, with a goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. The company said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. Speaking on Monday, Cannon-Brookes said the consortium would continue to work on the potential takeover, which would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring AGL’s power generation and energy retail divisions, which include coal, gas and renewable energy generation assets. If successful, the new owners would aim to bring forward AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy. AGL chairman Peter Botten said the bid did not offer an adequate premium for a change of control of the company. “Under the unsolicited proposal, the board believes AGL Energy shareholders would be forgoing the opportunity to realise potential future value via AGL Energy’s proposed demerger, as both proposed organisations pursue decisive action on decarbonisation.” Cannon-Brookes said the consortium was confident it could close and replace AGL’s coal plants – Bayswater in New South Wales and Loy Yang A in Victoria – by 2030, and take the company to net zero emissions by 2035. “We have $20bn to fund that transition,” he told the ABC’s RN Breakfast. He said it should lead to lower bills for consumers, create more jobs and substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions – more in its own right than Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand, he said. “On a global scale, this is a massive decarbonisation effort. The economics stacks up, the science stacks up. What we require is just the gumption to go it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes said. In a joint statement, Brookfield and Grok Ventures said it was disappointed with AGL’s response, and that its proposal was in the best interests of shareholders as it would avoid a “potentially value destructive” demerger and enable a “well-funded accelerated decarbonisation of Australia’s energy sources”. The consortium said its offer represented about a 20% premium on the three-month volume-weighted average price of $6.28 a share. It promised a transition plan consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5C that would require about $20bn of capital as about 7 gigawatts of fossil fuel capacity was replaced with at least 8GW of clean energy and storage. “It is intended AGL will be net zero by 2035,” the statement said. “The consortium is committed to working with all stakeholders and regulators to ensure the transition is achievable. Serving the company’s customers will remain the primary focus.” Brookfield managing partner Stewart Upson said the consortium had a “defined plan to significantly rationalise” AGL’s carbon-intensive coal plants once they were replaced through a “large-scale renewable build-out, supported by an identified project pipeline”. “To have a material impact on net zero transition, investors need to do more than simply avoid carbon-intensive businesses and we need to be willing to tackle emissions head on,” he said. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, AGL brought forward the planned closure date of the Bayswater black coal plant in NSW to no later than 2033, and Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley to 2045. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025, rather than 2032. Asked about the bid during a visit to Tasmania on Monday, Scott Morrison declared the government did not want ageing coal plants to close early. “We need to ensure that our coal-fired generation of electricity runs to its life, because if it doesn’t, electricity prices go up,” the prime minister said. While cheaper renewable energy generation is one of the factors driving lower power prices, the prime minister said his government was “very committed to sweating those [coal] assets” to ensure reliable electricity supply at affordable prices. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said energy companies were providers of an essential service and had a responsibility to put consumers first. He said driving out “dispatchable” capacity – meaning coal plants – was a significant risk to electricity consumers “both in terms of reliability of the grid and electricity price impacts”. AGL’s share price rose about 12% on Monday morning, topping $8 for the first time since mid-July 2021. The prospect of AGL’s coal plants closing as soon as 2035 is broadly in line with scenarios published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in a draft integrated system plan – a blueprint for the future – published in December. Under its “step change” scenario, brown-coal plants in Victoria would shut by the early 2030s and the final black coal plants by the early 2040s. Speaking alongside Morrison, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg dead-batted a question about whether the proposal could be blocked by the Foreign Investment Review Board. He noted the bid had not yet been approved by AGL shareholders. Brookfield last November secured approval from the foreign investment review board for the $17.8bn takeover of transmission group AusNet Services. Given AGL’s role as a major energy generator and retailer – before the planned demerger – an agreed takeover may also attract attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. AGL’s demerger is being advised by Macquarie Bank, while the Brookfield-Grok duo is being advised by Citi. Cannon-Brookes, a renewable energy investor and vocal advocate for greater action on the climate crisis, previously expressed an interest in backing clean energy assets to replace AGL’s ageing Liddell coal plant, which is due to shut next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-20T06:28:23Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield in bid to take over AGL and shut down coal plants earlier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield in bid to take over AGL and shut down coal plants earlier","bodyText":"Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield have launched an extraordinary joint bid to take over AGL Energy, Australia’s most polluting company, with the goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned.

It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy.

AGL’s demerger is being advised by Macquarie Bank, while the Brookfield-Grok duo is being advised by Citi. AGL, Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes declined to comment. After reports of the takeover bid broke on Sunday afternoon, Cannon-Brookes tweeted: “Might be an afternoon espresso kind of day.” Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said if the AGL takeover went ahead Brookfield “would essentially be an investor, not a manager” and Cannon-Brookes would provide the strategy for the business. Mountain said AGL’s biggest asset was its energy retail business. Of its coal plants, Liddell is due to start shutting down its units later this year ahead of its scheduled closure by April 2023 and Bayswater, while profitable now, would be “a much less attractive asset” after its current low-price black coal subsidy ran out in 2024, he said. He said the fact the opening offer from Brookfield and Grok Ventures had apparently offered little premium above the share price was telling about AGL’s prospects as it struggled to engineer a new vision for the business while dealing with the legacy of old coal plants. The NSW Treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said AGL’s future was a commercial decision. “The NSW government will continue to work with energy companies to maintain system reliability and lower power prices,” he said. Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said businesses were ramping up their investments in renewable energy “because it’s where the smart money is going”. “It’s what the people want and it will further stimulate skills development and new local jobs,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/18/on-coal-plant-closures-the-energy-industry-has-learned-to-keep-angus-taylor-out-of-the-loop","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-17T16:30:42Z","webTitle":"The early closure of Australia’s biggest coal plant caught Angus Taylor by surprise – but it shouldn’t have","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/on-coal-plant-closures-the-energy-industry-has-learned-to-keep-angus-taylor-out-of-the-loop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/18/on-coal-plant-closures-the-energy-industry-has-learned-to-keep-angus-taylor-out-of-the-loop","fields":{"headline":"The early closure of Australia’s biggest coal plant caught Angus Taylor by surprise – but it shouldn’t have","bodyText":"Angus Taylor was refreshingly upfront on Thursday about the extent to which he was sidelined from a major decision affecting the future of Australia’s electricity grid. Speaking to Ray Hadley on Sydney’s 2GB, the federal energy minister said he did not find out about Origin Energy’s decision to shut Australia’s biggest electricity generator, the Eraring coal-fired power plant, seven years earlier than scheduled until the night before. “To find out last night with no warning … I’ve got to tell you, it’s very disappointing,” Taylor said. His New South Wales Liberal counterpart, Matt Kean, also expressed disappointment in Origin’s decision to close the Lake Macquarie plant from 2025, but not shock. He and the company’s chief executive, Frank Calabria, said dialogue between the state government and Origin started months ago. The first contact from the company was in July, and the company requested it be kept confidential. Which, among other things, meant the federal government wasn’t to be told. Origin says there is nothing in this – that the NSW government was the relevant jurisdiction for it to talk with – but it’s no secret that major energy industry players are frustrated with what many see as the federal government’s obstructive and scolding approach to dealing with the historic change under way in how electricity is generated and transmitted. It’s also no secret that Kean and Taylor don’t see eye-to-eye on the best way ahead on electricity. Where the NSW minister talks up the need to act on the climate crisis and promises the country’s biggest renewable energy expansion under legislation passed with cross-party support, Taylor says little about the damage from rising greenhouse gas emissions and mostly emphasises the risks of price spikes and reliability issues in moving away from fossil fuels. It’s important to note those risks are real. No one should assume the shift to a grid that runs overwhelmingly on renewable energy will be straightforward. But emphasis matters, and plenty of experts – from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) down – say the transformation is manageable. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Taylor’s admission he was kept out of the loop on one of biggest decision affecting the electricity grid in recent times suggests Origin learned from the experience of others, particularly AGL. Those lessons include that to be open with the federal government that you plan to shut a coal plant early is to invite pressure to keep it running. The Morrison government’s approach to energy remains piecemeal and inconsistent. It includes building publicly owned hydro and gas plants that discourage private investment while maintaining it is the industry’s responsibility to provide the generation needed. There is no national policy to guide when ageing coal plants should close, or to support coal communities that face inevitable disruption. Instead, some politicians continue to play out a strange pantomime, pretending the country’s official schedule of coal-plant closure dates – which would see many running well into the 2030s, and some the 2040s – remains a meaningful document. In reality, it is widely accepted that many could shut much earlier. Why? The rise of solar has rapidly made coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of free solar energy in the middle of the day, and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. This was the point Calabria was making when he said “rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market” are “increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”. Coal still provides about 60% of generation in the grid and is crucial for its operation, but renewables are coming fast: from about 20% three years ago to more than 31% last year, and 35% in the December quarter. That should reach 69% by the end of the decade, according to federal government projections. Labor, meanwhile, has a $20bn pledge to bring forward the construction of transmission infrastructure to connect new renewable energy zones. Modelling for the ALP suggests the country could hit 82% renewable energy by 2030 if it wins the upcoming election. How many coal plants does that leave room for? The role of supporting cheap variable solar and wind is expected to increasingly be played by things better suited to filling the gaps. They include batteries, pumped hydro schemes, stronger transmission connections, demand management programs and, at least for a while, gas-fired plants. Aemo laid this out in its draft integrated system plan – a blueprint for an optimal grid – in December, when it suggested the step change under way meant coal plants were likely to shut at almost triple the pace officially acknowledged, and estimated the new generation needed to meet future demand. It is not the only view of the future, but nothing in the weeks since has challenged its view that coal is rapidly headed for the door. Two energy giants – AGL last week, and now Origin – have brought forward coal plant official closure dates and renewables have pushed black coal generation to its lowest levels in 23 years. Eraring is particularly in the gun. As Dylan McConnell, a University of Melbourne energy analyst, points out, it is generally the most expensive coal generator in the grid and its output has fallen more rapidly than the rest of the fleet. It is the sort of decline that might grab a federal energy minister’s attention whether directly informed or not. There are two immediate questions that flow from the announcement of Eraring’s exit. The first is whether the NSW government’s response is up to the task. On support for the plant’s 400 workers and their community, it’s too early to say. Both the company and the state government have promised packages, with details to come. On electricity supply, Kean announced the creation of a “transmission acceleration facility” charged with hurrying up the investment being driven by the electricity infrastructure roadmap that passed state parliament in 2020. Its first mission is building a 700MW “Waratah super battery” with a proposed storage capacity of 1400 megawatt hours. Taylor told Hadley it was “delusional” to think a battery could replace a 2880MW coal plant, but Kean said that was not its role – that it would be designed to fix constraints in getting existing generation to Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, not provide energy itself. There was also $84m to bring forward other infrastructure and nearly $50m for pumped hydro projects. Is it enough? It’s early days and some analysts have expressed concern, but Aemo was quick to make its position clear: the state would have access to enough electricity to ensure its energy security target – set to ensure the lights stay on even in disastrous circumstances – could still be met once Eraring is gone. Which is good news – and brings us to the second question. When should we expect the next announcement that a coal plant is closing early? It would be unwise to bet it will take long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-17T15:12:29Z","webTitle":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","bodyText":"The UK’s low-carbon and renewable energy economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data showing a fall in the number of green jobs. In a blow to the government’s pledge to boost net-zero employment opportunities, the Office for National Statistics said its latest figures, covering 2020, showed “no significant change” in turnover and job numbers in the sector compared with six years earlier. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy – which includes manufacturing, energy supply and construction – fell by about 28,000 across the UK over the period, to just 207,800. Among the steepest declines were in factories producing energy-efficient products, onshore wind, and solar energy. Trade unions raised questions over the government’s plan to boost Britain’s low-carbon economy after years of limited progress. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the UK had an opportunity to be a pioneer on the path to net zero. “But we will miss out on these opportunities if ministers do not step up public investment and action. And we could see existing jobs lost to other countries who modernise their industry faster,” she added. Although the latest snapshot includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic – when the British economy plunged into the deepest recession for 100 years – the figures show that in 2019, before the health emergency struck, green business turnover also fell compared with a year earlier. According to the latest data, the sector with the largest growth in jobs was in low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, where employment more than doubled to 19,100. However, this was not enough to offset bigger falls elsewhere, including a decline of more than a quarter, or 32,000, in the number of jobs in energy-efficient product manufacturing. The number of green businesses operating in the UK fell by 13% over the six-year period, while the combined turnover for the low-carbon economy fell by almost 6% to £41.2bn. The ONS said the fall in turnover was largely driven by the energy-efficient products and low-emissions vehicles sectors. The majority of businesses in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors are in manufacturing and construction, both of which suffered a downturn in 2020. However, it said employment should have been less affected than turnover because the figures included staff on furlough. While green sectors including offshore wind have recorded substantial growth in recent years, with a sharp rise in renewable energy production, critics argue that much of the activity has been driven by foreign companies, with a reliance on the UK importing turbine blades and components manufactured abroad. Boris Johnson announced an ambition in late 2020 to create 250,000 green jobs across the country through a 10-point plan, as part of a wider government drive to hit net zero and embed a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Ministers are seeking to encourage the growth of green jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, including through the creation of freeports in an attempt to boost investment and jobs in the low-carbon economy. However, experts and campaigners have warned the government’s net zero plans lack the required ambition and are not backed up with adequate funding from the Treasury, instead relying on the private sector. A UK government spokesperson said: “Over the last three decades, the UK has achieved record clean growth. Our economy has grown by 77%, while our emissions have decreased by 44% - faster than any other G7 nation. “Against the backdrop of the worst economic recession in a lifetime and an unprecedented pandemic, the low carbon economy has continued to support 430,000 jobs across the UK. We’ve already seen 56,000 jobs created and supported in green sectors last year, including in offshore wind and electric vehicle manufacturing. “As we recover from the pandemic, we are unlocking £90bn of private investment to continue to support the creation of new jobs in new British industries, such as Gigafactories, offshore wind, and nuclear power generation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-09T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Gas-fired power falls to lowest level since 2005 as Coalition pushes ahead with its ‘gas-fired recovery’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Gas-fired power falls to lowest level since 2005 as Coalition pushes ahead with its ‘gas-fired recovery’","bodyText":"The sharp rise of renewable energy led to it providing more than 30% of Australia’s electricity in 2021, while gas-fired power fell to its lowest level in 16 years. Data collected by OpenNEM, an open source platform, shows renewable energy provided 31.4% of electricity within the national market covering the eastern states and South Australia last year. It was 32.2% in the separate West Australian grid. The national figure has quickly surged beyond the national renewable energy target, which required electricity retailers to sell about 23% of generation from solar, wind and hydro plants by 2020. Gas-fired power – which is being backed by the Morrison government through hundreds of millions of dollars in funding as part of what it calls a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic – has fallen to its lowest level of generation since 2005. It now provides just 5.7% of the total. Its decline from a high of 12.8% seven years ago is largely attributed to its relatively high cost and the sharp increase in the amount of cheaper solar and wind energy available. Coal-fired power provides 62.8% of electricity, its lowest level in both proportion and total amount since the interconnected national market began in 1999. Back then, it was 95.4% of grid generation. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said renewable energy had increased dramatically since 2018, when it was about 20% of the total share. The surge had initially been largely driven by a rush to fill the national renewable energy target, which the Morrison government did not extend or replace. It had continued due to the plunging cost of solar and wind, state-based renewables schemes and corporates increasingly promising support for zero-emissions energy. “Electricity is now the cheapest it has been in almost a decade, and we have solar and wind to thank for that,” Baxter said. The most significant rise has been in household solar systems. More than 3m homes have photovoltaic panels, including at least 360,000 systems installed last year, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Regulators say that has created some new grid management challenges as solar energy floods into the system and makes other forms of generation uncompetitive when the sun is high in the middle of the day. Solar energy provided 12.3% of electricity generated in the national market. Nearly two-thirds of that came from rooftops, the rest from large-scale farms. Wind contributed 11.3% of electricity and hydro power 7.8%. Gas-fired fall In contrast, gas-fired power had declined due to it being the most expensive electricity fuel available. Baxter said while there may be some year-to-year variation, the fall in its use for power was expected to continue as other “dispatchable” sources that could be called on when required became available. They included pumped hydro, batteries, virtual power plants and demand response programs. Baxter said it made the government’s support for gas power – including $600m for a new gas-fired generator at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley and another four listed for potential public underwriting – look “increasingly irresponsible and economically reckless”. “Let’s be clear, this record [of solar and wind lowering electricity prices] has nothing to do with the federal government, which has been missing in action and leaving all the heavy lifting to the states and territories,” he said. The Kurri Kurri gas plant, to be built by the public owned Snowy Hydro company, has been criticised as unnecessary to ensure a secure electricity supply is maintained once the nearby Liddell coal plant shuts next year. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, was among those who said a new gas plant in the Hunter did not make commercial sense given there were cheaper and cleaner alternatives, but the head of Snowy Hydro, Paul Broad, this week predicted the country would continue to build “a lot more” gas-fired stations. Federal Labor last week said if it won the upcoming federal election it would require the Kurri Kurri station to run on 30% green hydrogen made with renewable energy when it opened next year, and 100% green hydrogen as soon as possible. Chris Bowen, the opposition energy and climate spokesman, said this could cost up to another $700m, inflating the potential total to $1.3bn. Green hydrogen has been widely backed as a significant future energy source as the world cuts greenhouse gas emissions, but some experts have ranked electricity generation near the bottom of its likely commercially viable uses. It is seen as important in creating “green” steel, aluminium and ammonia, among other products. Labor has also promised a $20 billion off-budget “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the construction of planned electricity grid links. Modelling for the opposition by the firm RepuTex suggested it could lead to renewable energy providing 82% of electricity by 2030, compared with 68% on the current trajectory under the federal Coalition. The Greens say the country should be aiming for 100%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/09/us-poultry-giant-tyson-farmland-twice-size-new-jersey-feed-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-09T11:30:04Z","webTitle":"US poultry giant Tyson using land ‘twice the size of New Jersey’ for animal feed, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/us-poultry-giant-tyson-farmland-twice-size-new-jersey-feed-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/09/us-poultry-giant-tyson-farmland-twice-size-new-jersey-feed-animals","fields":{"headline":"US poultry giant Tyson using land ‘twice the size of New Jersey’ for animal feed, study says","bodyText":"Tyson Foods utilizes between nine and 10m acres of farmland – an area almost twice the size of New Jersey – to produce corn and soybeans to feed the more than 2 billion animals it processes every year in the US alone, according to new research. The study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) published on Wednesday also estimates that only about 5% of this land, 408,000 acres, has been enrolled in sustainable farming programs announced by Tyson in 2018. The UCS findings are based on calculations of the amount of corn and soybeans Tyson required to feed the approximately 6 million head of cattle, 22 million hogs and nearly 2 billion chickens it processed in the US in 2020, drawing on data reported by Tyson. Most consumers do not appreciate how much land is needed exclusively to support industrial animal farming and the wider environmental impacts of that, said Marcia DeLonge, a senior scientist in the food and environment program at the UCS and co-author of the report. “We are using this land in a way that creates a lot of pollution and a lot of problems that contribute to climate change,” DeLonge said. Tyson Foods did not respond to requests to comment on the UCS research and questions about its crop feed footprint. Gidon Eshel, research professor of Environmental Physics at Bard College, said the scale of farming needed to produce animal feed contributes to many of the environmental problems of large-scale agriculture. These issues include changes to soil and the natural flow of water, the way solar energy relates to the earth, and disruption of plants and animals. Pollution from fertilizers and pesticides are another big concern, and the risks of contaminating drinking water and harming ecosystems. In 2020, 174m acres were used exclusively to plant corn and soybeans in the US – an area larger than Texas, which accounts for 56% of the US’s 310m total cropland acres – according to the UCS report. Some of these crops are used for biofuel and processed foods but, according to the US Department of Agriculture, most is used for feed crops. “Because [this land] could otherwise be used to grow foods eaten by people, feed crop production ultimately affects everyone,” the report said. There is a significant opportunity cost in growing feed crops, Eshel said. “If you produce 100lbs of corn and feed it to beef, you get 3lbs of edible beef. Because of this, using land to grow feed crops instead of food [for humans] is incredibly questionable – it’s wasteful,” he said. While Tyson itself does not own feed crop farms, its influence over the thousands of farmers in its supply chain is huge. The company, which produces about 20% of the pork, beef and chicken consumed in the US, is one of the nation’s largest buyers of feed. In 2018, the company announced a commitment to “support improved environmental practices” on 2m acres of corn it uses for feed crops by the end of 2020. Tyson said the pledge would “encourage grain farmers to adopt more efficient fertilizer practices, and take additional measures to reduce water runoff and soil loss”. Tom Hayes, the company’s then CEO, said in a statement at the time: “The world needs a more sustainable food system, and we believe it’s up to big companies like ours to set the pace with bold goals.” Today, however, only 408,000 acres have been enrolled into pilot sustainability programs and the company has pushed its deadline to meet the 2m mark to 2025, mainly citing Covid-related delays. Tyson’s dominant position means the company could be a leader in sustainable food practices but its current efforts fall short, said DeLonge. “Two million acres is an important step, but not only did they delay that goal, they’ve also only come through on 408,000 acres.” Even if Tyson achieves its 2m acre pledge, this land is only a fraction of the company’s overall impact. According to UCS’s estimates, Tyson’s total feed crop footprint is more than five times larger and close to 23 times the size of its current progress. DeLonge also questioned the lack of detail in Tyson’s pledge. “Enrolling those acres into sustainability pilot programs is a good first step, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those acres are being managed in a way that is truly sustainable,” she said. Tyson Foods recently set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Sustainable feed crop farming means growing crops without damaging the environment, degrading resources or exploiting people, said DeLonge. “Achieving this would mean building and maintaining healthy soils, managing water wisely, minimizing pollution, promoting biodiversity and treating workers with dignity and respect,” she said. Last August the Guardian and UCS published a joint investigation which showed how Tyson’s near monopoly in its home state of Arkansas gives it huge power, at a cost to farmers and the environment. Tyson Food at the time defended its record as an employer and pointed to the economic activity the meat industry created. The new UCS report said that the environmental impact of croplands management can become worse in the face of farmland consolidation, explaining that for decades, the land used to grow crops has been merged into fewer and larger farms, undermining rural economies and communities across the US. “When a single company, like Tyson, has so much leverage over so much farmland, their actions can have substantial consequences,” said DeLonge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-08T06:28:14Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Johnson blamed over mobbing of Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Johnson blamed over mobbing of Starmer","bodyText":"Top story: No 10’s new PR ‘lobbied for Huawei’ Hello, I’m Warren Murray, and I hope this will help you feel more on top of things. MPs from all sides have accused Boris Johnson of whipping up political poison after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was set upon by protesters who accused him of protecting the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded him near parliament with shouts of “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. The former chief whip Julian Smith described the events as appalling and said the prime minister’s false Savile slurs must be “withdrawn in full”. Johnson said the behaviour directed at Starmer was “absolutely disgraceful” and “completely unacceptable” but once again stopped short of apologising. Johnson is expected to reshuffle his team today including possibly sacking the chief whip, Mark Spencer. The prime minister will also continue a No 10 overhaul after recruiting Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, as his chief of staff, and Guto Harri, his former spokesperson, as his new director of communications. Harri has drawn criticism from Labour over his previous job for a lobbying firm that worked for Huawei, the company linked to the Chinese Communist party that has been banned from the UK’s 5G mobile network. * * * Diplomacy but no detente – Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin had nothing in the way of a breakthrough to show for five hours of talks at the Kremlin on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Macron, the French president, is due today in Kyiv to hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has met with Joe Biden at the White House. Biden insisted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would be shut down if Russia attacked, but Scholz would not be so specific. Biden said of Putin: “I know that he’s in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv. He has the capacity to do that. What he’s going to do I don’t know.” The president advised US civilians to leave Ukraine, saying: “I don’t want them to get caught in the crossfire.” As the Russian build-up continues, Britain has agreed to send a further 350 troops to Poland. * * * Over-18 checks on porn sites – British users of pornography websites would have to provide credit card or passport details to prove they are over 18 under revived plans. Ministers have said the forthcoming online safety bill will cover commercial porn sites, updating draft legislation that now applies to providers of user-generated pornography such as OnlyFans. More than a third of the British population are estimated to watch online pornography, according to estimates by the age verification industry, meaning age checking could be both an enormous technical challenge and potentially big business. * * * High street faces hit – Britain’s biggest retailers have warned the cost of living crisis will mean consumers tightening their purse strings over the coming months. Households already grappling with rising energy bills, petrol prices, tax, mortgage payments and rent can also expect to pay more for groceries this year. Supermarkets are responding by cutting back on staff costs; squeezing farmers and other suppliers not to increase their prices; “shrinkflation” tactics such as reducing the amount in a pack of peanuts while keeping the price the same; and cutting out unnecessary product lines. And while it won’t solve the energy price crunch, thousands of homes could soon be paid to halve their electricity usage during high-demand times. Octopus Energy and the National Grid are to trial the scheme. * * * Toxins in tap water – Drinking water containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals known as PFOS was piped into the homes of more than 1,000 people in south Cambridgeshire, the Guardian can reveal. The aquifer supplying the affected houses, close to Duxford airfield, was found to have PFOS levels at almost 400 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of water – four times the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s limit. Cambridge Water has admitted it removed the supply in June last year and said the exposure was under investigation. It admitted it had not told the community but said it had blended the water with another source. It would not say how long the villages had been drinking the contaminated supply, only that modelling and sampling undertaken in 2020 suggested the levels were previously below 100ng/l. PFOS has been associated with increased cholesterol, low birthweight and suppressed immune response. In the past it was used in firefighting foams, including at airfields. Defra, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency declined to comment. * * * Runs like it’s on rails – The Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief has said, amid speculation that the £18.9bn Crossrail project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. As trials continue, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian’s transport correspondent, has taken a trip on the line, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street. The official deadline for opening is the end of June. Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability. Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” Today in Focus podcast: Hooked on crypto With endorsements from celebrities and ads on TikTok, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream.

Adani has overtaken fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani to enter the top 10 of the world’s richest people, according to figures from Forbes and Bloomberg, after seeing his personal fortune rise by $12bn in the past year. Among the mega-rich whom Adani has leapfrogged to reach the world top 10 are Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who slipped down the table several places last week after losing $30bn of his personal fortune. Although Adani has become the face of big coal around the world with its pursuit of the hugely controversial Carmichael mine project in Australia, the mogul’s ascent into the top echelons of world billionaires is down to his expansion of green investments. His Adani Group controls the port of Mundra, India’s largest, in the mogul’s home state of Gujarat and he also owns 74% of Mumbai international airport. But his push into green energy has paid off handsomely in the past year with the listed company Adani Green Energy now his most valuable after its share price almost doubled in the past 12 months. The group is in the process of ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer. Adani found his ambitions dovetailed with those of Indian prime minister and fellow Gujarati, Narendra Modi, who leveraged India’s huge uptake in solar power to map out more ambitious goals for cutting carbon emissions at the Glasgow climate conference in November. India plans to reach a target of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and that 50% of electricity capacity would come from renewables by the same point. It plans to be net-zero by 2070. Overseas investors in Adani and India’s solar revolution include the French oil company Total, which last year bought 20% of Adani Green Energy. “The Adani Group has spotted and entered all the happening sectors at the right time, which has appealed to a select band of foreign portfolio investors,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at Mumbai-based brokerage HDFC Securities Ltd, told Bloomberg. “The sectors are capital-intensive and the company has faced little difficulty in raising funds to expand.” Despite the greener outlook for Adani, the group is still pressing ahead with the giant Queensland mine in the face of fierce resistance from a rainbow coalition of anti-fossil fuel activists, biodiversity conservationists and Indigenous groups. The bitter battle over the mine has seen a succession of on-site protests, legal battles, and the use of a private investigator by the company to secretly photograph the family of activists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
