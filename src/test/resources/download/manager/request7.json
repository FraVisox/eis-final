First, he bought a piece of land in the countryside of Bucchianico, near the town of Chieti in Abruzzo, where he and his wife started building their personal Shire from JRR Tolkien’s fictional Middle-earth. Then, on 27 August, alongside a group of friends and Lord of the Rings fans dressed as an elf, a dwarf, a hobbit, a sorcerer and humans, he walked more than 120 miles (200km) from Chieti to Naples, crossing mountains and rivers, to throw the “One Ring”, a central plot element of The Lord of the Rings saga, into the volcano crater of Mount Vesuvius. “Some time ago, I realised that books and films were no longer enough for me to satisfy my passion for the fantasy genre and, in particular, for the Lord of the Rings saga,” Gentile said. “I was still reading about the lives of other people. I decided that I wanted to live my hobbit life to the fullest.” In the two hectares of land he bought, he has already built his first house, where he lives with his family, in hobbit clothes, and his doors are also open to visitors. Here, the pastry chef, who has a degree in geology, plans to build the caravan of the dwarves, the green dragon inn and a large version of Bilbo Baggins’ house. His goal is to transform this piece of Abruzzo into a hobbit village, with an adjoining farmhouse, where visitors will be able to live in a magical world, which, according to Gentile, is not too far from the way people live in Bucchianico. “Over time, I realised that my friends, my relatives and the farmers of Bucchianico have always lived as hobbits. They work like hobbits, carrying out jobs that are all in close contact with nature. They celebrate like hobbits, by organising festivals and dances and even dress up as hobbits.” In Bucchianico, the festival of the Banderesi is organised every year. It is one of the oldest festivals in Europe – celebrated for almost 500 years and in which people wear medieval clothes, sing songs, dance and prepare typical local dishes. “Those are hobbit clothes,” says Gentile. ‘‘I realised that I have always lived in the Shire. The only thing missing was to become aware of it and build a village. I wanted people to enter my mind, my fantasy. Many make fun of us. Some think I am trying to escape from reality. Far from it. I am living my dream, my adventure. By purchasing that piece of land, I have removed it from a reality that I don’t like and am shaping it the way I want.” He says his “county” will be called the Contea Gentile, because of a copyright issue. The houses will be built through crowdfunding and will be sustainable, using solar energy. Like a true hobbit, Gentile loves nature and his goal is to take care of it. He says his journey to Vesuvius to throw the ring into the crater was not just an extravagant walk by Lord of the Rings fans – he wanted to send a message. “The earth today is threatened by pollution and the climate emergency, which are enemies as fearsome as Sauron. We wanted to show that our land, like Tolkien’s Middle-earth, must be saved and protected. That’s why we went there to throw the ring. I’m too much of an environmentalist to throw a piece of iron into nature, so I symbolically threw a piece of solidified lava into the crater and gave the ring to a little boy we met. “We met a lot of people over the course of those hundreds of kilometres. And the affection they showed us was incredible. The people on the street opened the doors to their houses for us, gave us food, offered to host us in their houses and let us take a shower. What is this if not magic?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/03/big-oil-hurricane-ida-flood-victims-thoughts-prayers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-03T15:36:15Z","webTitle":"What are big oil companies sending to Hurricane Ida flood victims? 'Thoughts and prayers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/03/big-oil-hurricane-ida-flood-victims-thoughts-prayers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/03/big-oil-hurricane-ida-flood-victims-thoughts-prayers","fields":{"headline":"Exxon slammed as climate hypocrites for sending ‘thoughts and prayers’ to Ida victims ","bodyText":"Major oil companies are being pilloried on social media for sending “thoughts and prayers” to victims of Hurricane Ida while sidestepping their role in the ongoing climate disaster. At least two ExxonMobil outposts – from Beaumont and Baytown, Texas – tweeted the message on Monday, using the hashtag #LouisianaStrong. It didn’t take long for Twitter users to call out the company for its tone-deaf response, noting that Exxon’s own internal research program predicted catastrophic climate change decades ago. Moreover, in the last 80 years, Louisiana has lost roughly 2,000 square miles of its coastal wetlands, according to the US Geological Survey. The major factors contributing to the decline of the natural storm barrier are offshore oil rigs, onshore wells and refineries operating on the shoreline. The death toll from Hurricane Ida is now nearing 50, after the storm tore a path through the south, mid-Atlantic and north-eastern US. This is not the first time the fossil fuel industry has been rebuked for sending “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of disasters exacerbated by climate change. For years, as the climate crisis has intensified, oil companies have extended social media messages of sympathy without addressing climate change and the role of fossil fuel emissions as the root of the problem. Chevron’s Houston account extended its “thoughts” in the midst of a deadly category 4 Hurricane Laura last August. In 2017 during Hurricane Harvey, Exxon encouraged Texas and Louisiana to “stay strong”. Scientists say that both disasters were intensified by the impacts of a changing climate. Ahead of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released earlier this month, and its dire warning that global heating will probably reach 1.5C within the next two decades, oil companies filled their feeds with renewable energy pledges, claims of green accomplishments and sustainability buzzwords. The average social media user perusing BP’s tweets on solar energy just days before the report’s release might have been surprised to learn that the “P” in the company’s name once stood for petroleum, and that even in a decade’s time its investments in renewable energy are expected to amount to less than half of its total capital investments today. Offering “thoughts and prayers” on social media in response to tragedy is now commonly associated with reactions to US gun violence – and is considered by some activists to be a pale substitute for concrete action. Exxon is currently facing lawsuits that allege “deceptive marketing” and “greenwashing” – the practice of marketing a company or a product as environmentally friendly to hide a true record of fossil fuel emissions and polluting. Fossil fuel facilities are in fact vulnerable to extreme weather. When millions of Texans were left freezing after a severe winter storm and power outage earlier this year, fossil fuel energy-generating stations were knocked offline and oil refineries, chemical manufacturers and other industrial plants in the state emitted about 3.5m pounds of excess pollutants into the air. Oil and gas regulators nevertheless rushed to defend the industry’s image of “reliability”, according to Texas Tribune, instead blaming wind power, which accounts for less than 24% of the state’s energy, and the progressive left for the power outages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-01T12:27:25Z","webTitle":"Opec member urges oil producers to focus more on renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Opec member urges oil producers to focus more on renewable energy","bodyText":"The finance minister of Iraq, one of the founding members of the global oil cartel Opec, has made an unprecedented call to fellow oil producers to move away from fossil fuel dependency and into renewable energy, ahead of a key Opec meeting. Ali Allawi, who is also the deputy prime minister of Iraq, has written in the Guardian to urge oil producers to pursue “an economic renewal focused on environmentally sound policies and technologies” that would include solar power and potentially nuclear reactors, and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel exports. Along with the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, he wrote: “To stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas … If oil revenues start to decline before producer countries have successfully diversified their economies, livelihoods will be lost and poverty rates will increase.” Ministers of the 13 Opec member states are scheduled to meet virtually on Wednesday to negotiate potential curbs to production, as oil prices waver. Opec had earlier agreed to boost production as economies recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, but slowing markets have led some to suggest a halt to the increase. The US president, Joe Biden, controversially called for Opec to increase oil production further last month, to keep oil prices from rising and assist with the US economic recovery. His plea was rejected. The Guardian understands Wednesday’s Opec meeting may also discuss the climate crisis, in an unusual move for the fossil fuel producers, before vital UN climate talks called Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow in November. Allawi and Birol suggested current oil price volatility, driven by the pandemic, was only the beginning of problems for producers. The climate crisis will not only require a move away from oil, but will strike the Middle East and north Africa particularly badly, where rising temperatures are already causing severe problems. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 found that global demand for oil was likely to plunge from more than 90m barrels per day to fewer than 25m by 2050, resulting in a potential 85% drop in revenues for oil-producing economies. “In a region with one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations in the world, economic hardship and increasing unemployment risk creating broader unrest and instability,” Allawi and Birol wrote. An alternative to remaining tied to increasingly volatile oil prices would be to invest in renewables, especially solar power. “The energy sector could play a role here by making use of the region’s vast potential for producing and supplying clean energy,” they wrote. Iraq is a founder member of the cartel that includes many of the world’s biggest producers, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Nigeria and several other African oil-producing states. The Opec+ grouping also includes Russia and some smaller producers. Most have been hostile to calls for action on climate change, while some have been dismissive of climate science and Saudi Arabia, in particular, has frequently been obstructive to UN negotiations on global climate action. The IEA warned in May that for the world to stay within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower limit set out in the Paris agreement – to which all Opec members are signatories – then all new oil exploration must cease from this year. Asked about the findings, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters after an Opec meeting in June: “I would have to express my view that I believe it is a sequel of [the] La La Land movie … Why should I take it seriously?” In the past, Saudi ministers have flirted with climate action, for instance suggesting that the country could power itself with solar energy in future. But none have seriously suggested a policy to cease oil exports. However, some oil producers have taken a more dovish stance. Oman, which is no longer an Opec member, is pursuing hydrogen as a potential low-carbon fuel for the future. UAE is also working on hydrogen, and boosting renewables, and recently inaugurated a new nuclear plant. Egypt, Morocco and Jordan are among other countries in the region with sizeable renewable energy programmes. Birol, one of the world’s leading energy economists, told the Guardian: “More than at any point in history, fundamental changes to the economic model in resource-rich countries look unavoidable. Countries in the region have been making some efforts on the energy transition. There are promising initiatives [among oil producers], but as is the case for many other countries around the world, reaching net zero emissions will require much stronger actions and much greater international collaboration.” He added: “The IEA has been warning for many years that countries that rely heavily on oil and gas revenues need to move quickly to diversify their economies away from fossil fuels to keep pace with the transition to clean energy. The impact of Covid on the oil market last year gave us a fleeting image of what the region’s economies could look like in the future in a world where demand for oil and gas is structurally weaker – and where countries do not take serious measures to diversify their economies and increase their resilience.” On Wednesday oil prices fell slightly after analysts said they expected Opec to stick to its plan of gradually increasing oil production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-26T10:22:45Z","webTitle":"What if it's too late to save our planet without geoengineering? | Moira Donegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","fields":{"headline":"What if it’s too late to save our planet without geoengineering?","bodyText":"The realities of climate change are front-page news every day. Temperature records are being smashed. Wildfires are raging. There is no sign of things going back to “normal”. If anything, they will only get worse. Last year, when the planet was convulsing with the arrival of a pandemic, we pinned our hopes on technology – in the form of an mRNA vaccine – getting us out of our crisis. The vaccine was a technological intervention, injected into the arms of billions of people. Could we (should we?) look to technological solutions to our climate crisis, too? This is the question posed by Holly Jean Buck in her 2019 book, After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy, Repair, and Restoration. Zooming with me from Buffalo, New York, where she’s a professor of environment at the University of Buffalo, Buck is blunt in her assessment. The pace of climate change, and the insufficiency of humanity’s current response, have effectively already made the choice for us: mankind will have to engage in some kind of “geoengineering” – an umbrella term for various methods of intentional, planetary-scale climate intervention – whether we like it or not. Geoengineering refers to any number of ways that humans can change our climate through interventions. The two main types of geoengineering are carbon engineering, which aims to suck carbon out of the atmosphere, and solar engineering, which aims to reflect solar energy away from Earth. “We’re in a climate crisis,” she tells me. “Mitigation isn’t going fast enough. Adaptation needs far more support than it’s getting. It’s clear that we need to remove some amount of carbon from the atmosphere.” How much? “Hundreds of billions of tons,” Buck says. “We have emitted so much, and now we have so much legacy carbon. The challenge isn’t just cutting emissions.” The second challenge is “removing the carbon that’s up there. It’s this massive cleanup operation that we need to undertake this century.” The idea of deliberately altering the climate can be frightening and distasteful, including to many environmentalists. But Buck argues that climate engineering is coming whether we like it or not. “If people on the environmental left – people who care about climate change – just reject all of these approaches out of hand, then we lose the ability to shape them, which would be a grave mistake,” she says. The simplest form of geoengineering is the kind of carbon removal many of us learned about in school: planting trees. “Land-based solutions are really important, especially in the next decade or so, because they can be implemented quickly – and we know how to plant forests,” Buck says. She points to other kinds of land-based climate interventions that show promise. Changing agricultural practices can be used to store more carbon in the dirt. Other strategies include storing carbon in wetlands, ocean iron fertilization, or different approaches involving rock weathering. But land-based solutions, though a helpful beginning, probably won’t be enough, Buck says. To plant enough trees to soak up enough carbon to sufficiently cool our planet, we would have to fundamentally change the way we use land in ways that would make our economy and many of our lives unrecognizable. And there are other risks to relying too heavily on land-based techniques. “A lot of land-based approaches are vulnerable to climate change itself,” Buck explains. “You don’t want a wildfire to wipe out these removals that you’ve been banking on, right?” Massive reforestation efforts could go up in smoke. But land-based solutions are not the only option. Carbon removal can also be accomplished with industrial technologies. Buck points to a carbon mitigation strategy called geological carbon capture, which is already widely used to reduce the emissions of heavily polluting industries. “You could outfit, well, scrubbers basically, on a factory, and these collect carbon dioxide. Then you inject [the carbon] underground, into a cavern, and keep it there, under the rock, for a very long time. You keep monitoring it, to make sure it stays where you want it to be.” There are risks to injecting large amounts of carbon into rock; Buck laments the under-regulated “wild west atmosphere” of fracking, which caused earthquakes in some parts of the US. But scientists have learned from that experience, and technologies exist to keep underground carbon in place. And new techniques may make geological carbon capture safer. “There’s a lot of new research about how to get carbon dioxide to turn into rock quicker once you inject it” underground, Buck says. This is a carbon mitigation technique that has proved efficient in reducing emissions at an industrial scale, and it has been in use for decades, meaning that the safety and science of the technique are well understood. Buck’s hope is that this technology could advance and be used not just for mitigating carbon emissions, but for removing carbon. “It becomes carbon removal” – as opposed to mitigation – “if you’re removing the carbon just from the ambient air,” Buck says. There are now machines that can “scrub” carbon out of the air; the carbon can then be transported and stored underground. Without these machines, the technique can also be used to create bioenergy, which involves “producing biomass” – say, a very carbon-dense type of plant – “and combusting it at a power plant, and separating out the carbon and storing it underground again”. This strategy – using a spectrum of carbon-engineering techniques to inject carbon deep beneath rock - is the most effective and safest, Buck believes. But unless humanity gets its act together soon, we may forced to entertain much riskier climate mitigation strategies. “If we don’t remove carbon, and decarbonize, and reform how we use land, and rework our transportation systems, and change industrial systems fast enough,” Buck says, “then there’s the possibility that people will pitch the idea of solar geoengineering.” Solar geoengineering is a kind of climate mitigation – thus far theoretical – that involves “blocking a fraction of incoming sunlight and sending it back out into space, which has a cooling effect”. Most solar-engineering techniques involve using special planes to inject gas into the stratosphere. The gas particles would reflect sunlight away, changing both the quantity and the quality of sunlight that reaches earth. This kind of geoengineering would certainly cool the planet, at least for a while. But it would not solve the fundamental problem of too much carbon in the atmosphere. “It doesn’t get to the root,” says Buck. “It doesn’t remove emissions. It’s just a blanket of intentional pollution that cools things down.” And solar geoengineering might create other problems, Buck says. What would a different kind of sunlight do to humankind, or to other living creatures? What would it do to agriculture, and our food supply? We don’t know. Would there be food shortages? Would the sky still be blue? We don’t have those answers, and solar geoengineering remains a risky proposition until we do. How optimistic is Buck that humanity will attain a livable future without having to resort to solar geoengineering? More than I expected. The vision that she articulates is ambitious. It would require international cooperation and vast overhauls of infrastructure. It would also mean that the United States and other capitalist countries would have to reorient themselves to a more centrally planned economy, devoted less to maximizing growth than to minimizing carbon. It would mean overcoming vast political differences and competing incentives the world over in order to unite in global common cause. But Buck thinks that the incentives for cooperation in the existential climate intervention project are great enough to ensure at least some success. “I do think that if people share a common goal, they might disagree about how to reach that goal, but maybe just having the common goal is enough,” she says. The greatest cleanup operation of history – the cleanup of carbon in our atmosphere – may well happen within our lifetimes. And, if Buck is right, there is no better time to start it than right now. • This article was amended on 1 September 2021. When answering the question about how much carbon needed to be removed from the atmosphere, Buck meant to say hundreds of billions of tons, not hundreds of billions of gigatons as quoted in an earlier version.

However, those thinking about signing up need to be prepared to accept some risk to their cash. This is a lot riskier than a bank or building society savings account. The investments include a scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy, and one involving a company that has found a way to grow “greener” tomatoes in the UK. Energise Africa enables people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For first-time investors, Energise Africa is currently guaranteeing investments up to £100. Launched in 2017, Energise Africa is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. This involves putting your money into bonds (mainly unsecured, although some are secured) that are not listed on a public market. The minimum investment is £50. At the time of writing, there were several projects on the Energise Africa website either open for investment or about to go live. There is a 30-month bond from a solar company called Oolu, based in Senegal, with an expected interest rate of 7% a year. Oolu aims to raise just over £112,000 and says the money will help it provide solar home systems to 432 families in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a company called Sollatek in Kenya is offering a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. It says it is aiming to raise £40,000, so it can make 200 solar home systems available to families in rural Kenya. Also still open to investors at the time of writing was a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 6% that aims to raise £500,000. It has been launched by a Kenya-based agricultural supply chain company called iProcure. Lisa Ashford, the chief executive of Energise Africa and Ethex, says: “We’ve definitely seen an increase in people investing across both our platforms since the beginning of the pandemic. There are multiple factors at play, including low interest rates, but we’ve seen lots of new customers that want to support initiatives that can have a direct benefit on their community or a positive impact on the environment. The recent UN climate report and events such as the Greek wildfires put this into perspective.” The guarantee on offer to new investors will reassure some, although above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Meanwhile, individuals concerned about the environmental cost of food production are being targeted by a new investment offering 8% interest a year. On offer is an opportunity to put money into Sterling Suffolk, a company building and operating carbon-capturing glasshouses that grow “greener” tomatoes. The investment has been launched by the crowdfunding platform Abundance Investment, and the aim is to raise up to £6.75m. In the UK we eat more than 500,000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes each year but only grow 20% of them here. We rely on imports all year round, and this has a high environmental cost. The UK imports most of its tomatoes from countries such as the Netherlands that operate gas-heated greenhouses, or places such as Spain that benefit from lower heating requirements but have other major environmental impacts including transport and water usage. Based in Bramford, near Ipswich, Sterling Suffolk is tackling this issue head-on. Its semi-closed glasshouses are the first of their kind in the UK and use 25% less energy per tonne of tomatoes than other conventional glasshouses while capturing and reusing at least 75% of the CO2 generated from heating, a spokesman says. The minimum investment is £5, and those who put their money in will be buying tradeable debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, debentures are not covered by the FSCS or the FOS and, again, there is a risk you may not get back the money you invested or make any return on your investment. The quoted 8% return assumes you hold the debentures until maturity in October 2032. According to the offer document, someone investing £1,000 now would be in line to receive a total of £1,555 at maturity – ie their original capital plus £555 of interest income. These debentures are secured, in contrast to some other Abundance investments that are unsecured, and can be sold on to other investors free of charge via the Abundance Marketplace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-16T11:00:34Z","webTitle":"Imagining the climate-proof home in the US: using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","fields":{"headline":"Imagining the climate-proof home in the US: using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources","bodyText":"Dealing with the climate crisis involves the overhauling of many facets of life, but few of these changes will feel as tangible and personal as the transformation required within the home. The 128m households that dot America gobble up energy for heating, cooling and lighting, generating around 20% of all the planet-heating emissions produced in the US. Americans typically live in larger, more energy hungry dwellings than people in other countries, using more than double the energy of the average Briton and 10 times that of the average Chinese person. This sizable contribution is now coming under the scrutiny of Joe Biden’s administration, which recently put forward a raft of measures to build and upgrade 2m low-emissions homes. “Decarbonizing buildings is a big task but it’s an essential task,” said Michael Regan, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rapid change will be needed to avoid disastrous climate change. To get to zero emissions by the middle of the century, the sale of fossil fuel boilers will have to end within five years, all new buildings will have to run on clean electricity by 2030 and half of all existing buildings will have to be fully retrofitted by 2040, a recent landmark International Energy Agency report warned. “The appliances we use at home have tended to be overlooked but they are contributing a significant amount to climate change and we need to address that,” said Mike Henchen, an expert in carbon-free buildings at RMI. “That will touch people’s lives – our homes are our refuges, the places we know best. But hopefully the change will also make people’s homes more comfortable, safer and healthier, as well as reduce the climate impact.” So what will the climate-adapted homes of the future look like? Designing the home to use less – and cleaner – energy Changes on both the outside and inside of our structures will shape the future of climate-proof homes. According to Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, homes will have to follow three interlocking mantras: “using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources at the right time”. Solar panels on roofs will become more common while, in rented or apartment accommodation, community solar schemes could provide an alternative. Solar panels can also be married with home batteries to help store excess energy which, along with proper insulation, will help keep a house functioning even during the sort of lengthy power blackouts Texas experienced earlier this year. Such a scenario opens up the possibility of utility companies operating an automated network of homes, as is the case in parts of Vermont, to manage demand and supply, rather than rely on hulking centralized infrastructure. “Having solar panels, batteries and water heaters all orchestrated and distributed makes the home a part of the energy system and can provide a lot of savings,” said Henchen. Power use will become smarter and more automated, with technology helping spread energy use throughout the day to work in tandem with a grid powered by variable wind and solar, rather than cause big surges in demand that require the burning of gas or coal. New tools for heating and cooling the home Another energy efficient move will be to properly insulate homes. In fact new homes could be pre-fabricated in factories and fitted on site to reduce gaps where heat can escape. Deep reductions in emissions will involve revamping the major appliances in the home, such as the water heater, furnace and air conditioning unit. As these items become older, they become wasteful and they will need to be replaced by more efficient appliances that run off clean electricity. Some of these replacements will be relatively innocuous, such as the installation of heat pumps, which will be in the basement or on the side of the house. Heat pumps work on principles similar to a refrigerator, shifting heat from outdoors indoors and vice versa. They can heat and cool your home and can also heat your water with an efficiency rate four times greater than a gas-powered version. The changes you’ll notice in everyday life Other changes will be more obvious in day-to-day life, such as replacing incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs, installing low-flow shower heads and phasing out gas stoves in favor of electric induction stovetops. Such a change may be unnerving to dedicated home cooks but proponents point to the swifter heat-up time, reduced indoor air pollution and negated risk of injuries to the hands of curious children . “People will get used to technology like induction cooktops. There are already top chefs out there giving out the message that they don’t have a worse performance than gas,” said Rohini Srivastava, a buildings expert at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The phase-out of gas will also remove the need for a carbon monoxide detector in the home, although in the western US, air purifiers may become a standard feature in an age of growing wildfire smoke. At what cost? All of this will cost money – about $70,000 for the average American household to decarbonize, according to Rewiring America. And broader, systemic changes will need to take place to make housing denser and centered around transit lines and walkable communities to reduce car use, as well as a concerted effort to make homes resilient to the storms and fires spurred by the climate crisis. Climate advocates are calling for a slate of government support to aid this transition – San Francisco is currently working out how to make the $5.9bn switch to electrify all its homes currently powered by gas – but stress that the public will need to view the changes as painless. “The only way we will be able to do this is if the home feels just as comfortable and user-friendly as it has always been” said Cunningham. “You need to be able to take hot showers, be cool in summer and warm in winter and not know the difference in terms of how that is all powered.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-12T07:13:55Z","webTitle":"UK plan to replace fossil gas with blue hydrogen ‘may backfire’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","fields":{"headline":"UK plan to replace fossil gas with blue hydrogen ‘may backfire’","bodyText":"The government’s plan to replace fossil gas with “blue” hydrogen to help meet its climate targets could backfire after US academics found that it may lead to more emissions than using gas. In some cases blue hydrogen, which is made from fossil gas, could be up to 20% worse for the climate than using gas in homes and heavy industry, owing to the emissions that escape when gas is extracted from the ground and split to produce hydrogen. The process leaves a byproduct of carbon dioxide and methane, which fossil fuel companies plan to trap using carbon capture technology. However, even the most advanced schemes cannot capture all the emissions, leaving some to enter the atmosphere and contribute to global heating. Professors from Cornell and Stanford universities calculated that these “fugitive” emissions from producing hydrogen could eclipse those associated with extracting and burning gas when multiplied by the amount of gas required to make an equivalent amount of energy from hydrogen. Robert Howarth, a Cornell University professor and co-author of the study, said the research was the first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal to lay bare the “significant lifecycle emissions intensity of blue hydrogen”. The paper, which will be published in Energy Science and Engineering, warned that blue hydrogen may be “a distraction” or “something that may delay needed action to truly decarbonise the global energy economy”. The researchers recommended a focus on green hydrogen, which is made using renewable electricity to extract hydrogen from water, leaving only oxygen as a byproduct. “This is a warning signal to governments that the only ‘clean’ hydrogen they should invest public funds in is truly net zero, green hydrogen made from wind and solar energy,” Howarth said. A spokesperson for the UK government said hydrogen would be “essential for meeting our legally binding commitment to eliminating the UK’s contribution to climate change by 2050” and promised further details in the government’s forthcoming hydrogen strategy, which is expected next month. “Independent reports, including that from the Climate Change Committee, show that a combination of blue and green hydrogen is consistent with reaching net zero but alongside the strategy, we will consult on a new UK standard for low-carbon hydrogen production to ensure the technologies we support make a real contribution to our goals,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-11T17:30:03Z","webTitle":"Energy commission dials back plan to charge households to send rooftop solar power to grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","fields":{"headline":"Energy commission dials back plan to charge households to send rooftop solar power to grid","bodyText":"A proposal for households with rooftop solar panels to be charged for exporting electricity into the power grid at certain times has been softened, with regulators guaranteeing a “free option” under which people will not face any cost. The Australian Energy Market Commission said its final decision on changes designed to prevent “traffic jams” of electricity at sunny times in the middle of the day, would also prevent network operators placing a blanket ban on customers sending energy to the grid. Under changes to be announced on Thursday, electricity network companies would have to offer solar customers an option under which they would not face a financial penalty, but would probably face a limit on how much electricity they can export. Other options would involve solar users paying an upfront cost in return for being paid a higher rate for energy exported when demand for grid electricity is higher. One of the goals of the paid option is to make it more attractive for people to invest in batteries, electric vehicles (EVs) and appliances that allow them to timeshift household energy use. The commission said proposed network offers for solar offers would be assessed by the Australian Energy Regulator, which would have to consider the “long-term consumer interest”. Existing solar customers would not move on to the new system before July 2025. The shift follows a pushback against a draft declaration in March that critics said could penalise people who had installed solar in good faith and give too much power to networks in proposing consumer charges. A final decision was delayed due to the extent of public feedback. In a statement released to media ahead of the final announcement, the commission said the changes would impose “tough new obligations” on network companies requiring them to make their businesses solar and battery friendly. It said it was part of a plan to have more solar households, cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep costs down. The commission’s chief executive, Benn Barr, said it had listened to feedback and tightened protections for consumers to ensure people would not have to pay to export solar if they chose not to. He said people could earn by sending electricity to the grid when it was needed, or save by using delay-start functions to set appliances such as dishwashers to run on solar energy in the middle of the day. The commission’s chair, Anna Collyer, said it would turn the “current one-way street delivering power to people’s homes into a two-way super-highway where energy flows in both directions”. “Power network companies will need to deliver services to support solar and they’ll be judged on their performance on how much solar exports they allow into the grid,” she said. “These new measures to drive smart solar are fundamental to enabling a modern electricity grid.” She said the changes reflected widespread concern from industry, consumers and environment groups that the grid would not be able to handle a forecast doubling of household solar power over the next decade. About 2.8m Australian households now have solar systems. At peak moments in the middle of the day, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. Advocacy group Solar Citizens has been sharply critical of the commission’s proposed change, describing it as a “sun tax”. It argued solar users should be rewarded for helping cut emissions, and that changing the rules after the fact was unfair. But the fairness principle was also invoked by those broadly supportive of the commission’s proposal. The change was a response to proposals from power distribution company SA Power Networks, the Total Environment Centre and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and St Vincent de Paul. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, has said the country needed a rapid transition to renewable energy, but increased network costs to deal with the influx of household solar should not be paid by people without panels, including the third of households who rent. She told Guardian Australia last month it was important that people with solar were given a choice over whether they paid to send electricity to the grid at busy times or could accept a limit on how much they exported. State governments raised concerns about the commission’s draft proposal to varying degrees. Victoria and Queensland indicated they did not support export charges. The commission estimated under a worst-case scenario solar owners choosing paid plans would still earn at least 90% of what they do now from their panels. It said it should lead to a power bill reduction for 80% of customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-08T17:30:27Z","webTitle":"Australia ‘lagging at the back of the pack’ of OECD countries on climate action, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australia ‘lagging at the back of the pack’ of OECD countries on climate action, analysis finds","bodyText":"Claims by the Morrison government that Australia has done more to cut greenhouse gas emissions than other countries have been challenged by an analysis that found it has gone backwards compared to similar countries over the past 15 years. Energy analyst Dr Hugh Saddler ranked the performance of 23 OECD countries and Russia on eight climate measures, including share of electricity from non-fossil fuels, per capita emissions from transport and overall emissions intensity of each economy. He found Australia was ranked 20th or worse in seven of the eight categories. In relative terms, it had not improved in any category since 2005 and had gone backwards compared to other developed countries in four. Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said his research – published by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – showed the country was “lagging at the back of the pack” among developed countries in transforming its economy. He contrasted it with Morrison’s claim, made ahead of a virtual climate summit hosted by the US in April, that Australia’s record in reducing emissions was better than many of the other major countries appearing at the event. “Despite the last decade of growth in solar and wind energy, fossil fuels still dominate Australia’s energy sector and its rate of electrification – that is, getting off coal, oil and gas for energy – is one of the worst in the OECD,” Saddler said. The emissions analysis precedes the release on Monday night of a landmark report by the world’s leading climate scientists that will assess the state of the global climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report is a comprehensive review of the world’s knowledge of the climate crisis and how rapidly human actions are altering the planet. Saddler said his research showed the government’s “so-called gas-fired economic recovery”, under which the Coalition has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to fossil fuel power and opening up new gas basins, was “absolutely counter to the needs of Australia’s energy system transition”. “Over the past 15 years, Australia has squandered its golden opportunity to decouple its energy sector from fossil fuels, unlike so many other OECD countries,” he said. “As a result Australians are left with high-polluting and inefficient power, heating, housing and transport. This also drives up our cost of living and drives down our energy productivity.” The government defends its performance on climate by arguing the fall in Australia’s emissions since 2005 – about 20%, according to the most recent national accounts – is better than many comparable counties. Morrison and other government MPs have repeatedly cited the figure when asked why Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target is only half that set by the US and European Union, and less than half that promised by Britain. They say Australia has a record of “over-achieving” on emissions targets. But Saddler’s research backs earlier analyses that suggest this claim is misleading. He found all of Australia’s emissions reductions since 2005 have been due to farming activities, mainly due to a large fall in the amount of “land-clearing”. In basic terms, the annual destruction of forests and other ecosystems for agriculture and timber collection decreased over the decade from 2007 to 2017 – it still happens, but at a slower rate. Saddler’s report said if this change in how land was used was excluded from national emissions accounts Australia’s emissions had increased by 7% since 2005. He said it was a key, and often overlooked, point when comparing Australia’s emissions were compared to other countries. “Large one-off reductions in land-clearing are in no way evidence of a trend towards the decarbonisation of the Australian economy,” the report said. “For the purposes of international comparison, it is important to note that most other developed countries have no capacity to benefit from large reductions in land-clearing for the simple reason that they cleared most of their land centuries ago.” Saddler excluded changes in land use by choosing indicators that measured changes in energy consumption and emissions. They included energy combustion emissions, energy consumption, energy productivity (the amount of economic output for each unit of energy consumed), non-fossil fuel share of electricity and transport emissions. Findings included: Australia had the second most emissions-intensive energy system after Poland, a big coal producer. It achieved the second smallest increase in energy productivity across the 15 years, ahead of only Portugal. This is despite federal and state energy ministers releasing a national energy productivity plan in 2015. It has significantly increased its share of wind and solar energy but other countries have moved faster – it slipped from 13th (in 2005) to 14th (in 2019) on a ranking of the share of electricity from new renewable energy generation. It was one of only three countries to have increased total energy combustion emissions. Prior to Covid-19, it had the third highest per capita transport emissions, behind the US and Canada. Both North American countries reduced per capita transport emissions faster between 2005 and 2019 than Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2021/jul/20/wild-weekend-rewilding-kids-camp-in-west-sussex","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-20T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Go rewild in the country: a weekend kids’ camp in Sussex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jul/20/wild-weekend-rewilding-kids-camp-in-west-sussex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2021/jul/20/wild-weekend-rewilding-kids-camp-in-west-sussex","fields":{"headline":"Go rewild in the country: a weekend kids’ camp in Sussex","bodyText":"It’s a warm Saturday afternoon in July and we’ve gathered to learn about tracking animals. Our teacher crouches before us, making marks in the sand to demonstrate how a paw or hoof print might be slightly turned out to indicate that the creature was looking over its shoulder in fear as it ran. My children are fascinated, learning how to spot clues to the speed, type and even sex of the animal, and join in excitedly when shown how to mimic the gait of different species: the galloping scamper of rodents, racing big cats and the slow lumber of a bear. There’s been no need to travel to the African savannah for such lessons, only a giant white yurt in a field in West Sussex, where every summer weekend, small-scale, family-friendly rewilding camps are taking place. A programme of nature and wellbeing workshops varies each week, but might include fire making, archery, plant identification, yoga and creative writing, with acoustic music at night. These Wild Weekends are run on the Chiddinglye estate near West Hoathly on a plateau in the High Weald, a rolling landscape of fields and ancient woodland between London’s unlovely southern sprawl and Brighton. Privately owned by the eco-minded Earl of Limerick, the estate comprises hundreds of acres including a working wheat, sheep and solar energy farm. Arriving on Friday night with my children, a friend and her son, we just had time to lug our stuff through the mud using trolleys helpfully waiting at the top of the parcel of fields and woodland, to build our nests and muster dinner, before bats began to whir and darkness fell. People drew their folding chairs around the communal fire to hear guitarist Magic Bird sing ditties about moons and gods into the eddying smoke. The next night’s music was livelier, as foot-stomping collective Folkadelix got everyone dancing, telling the kids they were part of the band as they gleefully rattled bells. By the time we’d finished washing up Saturday’s breakfast, our efficiently child-free tent neighbours had already completed morning yoga, a meditation session and qigong. We made our way across the dewy grass to the Foxes Den tent for “wild kids crafts”, which won out against a workshop about the secret language of birds (my preference) and bow making (vetoed on account of a £35pp surcharge). While the children rolled clay into the shape of animals and bowls, host Anu described how she lived with her three children in a horse-box van on the site, having adopted a nomadic lifestyle over a decade ago. Covid had made many more families feel ready to commit to a similar alternative lifestyle, she said, and for some this sort of event was an opportunity to explore a different, low-impact way of living. “It doesn’t have the hedonism of other sites here, you can just come to be in nature,” she said. Indeed the atmosphere was extremely chilled. There’s no alcohol for sale on the site itself – though you are free to bring some, and the estate is home to an excellent microbrewery, Missing Link, with a tap room and beer van in a field a short walk away. While campsites around the UK have added bars, DJ sets and activities this summer to tempt those who are usually festival-goers, these weekends appeal to the same market, and were created as a smaller, Covid-era alternative to a wellbeing festival Into The Wild, held on the same site, when it seemed big events wouldn’t be allowed to take place this year (the festival is now still running 27-30 August on a smaller scale than usual). Next, a brilliant falconry display. Falconer Ryan told funny tales while enticing his impressive owls, hawks and falcons to return from the site’s towering totem pole, thrilling the kids by seating them in line with their eyes closed and feel the rush of air as Arnie the Bengal eagle owl flew centimetres above their heads. The audience was more reluctant to get near Alfie, a Canadian horned owl, after hearing he’d once bitten the end of Ryan’s thumbnail off and stuck his talon right through, landing Ryan in hospital for two days with sepsis. We skipped the two-hour foraging class to take advantage of one of the best assets here – a magical glamping site, the Enchanted Glade, which occupies another part of the Chiddinglye estate. Though it’s a separate venture, Wild Weekenders can pay to stay in tipis here or, like us, for sessions at the wild spa. Descending into a mystical-feeling gully of redwoods and huge boulders, we soaked in the wood-burning hot tub, gazing at the forest, took icy outdoor showers and warmed our bones in the wood-fired sauna. I’d recommend going even without the events, and plan to return for my birthday, it’s that special. Partly it’s the otherworldly landscape that makes it so – deep wooded valleys with sandstone outcrops through which trails weave to caverns, boulders, an iron age site and mossy dells overhung with jungly ferns. Ironically, it was while exploring a section that the Earl rightly calls “the land that time forgot” that we felt most rewilded. Nature was getting into the children, capturing their focus. Unprompted, they started monitoring bug life, collecting sticks, roaming further on their own. Like anything with saintly intentions, it’s easy to point out a few inconsistencies and niggles – the fact the Badger’s Den snack bar sells Haribo and pot noodles, that evening entertainment started a bit late for kids at 8pm, some sessions were cancelled, and while delicious, the Red Moon stall’s food (aubergine curry and dal) wasn’t very child-friendly. And it was a shame there were no talks about founder Huw Williams’ project, Wilderlands, which aims to rewild an area of temperate rainforest in Scotland and the South Downs, which these events help raise money for. But this is a new concept finding its feet in a difficult year. As a whole, it was a lovely, slow-paced immersion in a beautiful environment, with enough intelligent programming to tickle the neurons in a wholesome way. We looked back on a peaceful, rewarding weekend, and only had to consider the state of the kids: relaxed, caked in mud, joy rekindled, to appreciate what it’s all about. • The trip was provided by Wild Weekends, which run until 20 September. Weekend tickets from £150 for adults, £60 kids aged 4-16, under-3s free. Saturday ticket with camping £95 for adults, £55 kids (without camping it’s £65/£40). Some weekends are adults only.

Emissions will rise again this year and next year, after a fall last year, and 2023 is now on track to see the highest levels of carbon dioxide output in human history, equalling or surpassing the record set in 2018, according to forecasts released by the International Energy Agency on Tuesday. Such a rise would put the goals of the Paris climate agreement all but out of reach, as scientists have warned that emissions must halve this decade if the world is to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the effects of climate breakdown will ravage swathes of the globe. The reason for the sharp rise is that governments have failed to invest in green energy as they have sought to rebuild their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, said: “Of more than $16tn [£11.7tn, being spent on recovery from Covid-19] only 2% is going to clean energy investments. This is by far not enough. What we will see is that 2023 will reach an all-time record high [in emissions]. This is very worrying.” Significant to the forecast emissions rise is the pattern of pandemic recovery in emerging economies. Big wealthy economies, such as the US, EU member states, Japan and South Korea, have been investing in renewable energy and are on track to reduce their emissions. But countries such as India, Indonesia, Latin American countries and other emerging economies are falling behind in clean energy investments. About 90% of the forecast growth in emissions will come from the developing world, so helping such countries invest in green energy is of global importance, said Birol. “The most critical faultline [in attempts to tackle the climate crisis] is providing clean energy investments in emerging countries.” He said developing countries needed financial help to make the leap. “At the global scale, there is no lack of capital [available for investment in green energy] but that capital does not look at these projects in emerging economies,” he said. “There is a perception that the risk is higher.” He called on institutions such as the International Monetary Fund to step up their help to direct funds towards clean energy projects. Wind and solar energy are now cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world, while investments in energy efficiency also yield strong returns, and electric vehicle technology is becoming more affordable. Rich countries must also fulfil their promises to ensure at least $100bn a year in climate finance flows to developing countries, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather, Birol said. The pledge of $100bn a year has been a serious sticking point in the run-up to the Cop26 talks. “This $100bn should be a floor, not a ceiling,” he added. Cutting emissions in developing countries is cheaper than doing so in the industrialised world, giving rich countries an added impetus to extend assistance. “Advanced economies have both an economic rationale and a moral obligation to supply climate finance to the emerging world,” he said. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has also been investing in renewable energy but has strong and continuing investments in coal and high-CO2 infrastructure. Birol said there were encouraging signs, however, that coal investment was reducing. “There is good news on coal. We do not see so much investment in coal.” Birol will present his findings to the climate and energy ministers of the G20 nations, meeting later this week in Italy. He said it was vital that the G20, and all countries meeting for the crunch UN Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow should put in place a real “green recovery” from the pandemic. “We need to have as a purpose how to mobilise investment in clean energy,” he said. “We need this at Cop26 – there is no way out.” CO2 emissions have already rebounded strongly after their sudden plunge last spring, when governments around the world sent their countries into successive lockdowns. They are set to jump this year by the second highest amount on record, according to the IEA, the gold standard for emissions predictions. There had been hopes that this bounceback would be temporary, because the “brown economy” – dependent on high fossil fuel use – came roaring back after the Covid-19 recessions in many countries, while the green economy is still in development. Last week, Vivid Economics found that only about a tenth, or about $1.8tn, of all spending on recovery measures would have a beneficial impact on the climate and environment, while about twice that amount would have an environmentally harmful impact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-16T20:00:41Z","webTitle":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","bodyText":"Michael Streatfeild was an early solar adopter. About a decade ago he withdrew $15,000 from his mortgage to install a 3.6kW system of panels on a north-east facing section of his roof in western Sydney. Three years ago, in a bid to wipe out his reliance on coal-fired grid electricity, he added a 4kW system and positioned it to catch sun later in the day, when it comes from the north-west. The sharp fall in the cost of solar in recent years meant the second system, though bigger than the first, cost just $5,000, a third of what he paid in 2011. Together, the two systems have all but wiped out his electricity bills – his last two brought refunds of about $100. Streatfeild is part of a rapidly expanding Australian story. About 2.8m households have solar systems, with another 3m expected to join them over the next decade. The flood of solar energy those houses create in the middle of the day when the sun is high is rapidly and dramatically transforming the electricity grid. At peak moments, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is now from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. In his first speech this week, the new head of the energy market operator, Daniel Westerman, set a target of the entire grid being able to run entirely on renewable energy, at least for brief moments, by 2025. According to regulators and some analysts, this solar influx, while welcome, is also causing potential problems by creating “traffic jams” in a system that was largely designed to send energy from a few large generators to homes and businesses. This prompted the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in March to propose a change that could give network providers the power to charge people who export electricity into the grid at times when it is not needed. It argued the change was necessary to make room for more household solar systems and batteries to be connected to the grid, and to make the system fairer for all users. The commission, which makes rules for the electricity system, suggested two-way pricing that better rewarded solar and battery owners who send power to the grid at peak times – the early evening, for example. It also recommended new incentives that would give customers more reason to buy batteries or electric vehicles, or set up their homes to consume the power they generate at busy times. The proposal has proved divisive, pitting against each other those who want to see a rapid expansion of solar but who have different views about what is required to get there. From Streatfeild’s perspective, the potential new impost is unreasonable, but not surprising. A former police officer and member of the advocacy group Solar Citizens, he says he was motivated to get panels by the climate stance of the then opposition leader Tony Abbott and thoughts about the future his grandchildren faced. “I wanted to be able to say to them, ‘I didn’t fuck this Earth up for you, I did the best I could’,” Streatfeild says. He believes big electricity generators and networks have a history of profiteering and should bear any transformation costs, while solar consumers should be rewarded for bringing down the wholesale electricity price by undercutting ageing – and increasingly unviable – coal-fired power plants. “It’s really bad management by the network operators, in my opinion,” Streatfeild says. “They should have foreseen the need for all this. They seem to just want to screw us again.” Solar Citizens has a similar position. It has labelled the AEMC’s proposal a “sun tax”, and says solar homes and businesses should be rewarded for the benefits they provide, not penalised. “People have invested in solar in good faith,” says Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ national director. “Any time that people have invested in something and the rules change it is breaching a fairness principle.” But arguments over fairness and solar power quickly become complicated – the same principle is invoked by supporters of the AEMC proposal. They say the change is needed in part to ensure a more equitable system for poor households that cannot afford solar panels and therefore bear a greater share of network charges. The AEMC’s draft rule followed proposals from an unlikely collection of groups, including the power distribution company SA Power Networks and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the St Vincent de Paul Society. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, says the country needs a rapid transition to renewable electricity, but the question is who pays for it. Roughly a third of households are renting, so they can’t install solar panels and rely more heavily on – and pay more for – the poles and wires provided by electricity networks than those with solar. Caught says people with solar panels did not create the problem regulators are trying to address, but she believes the proposed rule change would benefit both grid security and consumers. “At the moment, the people who can least afford it are carrying more of the network costs,” she says. She says it is important the change empowers consumers with solar by giving them, and not network operators, the choice over whether they pay to export electricity at busy times or just accept a limit on how much they can send to the grid. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne Climate and Energy College, also argues cutting emissions must be prioritised, but socially just. He cites research by the Grattan Institute in 2015 that suggests the effective subsidy paid by non-solar households to those with solar would be $3.6bn out to 2030. McConnell says at the heart of the debate is a question of whether household solar owners have a right to earn revenue by exporting to the grid, given they save money by using their self-generated solar energy at home, and whether that right comes with a responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure changes needed to ensure it is possible. Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, strongly disagrees. He argues the change proposed by the AEMC is based on a fallacy as the poorest households share the financial benefits of increased solar uptake at a level that far outweighs the additional network costs they face. He also suggests there is no evidence that more solar in the grid in the middle of the day is a problem that could not be addressed at low cost. “There simply isn’t good evidence of a problem to which export charging is a solution,” Mountain says. State governments have raised concerns about the change to varying degrees. Both Victoria and Queensland have indicated they do not support export charges. Some states have suggested grandfathering any cost so it does not affect people who already have panels. Other submissions to the AEMC argue to be effective the change must ensure solar owners who do what it wants – export their electricity when it is most needed – are well rewarded. They say it needs to become attractive to buy a household battery, or an EV that can both draw and export power to the grid. Neither technology has received the level of government support offered for rooftop panels when they were at similar levels of uptake a decade ago. Coincidentally or otherwise, the AEMC this week released a separate draft plan it says will make it easier for small battery owners to send electricity to the grid and earn revenue. The commission argues the average solar household with a system of between 4kW and 6kW will still do well after its proposed rule change. It estimates they will save about $900 a year on power bills – about $70 less than currently – and that households without solar would have their bills reduced as they would no longer have to pay for solar export services they do not use. It says alternatives to introducing an export cost, such as blocking people’s solar exports when the grid is under strain, or building more poles and wires to allow greater solar traffic, would be more expensive for consumers. The former would also have the effect of reducing the amount of renewable energy coming into the grid. The commission’s chief executive and chair, Benn Barr and Anna Collyer, emphasise that the rule change would not mandate an export charge, but allow networks to put forward proposals. The change would start in 2025. Barr says all governments support what he describes as a profound shift – a recognition for the first time that electricity networks need to take power from houses, not just get it to them. “What it means is those businesses now have an incentive and an obligation to upgrade the grid to get more solar, and be ready for when electric vehicles come,” Barr says. “It has kind of got lost a bit, but it will really change the ways those businesses do work, and benefit consumers across Australia.” A final decision on the rule change was initially due earlier this month but is now expected on 12 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-13T02:59:09Z","webTitle":"Plan to build world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Western Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","fields":{"headline":"Plan to build world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Western Australia","bodyText":"An international consortium wants to build what would be the world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Australia’s south-west to convert wind and solar power into green fuels like hydrogen. The group of energy companies announced the proposal over a 15,000 sq km area that could have a 50 gigawatt capacity and cost $100bn. An area bigger than the size of greater Sydney has been identified in the south-east of Western Australia with “consistently high levels of wind and solar energy”. Guardian Australia understands the Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) could cost about $100bn. The project’s 50GW capacity compares to the 54GW of generation capacity of all the coal, gas and renewables plants currently in the national energy market, which includes all states except WA and the Northern Territory. Australia’s biggest coal plant is just 2.9GW. InterContinental Energy, CWP Global and Mirning Green Energy Limited announced plans for the mega project on Tuesday, saying it wants to build the scheme in three phases to produce up to 3.5m tonnes of green hydrogen or 20m tonnes of green ammonia each year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia understands the consortium is looking to produce the first fuels from the project by 2030, and will look to construct an offshore facility to transfer fuels onto ships. The consortium – which includes an Indigenous-owned energy company – said it wanted to tap into a global market for green hydrogen it expects will be worth US$50tn by 2050. About 30GW of the hub would focus on wind, with the rest coming from solar power. Hydrogen and ammonia produced at the hub would be destined for use in power stations, shipping, heavy industry and aviation. The hub would be larger than a 45GW renewables project announced by German company Svevind Energy and planned for Kazakhstan, reported to be the world’s biggest renewables project proposed so far. Last month, Australia’s environment minister Sussan Ley rejected a plan for a 26GW hub in the north of WA for “clearly unacceptable” impacts on threatened migratory species and internationally recognised wetlands. In a statement, Trevor Naley, chairman of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation and a board member on the consortium, said: “As First Nations land owners, the Mirning people are excited to hold such an integral and defining stake in this historical partnership with WGEH. This partnership, through robust governance and a seat at the table for Mirning people, will provide opportunities never before available to Indigenous corporations.” Brendan Hammond, chairman of WGEH said the proposal was “historic on two fronts” for its scale and its partnership with traditional owners. “It is an honour and a privilege to be involved in this groundbreaking project,” he said. WA’s hydrogen minister Alannah MacTiernan told the West Australian the proposal was “truly massive” and said the state was positioned to be a major contributor to global decarbonisation. The newspaper said the consortium had secured a licence from WA’s McGowan government to complete site surveys and research to pursue a business case for the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jul/08/bp-global-wind-and-solar-power-capacity-grew-at-record-rate-in-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-08T14:05:18Z","webTitle":"Global wind and solar power capacity grew at record rate in 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/08/bp-global-wind-and-solar-power-capacity-grew-at-record-rate-in-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jul/08/bp-global-wind-and-solar-power-capacity-grew-at-record-rate-in-2020","fields":{"headline":"Global wind and solar power capacity grew at record rate in 2020","bodyText":"The world’s wind and solar energy capacity grew at a record rate last year while the oil industry recorded its steepest slump in demand since the second world war, according to BP. The impact of coronavirus lockdowns on the energy industry led carbon emissions to plummet by 6% on the year before, the sharpest decline since 1945, according to BP’s annual review of the energy sector. But the report says the impact of Covid on carbon emissions needs to be replicated every year for the next three decades if governments hope to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “Yes, they were the biggest falls seen for 75 years,” said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. “But they occurred against the backdrop of a global pandemic and the largest economic recession in postwar history. The challenge is to reduce emissions without causing massive disruption and damage to everyday lives and livelihoods.” The warning echoes a report from the International Energy Agency last month which predicted that the world’s demand for oil would bounce back by 5.4m barrels a day this year, one of the fastest climbs on record, and rebound to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. BP’s annual energy review, published every year since 1952, is considered influential in the energy industry and helps to inform the company’s strategic decisions. Last year BP set out a plan to cut its oil production and increase its renewable energy generation within the next decade, en route to becoming a net zero energy company by 2050. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, said: “Yes, the world needs more low-carbon companies. But maybe more than anything it also needs existing energy companies to decarbonise, and in so doing use their scale and expertise to help bring about the deep and complex rewiring and replumbing of the global energy system that the world wants and needs to see over the next 30 years.” BP’s latest energy review found that the world’s total energy consumption fell by 4.5% in 2020, driven mainly by a 9.7% slump in demand for crude, used to make transport fuels, or just over 9m barrels of oil a day. Dale said the collapse in demand was “far bigger than anything seen in history and far bigger than the falls” in other energy sources. Meanwhile the “relentless expansion of renewable energy” meant electricity generated by wind, solar and hydroelectricity plants was “relatively unscathed”, Dale said. The report found that global wind and solar power capacity grew by 238GW in 2020, more than five times greater than the UK’s total renewable energy capacity. The increase was mainly driven by China, which accounted for roughly half of the global increase in wind and solar energy production capacity, but even controlling for that 2020 was a record year for building wind and solar farms. Dale said the trend away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy last year was “exactly what the world needs to see as it transitions to net zero”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-07T23:01:45Z","webTitle":"UK must match rhetoric with action on China’s treatment of Uyghurs, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"UK must match rhetoric with action on China’s treatment of Uyghurs, say MPs","bodyText":"Britain must act to stop China’s atrocities against Uyghur Muslims by banning the import of Chinese cotton and solar panels from Xinjiang province, as well as by announcing that no government officials will attend the Winter Olympics in Beijing, a report by MPs says. The chair of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said that without action the UK would be allowing China “to nest the dragon deeper and deeper into British life”. The committee’s report says the government’s often tough rhetoric over “the industrial-scale forced labour schemes in Xinjiang” is not matched by effective action. The MPs accuse ministers of setting lax requirements on companies to remove forced labour from their supply chains, failing to sanction the Chinese official most responsible for mass atrocities, and failing after six months to publish “an urgent review” of UK trade controls from Xinjiang. They also urge ministers to join the UK parliament in describing what is happening as genocide, saying the tactics of naming and shaming has been shown to be more effective than closed-door diplomacy. A special fast-track asylum system for Uyghurs is also proposed. The all-party report also calls for technology firms underpinning what is described as Xinjiang’s police state to be banned from the UK. The report is certain to provoke an angry reaction from the Chinese government, but one committee member, Alicia Kearns, said MPs could not shy away from making criticisms. Kearns said: “It’s time for big boy politics. You cannot work with any partner on a best friend basis. We are the mother of all parliaments and if we are not willing to speak up for those that others seek to silence, then what parliament is going to do it?” The report says: “The Chinese government is responsible for the mass detention of more than a million Uyghurs, for forcing them into industrial-scale forced labour programmes, and for attempting to wipe out Uyghur and Islamic culture in the region through forced sterilisation of women, destruction of cultural sites, and separation of children from families. “The mass incarcerations and connected factories and farms mean it should be assumed that any product originating from Xinjiang is the product of forced labour. While much focus has been placed on the textile and apparel sector, other areas such as solar energy, agriculture and electronics also bear a substantial risk of using forced labour.” It says as many as 570,000 people are forced to pick cotton, often paid little to nothing. As a remedy it proposes that “until there can be definitive proof that products are not tainted by forced labour, UK companies and consumers should not be purchasing them”. It also calls for a government import ban on cotton and other products sourced to forced labour, something Tugendhat said was in compliance with WTO rules. More than 80% of China’s cotton comes from Xinjiang, and China provides a quarter of the world’s cotton products. Similarly, 40% of UK solar panels have Xinjiang-sourced materials. The report also proposes that “the British Olympic Association does not participate in the opening or closing Beijing 2022 ceremonies, beyond one representative carrying the union flag. It should abstain from sending government officials to any ceremonies or functions, strongly discourage UK businesses from sponsoring or advertising at the Olympics, encourage fans and tourists to stay away, and discourage athletes from supporting or accepting the Chinese government’s propaganda efforts.” The report calls for a ban on the use in Britain of surveillance equipment supplied by the Chinese firm Hikvision, saying the firm operates in Xinjiang and so has helped turn the province into “a modern police state where advanced technology is deployed to support an unprecedented level of surveillance, invasion of privacy and repression”. At the same time the report praises the government’s diplomatic efforts to raise the issue internationally, and accuses China of using its belt and road initiative as a means of putting pressure on many Islamic countries not to speak out against the atrocities in Xinjiang. Tugendhat, who has already been personally subject to Chinese government sanctions, said there was a growing need to adopt a tough approach. “We are seeing a growing nationalism in China and we need to be cautious that what we are not doing is being seen to be feeding the crocodile and hoping to be eaten last.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The evidence of the scale and the severity of the human rights violations being perpetrated in Xinjiang against the Uyghur Muslims is far-reaching, and paints a truly harrowing picture. “The UK government has led international efforts to hold China to account for its human rights violations in Xinjiang at the UN. We will carefully consider the findings of this report.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/jun/28/markets-subdued-covid-19-restrictions-global-recovery-ftse-pound-dow-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-28T17:25:38Z","webTitle":"Travel shares hit by summer ‘washout’ fears from tighter restrictions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/28/markets-subdued-covid-19-restrictions-global-recovery-ftse-pound-dow-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/jun/28/markets-subdued-covid-19-restrictions-global-recovery-ftse-pound-dow-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Travel shares hit by summer ‘washout’ fears from tighter restrictions – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up. Travel stocks have started the week with chunky falls, on concerns that the summer holiday season will be a washout as tighter restrictions are introduced by some European countries. UK tourists will need to show they are fully vaccinated when visiting Portugal, Malta, and Spain’s Mallorca, Ibiza and neighbouring islands. Both British Airways parent company IAG (-5.9%) and budget airline easyJet (-5.8%) fell sharply, as analysts warned that the travel industry’s hopes of a good summer were fading. This pulled Europe’s stock markets lower, with the FTSE 100 ended down 0.9% or 63 points lower at 7072. Global markets were also overshadowed by rising Covid-19 infections in the Asia-Pacific region, and in South Africa, which have forced governments to introduce new restrictions. Oil has also dropped back from its highest levels since October 2018, with Brent crude now down 1.8% at $74.80 per barrel. In New York, the tech-focused Nasdaq hit a fresh record high. But the Dow fell, with Boeing losing 3% after regulators raised fresh concerns over its upcoming 777X jet, which mean it’s unlikely to be certified before 2023. Here are today’s main stories: Goodnight. GW Pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca finished as the FTSE 100’s top riser, up almost 2%. AstraZeneca reported this morning that its Forxiga drug has been approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Separately, an Oxford University study has found that a ‘mix-and-match’ approach to Covid-19 vaccines can boost the immune response. If found that receiving a shot of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine four weeks after an AstraZeneca dose produces a strong immune response - higher than giving another dose of AstraZeneca. The reverse combination also produced high concentrations of antibodies, meaning that all possible vaccination schedules could be used. Although as the UK has a “stable supply position” there is no reason to change vaccine schedules at this moment in time, says Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam. Reuters has more details:... The data provides support for the decision of some European countries that have started offering alternatives to AstraZeneca as a second shot after the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots. Matthew Snape, the Oxford professor behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own. “It’s certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules,” he told reporters. “But I think your default has to stay, unless there’s a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work,” he added referring to the same-shot vaccine schedules assessed in clinical trials. Shares in European airlines also fell today, with Air France down 4%, Lufthansa losing 3.6% and Ryanair dropping 3%. That comes alongside the falls in London where IAG fell 5.9%, EasyJet lost 5.8% and TUI shed 5.3%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says it was “another difficult day” for the travel and leisure sector.... with some European countries introducing new restrictions on UK arrivals, and the worrying rise in cases in Asia covered early this morning. Having seen falls at the end of last week over disappointment over the limited government relaxation of travel restrictions, which saw the addition of Malta, Madeira and the Balearics to the green list. Airlines were also unhappy that the government wasn’t bolder in promising that it would look at dropping quarantine rules for fully vaccinated UK residents returning home from amber list countries. While airlines and travel companies expressed disappointment over last week’s announcement criticising the government for its cautious approach, the reality is whatever countries the government puts on its green list now matters less than the restrictions being faced by UK passengers when they leave the UK for their destination country. Airlines can huff and puff all they like, the reality is the UK government could have put a much higher number on its green list, but unless that list is reciprocated then passengers are still going to face pretty significant obstacles to travel, and sadly no amount of complaining about it will change that fact. We’ve heard this morning that German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to ban all UK travellers from coming into the EU due to rising Delta variant cases. While this isn’t a view that is shared across Europe, Spain has announced that they want to see a proof of vaccination, or a negative covid test for those who want to go to the islands on the UK’s green list. Portugal is also insisting on certain safeguards, but it’s not just a Europe problem as the Delta variant starts to spread across Asia. In Australia, the Sydney region has implemented a full two-week lockdown, due to rising cases of Delta. With so few of the population vaccinated it is highly probable this will get extended and unlikely that the borders will reopen quickly. Hong Kong also announced that it would also ban all UK travellers from Thursday this week in a bid to keep the Delta variant out. This is ultimately where the longer-term problem lies for airlines in Europe, and it appears that markets are slowly waking up to this, with British Airways owner IAG shares falling to four-month lows, as the prospect of a return to its profitable Asia routes diminishes further. Air France-KLM shares are at their lowest levels this year while Lufthansa shares are at five-month lows. UK baker Greggs had a good day, with shares closing 2.9% higher after it reported that its sales recovery was continuing. Greggs told the City this morning that like-for-like sales at its company-managed shops were still between 1% and 3% ahead of 2019’s levels, despite tougher competition from cafes and restaurants who have been allowed to host customers indoors again since mid-May. The steak bake, sausage roll, sandwich and drinks company explains: This level of sustained sales recovery is stronger than we had anticipated and, if it were to continue, would have a materially positive impact on the expected financial result for the year. All Europe’s main stock indices finished the day lower, pulling the Stoxx 600 down by 0.6%. Germany’s DAX dipped by 0.35%, while France’s CAC lost nearly 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.1%. Spain’s IBEX tumbled almost 2%, as travel and leisure stocks were hit by concerns over travel restrictions and Covid-19 cases. Holiday resort operator Melia Hotels dropped 6.4%, airport operator Aena fell 4.1%, and swimming pool firm Fluidra finished 4% lower. After a subdued session, Britain’s FTSE 100 index has closed down 63 points at 7073 points, down 0.9%. Burberry were the top faller on the blue-chip index, slumping by 8.67% or 195p to £20.55, as investors expressed their disappointment about the surprise departure of boss Marco Gobbetti by the end of the year. Travel stocks also tumbled, after Spain, Portugal and Malta all tightened entry requirements for UK tourists, in a new blow to the sector. British Airways parent group IAG finished down 5.9% at 176p, its lowest level since March. Rolls-Royce, whose jet servicing business is dependent on airline flying hours, fell 5.6%, hitting their lowest level since mid-May. Commercial property firm British Land, which has suffered from the move to home-working in the pandemic, fell almost 4%, while Royal Dutch Shell shed 3.6% following the drop in the oil price today. InterContinental Hotels Group dropped by 3%, as did Premier Inns owner Whitbread. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused, dropped by 0.5%, with oil and gas producer Cairn Energy (-6%) leading the fallers. Budget airlines easyJet (-5.8%) and Wizz Air (-5.4%) were also hit by worries that the summer vacation season faced a washout, along with package holiday firm TUI (-5.3%). SSP, which owns the Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza chains, fell almost 5%, as traders anticipated fewer customers at travel hubs. Trainline, which sells tickets for travel in the UK and across Europe, lost almost 4%. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says summer holiday hopes are fading. Summer 2021 was supposed to bring salvation for the UK travel sector as lockdowns were lifted and arms were jabbed. Instead it has brought more confusion and a dawning realisation that a big money booking boost isn’t on the cards. “Shares in airlines, hotel businesses and travel companies have taken a battering today as investors rush to price in another twist in this long-running saga. Despite a number of popular tourist spots now being on offer to British holiday makers thanks to the government’s updated green list, it is precarious and it won’t mean a great deal if Germany gets its way and UK tourists are banned entry to the whole EU because of a concern over the Delta variant. “Even if that doesn’t materialise, holiday makers will have to read the small print of their booking after country after green lit country seems to be lining up change requirements. Malta, Spain and now Portugal are changing the goal posts, worried that pennies won’t be the only thing Britons will bring with them. “Though travel companies have reported a surge in bookings there have also been many stories of would-be-tourists hedging their bets and it’s likely many of those will decide to err on the side of caution and plump for their British booking. There are too many variables, too few certainties. No parent wants to get stranded at an airport with disappointed children or to spend their full holiday stuck in one hotel room. She also warns that the winding back of the UK’s furlough scheme from July will put more pressure on travel firms, if trading doesn’t pick up. “With changes to the furlough scheme just days away there will be nervousness within the sector. How far can airlines and travel companies stretch their meagre incomes, how long can they juggle costs, how much extra pressure will the new wage bill add? There are no easy answers and every day seems to bring more questions.” South African hospitality, grocery retail and gym stocks sank on Monday alongside the rand currency after the government tightened COVID-19 restrictions following the surge in Covid-19 cases. Reuters has the details: The travel and leisure index tumbled 7.53% to a one-month low and recorded its biggest daily decline in just over a year, with City Lodge, Tsogo Sun Gaming, Tsogo Sun Hotels and Sun International down between 6.70% and 9.83%. “Sentiment is very low on these businesses. People get fearful when news flow is bad as it is at the moment,” said Varshan Maharaj, Portfolio Manager at Allan Gray. Investment firm Brait SE BATJ.J, which holds just under 80% of Virgin Active gyms, fell 6.10%, while wines, spirits and cider producer Distell DGHJ.J slipped 0.69%. More here: South African hospitality stocks sink as COVID-19 restrictions tightened Back in the US, Texas factory activity expanded at a faster pace in June, according to business executives surveyed by the Dallas Federal Reserve. The Dallas Fed’s production index, which tracks manufacturing in the state, has risen by 14 points to 29.4 this month, a reading indicative of strong output growth. Other measures of manufacturing activity also pointed to accelerated growth this month. Measures of new orders, capacity utilization, shipments and business conditions all rose, as did forecasts for future manufacturing activity. However, the general business activity index dipped a little and bosses were a little more uncertain about the outlook. Labor market measures showed there was robust growth in employment and work hours, while price and wage pressures accelerated further in June. In a now familiar tale, both the raw materials prices index and the finished good price index hit record levels - as firms tried to handle the recent surge in costs. Texas firms also reported a flurry of issues with supply-chain disruptions and difficulties in hiring or recalling workers, as Sam Ro of Axios tweets: The number of new solar farms planned for the east of England has more than doubled in recent months as farmers decide to swap crops for clean energy. New solar farm applications for sites across Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Essex in the last five months have climbed to 840 megawatts, or the same as 2m household solar panels. The solar boom is expected to yield more than double the solar energy capacity that came forward for the east of England in the same months last year, and would be enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes with clean energy. More here: The departure of Marco Gobbetti as chief executive of Burberry raises the key question of whether Riccardo Tisci, whom Gobbetti appointed creative director soon after he joined, will remain at the luxury fashion brand, my colleague Jess Cartner-Morley writes: A desire to be closer to his family in Italy was given as the reason behind Gobbetti’s decision to quit Burberry, and Tisci too is thought to have found it difficult to be away from family in Italy for prolonged periods during the pandemic. The designer was a fashion student in London in his teens and has a deep affection for British culture and subculture, but the pull of his homeland remains strong. Italy has many deep-pocketed luxury brands and a shortage of exciting design talent, so opportunities are likely to present themselves. While Gobbetti focused on raising price points and elevating Burberry’s luxury status, Tisci worked on keeping Burberry relevant – a huge challenge over the past year, as the pandemic has put the fashion industry on the back foot. The charity partnership with the footballer Marcus Rashford, who starred in a recent advertising campaign, was a symbol of how Burberry successfully positioned itself at the progressive leading edge of culture. More here: The oil price has dropped back today, after hitting its highest levels in over two and a half years. Brent crude is down 1% at $75.24 per barrel, having briefly hit $76.60 in early trading - the highest since October 2018. That’s pulled down shares in BP (-3%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-3.1%) this afternoon. The Opec+ group are due to meet this week to discuss production levels beyond July, having gradually reduced their output cuts in recent months as demand has picked up. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says oil producers may be cautious about increasing production significantly, given the rise of the delta variant and uncertainty over whether sanctions on Iran will be lifted soon. Crude oil trades steady near the highest since 2018 with market participants expecting OPEC+ will keep supplies tight enough to support current levels. The group meets on Thursday to decide production levels from August and beyond, and the market is currently looking for an increase of 500,000 barrels per day which is less than the increases seen during the past three months. With virus uncertainties due to the highly contagious delta strain and questions about an Iran nuclear deal hanging over the market, the group may opt for caution, hence the current price strength. Back in London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped further into the red. It’s now down 55 points, or 0.75%, at 7081 points in afternoon trading. Travel stocks are still among the fallers (along with Burberry, now down 8% after CEO Marco Gobbetti decided to leave to run Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo). Aerospace manufacturer Boeing are the top faller on the Dow Jones industrial average, down over 3% in early trading. Reuters reported yesterday that the US Federal Aviation Administration had told Boeing that its planned 777X jet is not yet ready for a significant certification step. This means the FAA will “realistically” not certify the airplane until mid-to late 2023, they say. The 777X is a widebody plane, which Boeing says will be the world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. But regulators have concerns, particularly in light of the software flaws with the 737 MAX, which was grounded after two fatal crashes. The Seattle Times explains: In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023. That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned. The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.

Technology stocks are leading the risers on Wall Street, where the broader S&amp;P 500 index also nudged a new peak, before dipping back. But the Dow, which contains more stocks that benefit from the reopening of economies, is lower, with banks, energy firms and industrial companies lower. Dow: down 159 points or 0.45% at 34,274 points S&amp;P 500: down two points or 0.067% at 4,278 points Nasdaq composite: up 99 points or 0.7% at 14,459 points Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to Allianz, has told CNBC that investors are feeling comfortable about the global growth story, and confident that inflation will be transitory, and that central bankers will remain very supportive. As long as these three themes are reinforced, we still continue to see this positive momentum in the markets, El-Erian told CNBC’s Squawk Box show. But he also pointed out that there are some worrisome signs, due to the Delta variant - pointing to the Sydney lockdown, Israel re-imposing its mask mandate indoors, and the UK’s launch of pop-up vaccination centres as it battles the pandemic. El-Erian adds: “The good news is that vaccination has significantly weakened the link to hospitalizations and deaths. That’s why the economic implications of the Delta variant are not as worrisome as we’ve had in the past. However, if you’re not vaccinated, then you’re facing higher risk because of delta.” UK shopper numbers dipped by 0.2% last week, as the less-than-summery weather weighed on retailers. Research group Springboard reports that footfall in retail parks dropped by 2% in the week beginning Sunday 20th June, whilst in high streets and shopping centres it rose by +0.2% and +0.6%. That follows a 3.1% drop in footfall in the previous week (to 19th June), when rain hit the UK and kept consumers off the streets. Overall, retail footfall is still over 25% lower than in 2019, before the pandemic, with high street visits down 32% but retail parks just 5% quieter. With fewer tourists, and many commuters still at home, it’s no surprise that Central London is worst hit - with footfall down over 53% compared with two years ago, worse than market towns (-25.5%) and coastal towns (-28.2%). Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, says “variable weather” meant there was no pick-up in overall shop visits last week (which will disappoint retailers, given the lost trading during the lockdown). On the plus side, it seems that the appeal of larger city centres over smaller high streets rebounded last week, following shifts the other way in the previous two weeks. The lack of uplift in footfall on a week on week basis means that the gap from 2019 widened for the third consecutive week, although footfall remained noticeably higher than in the same week in 2020 which was the second week of trading following the lifting of Lockdown 1.” Britain’s small businesses are calling on the government for more Covid-19 support, before a ‘flashpoint’ hits companies on Thursday. The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that financial support packages will diminish on July 1, when business rates exemptions for retailers and hospitality firms and VAT payment deferrals end. The furlough scheme also becomes less generous, with firms having to pay 10% of wages of staff temporarily sidelined [currently the government is paying the full 80%]. With the end of lockdown extended beyond 21st June, the FSB says small firms need more help to bridge the gap until they can fully reopen. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry explains: “Last year the Government told us that it would do “whatever it takes” to help the 5.9 million sole traders and small businesses on which our recovery will depend. “The Treasury committed to evolving support measures to ensure they were adequate in the face of what firms were up against. “But now – after a crushing delay to the reopening road map – the new support measures are limited to those which do not cost the Treasury a penny. “As a small business owner, I understand the importance of being careful with what I spend. But failing to review support deadlines that were designed with a June unlock date in mind is a false economy. “Unless the Government acts now, it risks a serious economic flashpoint this Thursday – a moment at which financial support starts to wind down, further trade changes take effect and repayments on emergency loans start to fall due. “At the very least, HMRC should take a safe harbour approach when they are faced with a small business that has made a mistake or has no cash left – Time To Pay should be promoted and encouraged. The Resolution Foundation has also warned against ‘dangerous complacency’ about cutting the furlough scheme too early. It says the underlying health of the UK labour market is being overstated, as total hours worked are well below pre-crisis levels and underlying pay growth isn’t as strong as the headline number suggest. Britain’s accounting watchdog has opened investigations into PwC and a smaller rival over audits conducted for Greensill Capital UK and the bank owned by one of its largest borrowers, the metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta. The Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) investigations – launched on 15 June but only made public on Monday – add to a growing list of investigations linked to Greensill and its customers, after it fell into administration in March this year. The regulator revealed on Monday it was looking into work conducted by Saffery Champness, which audited Greensill Capital UK’s accounts between 2014 and 2019, over its audit of Greensill for the year ending 31 December 2019. The FRC is also scrutinising PwC over its audit of the 2019 accounts issued by Wyelands Bank, the lender majority-owned by Gupta, the billionaire boss of beleaguered manufacturer Liberty Steel UK. Here’s the full story: Shares in travel and hospitality firms have fallen in London, on fears of a summer “washout” as Spain, Portugal and Malta all tighten their entry requirements on UK tourists. Airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, have fallen by 4.7% this morning. Budget airline easyJet are down 4%, with Wizz Air off 3.7%, and package holiday firm TUI dropping 3.9%. Rolls-Royce, which makes and services jet engines, are down 3.1%. Hotel groups are also lower, with Premier Inns owner Whitbread (-2.3%) and InterContinental Hotels (-2.3%) falling. Earlier today, Portugal announced that British travellers who are not fully vaccinated against coronavirus must quarantine for 14 days on arrival from today. Sky News explain: Anyone travelling to mainland Portugal by air, land or sea will have to prove they have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks ago, or have to isolate. The new rules, introduced by the Portuguese government, come into effect on Monday and will last until at least 11 July. Spain will demand a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination from British tourists who want to enter Mallorca, Ibiza and other Balearic Islands, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday. My colleague Sam Jones explains: The rules – which come into effect in 72 hours, – were announced two days before the Balearics are due to move on to the UK’s green list for quarantine-free travel, and amid growing concerns over what Sánchez called “the negative evolution” of the virus in the UK. Spain had planned initially to let British visitors enter the country without the need for a negative PCR test, but pressure has been mounting on the central government following rising case numbers in the UK and clusters of cases in Spain that were traced back to an end-of-year school trip to Mallorca. And on Friday, Malta said that British holidaymakers who are not fully vaccinated against coronavirus will have to quarantine when they arrive on the island from Wednesday - including children aged 12-16. Today’s falls also follow a report in The Times that Germany will attempt to ban British travellers from the European Union regardless of whether or not they have had a COVID-19 vaccine. The story says: Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, wants to designate Britain as a “country of concern” because the Delta variant is so widespread. The plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU’s integrated political crisis response committee and will be resisted by Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal. President Macron of France has backed mandatory quarantine for unvaccinated travellers. A British government source said that Merkel looked “increasingly isolated”, adding: “A lot of countries will think it’s their own decision and not one to be decided in Berlin.” Last week, Merkel called for all travellers from the UK to be quarantined wherever they arrive in the EU, due to the rise in cases of the Delta variant. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hopes of a late summer rebound in business for the travel sector are fading. “Optimism on the horizon for the travel industry has once again been obscured by dark clouds, as, one by one, European countries bring back in tough quarantine rules. EU leaders are preparing to meet this week and Germany’s Angela Merkel is hoping to gain approval for a consensus on quarantine to stop the spread of the delta variant. So, it’s looking increasingly likely this summer will be a wash out for the industry after all. Tour operator TUI in the FTSE 250 sank by 4% in early trading after Portugal re-imposed strict isolation requirements for unvaccinated arrivals. Although some routes are still open for holiday makers who have been double jabbed, that could soon change. With the rules for children and teenagers also unclear, many families, once hopeful for a holiday, are now putting away their suitcases, settling for a summer of staycations and day trips. Streeter adds that the ‘ever-changing’ rules regarding foreign travel are making it very hard to plan an overseas holiday: Already disappointment had been swirling around the industry after the UK government only extended the green list of travel countries with a handful of new destinations. Although a rush of bookings came with the inclusion of Malta, Madeira, Spain’s Balearic Islands and a number of Caribbean islands, Malta’s move to re-impose quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals was a blow. The ever-changing rules and restrictions mean that trying to plan an overseas holiday has become like a game of snakes and ladders. A relaxation of the rules by one country, is swiftly followed by a tightening in another, leaving travellers at risk of being left isolated in a hotel overseas with only a TV remote control for company. Over in Germany, import prices have jumped sharply - partly due to the recovery in oil prices and the jump in commodity prices. Destatis reports that import prices rose by 1.7% on a monthly basis in May, up from 1.4% in April. On an annual basis, import prices were 11.8% higher than in May 2020 - when the first wave of the pandemic gripped the global economy. That’s the sharpest year-on-year rise in import prices since October 1981, when prices climbed 13.6 percent, the report says. Energy imports were almost twice as expensive last month as in May 2020, with oil up 135%. Metal prices were also much higher, reflecting the pick-up in global demand, Destatis adds: Compared to May 2020, iron ores (+83.6%), copper (+65.1%), non-ferrous metal ores (+46.6%), plastics in primary forms (+42.9%) and pig iron increased in price, Steel and ferro-alloys (+32.4%) significantly. The main reason for the sharp rise in iron ore prices is likely to be the continued strong global demand. Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was delayed today, after heavy rain forced the morning session to be washed out amid widespread disruption. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing halted morning trading after the weather department issued its first “black rainstorm” warning alert of the year. Heavy rain led to landslides and severe flooding in some parts of the city, forcing flight delays, and the temporary suspension of public services such as schools and Covid-19 vaccinations. Trading began in the afternoon after the warning was downgraded, with the Hang Seng index dipping slightly - energy and materials companies dropped, but consumer and healthcare firms were higher. The South China Morning Post has more details on the storm: The Observatory issued the black rainstorm warning at 8.20am, later reporting that more than 200mm of rain had fallen on Lantau Island, Lamma Island and the western part of Hong Kong Island as of 12.30pm, with other areas sustaining at least 70mm of rainfall. A landslide at about 8am on Lantau Island blocked two lanes of traffic, police said, while four other landslides and flooding were reported on Cheung Chau. Video shared on social media showed a torrent of muddy water spilling from a hillside onto South Lantau Road near Upper Cheung Sha Beach. Flooding also caused the closure of the Tuen Mun Chek Lap Kok Tunnel Road towards Tuen Mun earlier, though it had been fully reopened by 11.41am. In the New Territories, police attributed a fatal traffic accident to the heavy rains as a bus driver lost control of his vehicle on a wet road in Sheung Shui at about 6.18am. In London, shares in luxury fashion company Burberry have fallen by 6% after it announced that CEO Marco Gobbetti is leaving unexpectedly. The British fashion brand said Gobbetti – who was charged with turning around the business when he took the reins in 2017 – was leaving to take a job in Italy that would allow him to be closer to his family. The luxury Italian group Salvatore Ferragamo, famous for making shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn, announced on Monday it had appointed Gobbetti as its new chief executive. The Burberry chairman, Gerry Murphy, credited the outgoing chief executive with leading the transformation of the brand and business. Murphy said: “The board and I are naturally disappointed by Marco’s decision but we understand and fully respect his desire to return to Italy after nearly 20 years abroad. With the execution of our strategy on track and our outlook unchanged, we are determined to build on Burberry’s strong foundations to accelerate growth and deliver further value for our shareholders.” Gobbetti, a luxury goods veteran who led brands including Céline, Givenchy and Moschino before joining Burberry, is expected to stay in the role until the end of 2021, giving the company time to find a successor. The move means the chief executive will lose all of his unvested share awards, which will lapse in full when he leaves Burberry at the end of the year. Here’s the full story: Burberry are the top faller on the FTSE 100, which is down 34 points or 0.5% this morning at 7101 points. European stock markets have also dipped this morning, with the Stoxx 600 down 0.3%. A gauge of Southeast Asian stocks fell to its lowest level since May 21 today and is almost 7% from a January high, Bloomberg says: Nations from Malaysia to Thailand are struggling to contain the pandemic, clouding recoveries in their economies. Indonesia reported fresh records in daily cases while Thailand suspended dine-in services for a month at restaurants in Bangkok and nearby provinces. “The tightening in restrictions in some parts of Southeast Asia to curb rising Covid-19 cases will hurt domestic demand and hold back economic recovery,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asian research in Singapore at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Given the need for more policy support, especially on the fiscal side, this is weighing on domestic asset prices in those countries.” More here: Virus Lockdowns Send Malaysia Stocks Tumbling to Seven-Month Low Thailand’s stock index dropped to a one-month low today, after new restrictions in Bangkok, and five provinces, were announced. The measures include a ban on restaurant dine-ins in the capital, 9pm closures of shopping malls, and a ban on gatherings over 20 people. Construction sites in the six areas will be shut down, and workers’ camps will be sealed off to contain clusters, after Covid-19 cases were detected at the camps (where tens of thousands of building workers live). Bangkok’s SET Index is down 0.5%, and on track for its eighth consecutive session of losses, as concerns over the economic recovery rise. Reuters adds: Further souring sentiment, the Bank of Thailand’s deputy governor said the economy was expected to return to pre-pandemic levels only in the first quarter of 2023, as the tourism sector has been slow to recover. In Jakarta, the benchmark stock index has fallen 1.4% to its lowest closing level in a month, after Indonesia reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases yesterday. AFP has the details: Indonesia set a new record for daily coronavirus cases on Sunday with more than 21,000, as hospitals are flooded with patients in Jakarta and other Covid-19 hotspots across Southeast Asia’s hardest-hit nation. The figure brings the country’s tally for the pandemic to more than 2.1 million coronavirus cases with 57,138 deaths. But the real number is believed to be much higher due to low testing rates for the deadly respiratory illness. Yesterday, Gemma Holliani Cahya wrote about the terrible situation in Indonesia, where deaths have risen in recent weeks - and the pressure for tighter lockdowns to slow the virus. President Joko Widodo insists the existing restrictions on public mobility are still the best option so as not to harm the economy, as well as social and political activities. Health experts have criticised the decision, urging the government to take radical action to save the nation and halt the spread of the virus. Hermawan Saputra, from the Indonesian Public Health Experts Organisation (IAKMI), has said the crisis has been exacerbated by travel during the Idul Fitri national holiday and the spread of the more contagious Delta variant. “We are in a very worrying situation. With this condition we recommend regional lockdown,” Hermawan said, to stop the virus spreading to other islands in the archipelago. Malaysia’s stock market has fallen to a seven month low, after Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin extended the country’s lockdown due to elevated Covid-19 infections. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has dropped by 1.2% today, to its lowest level since 10th November (when Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine successful trial results sparked a global rally): The Straits Times has more details of Malaysia’s move: Malaysia will extend its full lockdown until daily new Covid-19 cases drop below 4,000, and its targets on vaccination and intensive care unit (ICU) bed usage are met, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Sunday (June 27). The lockdown was originally due to end on Monday, but Malaysia is still averaging above 5,000 cases a day nearly four weeks into the lockdown. It recorded 5,586 new cases and 60 deaths on Sunday. The country also spent much of May under a more relaxed nationwide lockdown after a drastic spike in cases beginning April this year. South Africa’s rand has weakened today, following the two-week tightening of restrictions to try to combat the rise in Covid-19 cases. The rand has dropped by around 0.7% to 14.24 to the US dollar following president Cyril Ramaphosa’s warning that South Africa faces a “massive resurgence of infections”. These curbs on gatherings, alcohol sales, dining in restaurants and travel will be assessed in two weeks, to see if they have helped to slow the wave of Covid-19 cases. Ramaphosa said during his televised address to the nation that the aim is to limit social contacts while preserving the economy. Analysts at Nedbank wrote in a note that the restrictions are likely to hamper growth, though: This scenario, although necessary, is likely to hamper an already faltering economy, and the rand is likely to remain under pressure, with any strength in the local unit likely to be met with fresh demand for US dollars.” More here: REUTERS: South Africa’s rand weakens as government tightens COVID-19 restrictions Early in June, the rand touched a 28-month high against the dollar, but has fallen back since (partly on worries that America’s central bank would raise interest rates earlier than thought, which pushed up the dollar). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are subdued today amid a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. In Australia, outbreaks of the Delta variant have been detected at several locations including Sydney, while South Africa is tightening restrictions after seeing a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases which is threatening to overwhelm its health system. Other countries are also battling a fresh wave, with Indonesia reporting its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases on Saturday, putting hospitals in the country under huge pressure. Malaysia is extending its lockdown, and Thailand announced new restrictions in and around Bangkok - including curbs on large gatherings and indoor restaurant dining. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said all gatherings, indoors and outdoors, would be banned for 14 days, along with the sale of alcohol, dining in restaurants and travel to or from the worst-hit areas of the country. An extended curfew is also being imposed, and schools shut early for holidays. Ramaphosa warned: “We have overcome two decisive waves but now we have a new hill to climb, a great challenge, a massive resurgence of infections … a devastating wave.” The surge is part of a wider devastating resurgence of COVID-19 infections across Africa, which health experts fear will surpass earlier waves, as countries have struggled to vaccinate even a small percentage of the populations. The rise in Covid-19 cases and restrictions threaten hopes for a strong economic recovery from the shock of the pandemic, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, explains: Malaysia has extended is MCO national lockdown once again. Thailand has tightened restrictions in Bangkok. Jakarta, where I am based, is in a dark place, with cases surging, with that pattern being repeated across Java. In Australia, the Greater Sydney area lockdown was widened, and Darwin also entered a snap lockdown with the trans-Tasman air bubble suspended until the end of tomorrow. Milder restrictions in the Wellington area of New Zealand were all extended Although much has been made about the vaccine progress in the US, the UK, and Europe, Covid-19 and its new delta variant remain a severe problem for much of the world. Nowhere more so than Asia, with Japan and Taiwan also dealing with persistent virus cases and Singapore subject to still-severe, domestic restrictions. I have stated before that resurgent Covid-19 posed the largest threat to the post-pandemic economic bounce across Asia. We are not there yet, but if we are at this point this time next month, many economic forecasts will need to be revisited for surgery. Global markets had hit record highs last week, lifted by the agreement of a $1tn US bipartisan infrastructure package, and hopes that rising inflationary pressures will be temporary. Traders also have an eye on Friday’s US non-farm payroll, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring in America this month (up to around 675,000, from 559,000 in May).

New solar farm applications for sites across Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Essex in the last five months have climbed to 840 megawatts, or the same as 2m household solar panels. The solar boom is expected to yield more than double the solar energy capacity that came forward for the east of England in the same months last year, and would be enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes with clean energy. Dr Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy, said it was “crucial that this momentum is maintained” to help meet the UK’s climate targets and “also help stimulate much-needed new investment in the region”. Most of these new solar farms will be built on former agricultural land as landowners begin to swap growing crops for generating clean electricity, according to UK Power Networks, which manages the local electricity grid. The east of England is particularly popular with renewable energy developers because of its flat fields and sunny weather. However, more landowners are beginning to pursue solar power in the area after UK Power Networks scrapped the upfront cost to connect to the local energy grid. Under new rules put in place at the beginning of 2020, solar farm developers can connect to the grid cheaper and faster in exchange for allowing UK Power Networks to reduce their electricity output at times of low energy demand. The scheme led to a nine-year high in the number of solar farm applications to connect to the UK Power Networks grid last year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and could help the UK to increase its renewable energy without overpowering the system when solar power outstrips local energy demand. UK Power Networks said the number of applications to connect batteries has also spiralled compared with last year. Nine new battery applications were accepted between January and May this year, with a power rating of 385MW, up from only three projects totalling 27.5MW in the same months last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/jun/22/australia-politics-live-barnaby-joyce-scott-morrison-covid-nsw-sydney-victoria","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-22T08:25:47Z","webTitle":"New South Wales records 10 new cases; Joyce sworn in as deputy PM – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/22/australia-politics-live-barnaby-joyce-scott-morrison-covid-nsw-sydney-victoria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/22/australia-politics-live-barnaby-joyce-scott-morrison-covid-nsw-sydney-victoria","fields":{"headline":"New South Wales records 10 new cases; Joyce sworn in as deputy PM – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we will wrap up the blog for Tuesday evening. Here’s what you might have missed today: Barnaby Joyce was sworn in as deputy prime minister and faced his first question time since returning to the job. New South Wales recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19, on top of the two previously reported, taking the total in the Bondi cluster to 21. All but two of the cases were already isolating, and six are household contacts. NSW has extended the mask mandate indoors for Sydney for another week Queensland reported one new case of Covid-19, a man in his 60s tested who visited the Portuguese Family Centre at Ellen Grove at the same time as a woman who tested positive on Sunday. Queensland and South Australia will open the borders to Victoria from Friday. The Northern Territory will require people visiting from the Waverley or Woollahra local government areas to go into quarantine for 14 days. The NSW government said in handing down its budget on Tuesday it expects a $466m surplus in 2024-25 Amy Remeikis will be back with you tomorrow morning for the second-last sitting day of the Winter sitting calendar. The Morrison government is facing calls from its powerful security committee to list the entirety of Hizballah as a terrorist organisation under the criminal code. This evening, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security published its report on the government’s plans to re-list Hizballah’s External Security Organisation (ESO), which has been designated in that way since 2003. The committee backed the re-listing – which will be the seventh. But the committee chair, Liberal senator James Paterson, told the Senate this evening that the committee “was concerned by the decision to, at this stage, only re-list Hizballah’s ESO”. Paterson said the committee’s previous review in 2018 recommended extending the listing to include Hizballah’s military wing: “In this report the committee goes a step further. We recommend the government consider listing Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organisation. We do so based on the expert evidence received by the committee that the distinction that we currently draw between Hizballah’s ESO and the rest of Hizballah is an arbitrary one.” Paterson said Australia’s position of listing only the ESO was “increasingly isolated internationally”. “Twenty-two countries and two regional organisations list them in their entirety, including our Five Eyes allies such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada; like-minded countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; and Arab countries and groupings including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League.” Labor’s Kristina Keneally told the Senate: “This is a bipartisan report, unanimously supported.” The chief health officer of the Northern Territory has declared the Waverley Council and Woollahra Council local government areas Covid-19 hotspots, following the Bondi outbreak growing to 21 cases. Anyone who arrives in the NT from these areas from 5pm on 22 June must undertake 14 days of mandatory, supervised quarantine at the Alice Springs or Howard Springs quarantine facilities. They must also go into quarantine if they are defined as a close contact by NSW Health. Anyone who arrived in the NT between 11 June and 5pm 22 June from those areas must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days in their home or a suitable place if they’re defined as a close contact. They must remain in quarantine, except to get tested, until noon on the 14th day after they were in a case location, regardless of if they receive a negative result. People who are considered casual contacts and arrived in the same time period must get tested and isolate until they get a negative result. After South Australia and Queensland’s decision to remove quarantine restrictions from Melbourne this coming Friday, Western Australia could remove the quarantine requirement next week, AAP reports. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, says that requirement will likely be removed by next week assuming Victoria remains on its current trajectory of Covid-19 cases. But McGowan indicated the rules for NSW visitors could change in the next few days. People who have been in NSW must isolate until they return a negative test, while anyone who has visited exposure sites must serve the full 14 days quarantine. “We have a pretty strong arrangement in place for NSW currently but if we need to tighten it further, we will,” McGowan told reporters. New South Wales Health has announced the following Covid-19 exposure sites. People who attended at the listed times must call NSW Health on 1800 943 553, get tested and isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result: Wallabies Thai Restaurant (anyone who dined in the outside area), Mascot, Saturday 19 June between 11.30am and 12pm Chanel fragrance and beauty, Level 4, Westfield Bondi, Friday 18 June between 12pm and 12.25pm ANZ 20 Martin Place (anyone on Level 2), Sydney, Thursday 17 June between 11:45am and 3:15pm Anyone who was at the following venues must get tested and isolate until a negative result is returned: Wallabies Thai Restaurant (anyone who dined inside), Mascot, Saturday 19 June between 11.30am and 12pm Starbucks, Level 2, Westfield Bondi, Friday 18 June, between 11am and 12pm ANZ 20 Martin Place (Anyone on Ground and Level 1), Sydney, Thursday 17 June 2021 between 11:45am and 3:15pm Anyone who attended the following places at the listed times should monitor for symptoms and if they appear, isolate and get tested until a negative result is received: Mascot Central Shopping Precinct Etherden Walk, Mascot Anytime from Friday 18 June 2021 to Tuesday 22 June 2021. NSW Health also says fragments of the Covid-19 virus have been found in the Brooklyn and Lough Park sewerage treatment plants, which cover Dangar Island, Cowan, Brooklyn, Mooney Mooney, Cheerio Point, Clovelly, Waverley, Randwick, Centennial Park, Queens Park, Bondi, Bondi Junction, Bellevue Hill, Double Bay, Woollahra. People in those areas are being advised to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they appear. Josh Taylor is coming to my rescue and unchaining me from the blog so I will leave you in his wonderful hands to take you through the evening. There is a bit of a subdued feeling in the building at the moment – I think the events of the last two days are starting to settle in. Today was just a taster. A very big thank you to my eyes, ears and the blog’s heart, Mike Bowers, for all his work today (and always) and to Katharine Murphy, Daniel Hurst, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for all their brains, work and humour. But as always the biggest thank you has to go to you – thank you for making it all worth it. I’m working my way back through the messages. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts, comments and musings (and even the criticisms) – they always make me think, which, when it’s as fast-paced as this project is, is a very good thing. I’ll be back tomorrow for another day of the Barnaby show – don’t expect too much from Scott Morrison this week, particularly when it comes to Labor, who are deliberately doing all they can to sideline the prime minister from the parliament while he attends remotely. Can’t imagine he is enjoying the week, given how much he likes to control the messaging, and the House. Have a lovely evening, and have fun with Josh. I’ll see you soon – and as always, take care of you. Over in the House of Representatives, MPs have just debated a motion from the independent Zali Steggall to disallow $50m in funding allocated to developing the gas reserves in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. (This measure is part of the Morrison government’s gas fired recovery). The Steggall motion triggered a debate in the Labor caucus a couple of weeks ago when the recommendation came to vote against the Beetaloo disallowance. Labor MPs including Ged Kearney, Libby Coker and Graham Perrett said supporting new gas development wasn’t a great idea. Joel Fitzgibbon and Bill Shorten were among other Labor MPs who supported the recommendation to the caucus. In any case, the motion has been debated. Steggall’s proposal was seconded by fellow independent Helen Haines and backed by the Greens leader Adam Bandt. Both Coalition and Labor MPs voted against the Steggall proposal, so it was defeated. The Senate has rearranged its business this evening, at the government’s motion. First up is the attempt to disallow the government’s changes to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency that allowed it to invest in carbon capture and storage. The Greens believed votes on this would be tight - but given the government is bringing this on for a vote it seems likely the Coalition and One Nation will team up to defeat it. If it’s not disallowed, it may only be a matter of time before the instrument is in the courts, because even the Liberal-controlled delegated legislation committee doesn’t think it is consistent with the Act. After that are a series of government bills, including the Online Safety bill which Labor has offered its support for. Last is the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No.1) Bill 2021. The Greens expect the government will amend its own bill gutting the proposed changes to local content rules after a critical report from the Senate communications committee. These matters will be wrapped up by votes at 9:15pm, if not sooner. There is a lot at stake over not acting on climate change, or doing whatever can be done to ensure at least some of the Great Barrier Reef survives in a warming climate. As Save the Children’s Paul Mitchell points out, that includes Australia’s responsibility to our neighbours: The knock on impacts extend to our Pacific neighbours, such as Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The threats facing the Great Barrier Reef, such as increasing ocean acidification and temperatures, more intense storms and increasing coastal flooding, impact smaller reefs across the Pacific. Reefs in these countries provide vital contributions to livelihoods and food security in some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities. Unaddressed, this will reduce the food security of people who rely on reef fish and undermine their way of life. As reefs bleach and die, the protection they provide coastal communities from storm surges also erodes - leaving people more exposed to increasingly fierce storms.” Liberal MP Dave Sharma was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing reminding us that there are Liberals who will push back against the Nationals increasingly loud rumblings on climate and net zero by 2050: I don’t expect the prime minister will change his position on this. This is a position the cabinet has adopted and reflects the leadership of his party, the Liberal party. It is not a position on the Nationals but in terms of the Liberal party, the prime minister has articulated our views and position on this. He is a leader of the government and the Nationals form part of that government. What he’s had to say on this remains government policy and will continue to remain government policy. I’m not going to pretend there aren’t internal differences of view within our Coalition about this but there are equally internal differences of view within Labor about this – and I won’t seek to capitalise on those and exaggerate those here. We do need to build a broad political consensus within Australia. That involves regions and cities and different states and the more resource-exposed industries if we’re to get this done. The fact we’ve got different representatives who represent different electorates and different views is not all that surprising. As has been pointed out, Barnaby Joyce had daughters his entire political career before this point as well. Today he raised it in question time. Terri Butler was asked about the ‘as the father of daughters’ line while on the ABC and said: Look, I really think people are sick of men in power pointing to the fact they have daughters when they’re asked about issues relating to the status of women. I don’t think it goes very well at all. I think what people want is to see a more diverse parliament, a more diverse government and a government that treats issues relating to women and women’s safety seriously. This year has been a terrible year for this government when it comes to issues relating to the treatment of women. They need to do better. The deputy prime minister of Australia cannot just bat away this really serious question by pointing to the fact he’s a father of daughters. People are really sick of that stuff. They actually want to see real action. I think people take issue with it because women are human beings with inherent value. They’re not just of value because men have female relations. I think people take issue with it because women should be seen as people who are entitled to expect to live in a safe and prosperous nation. And they shouldn’t have to appeal to people’s sense of possession or the fact they’ve got daughters or sense of, because I’ve got daughters, now women become important when they weren’t before. That’s not the way the world works. Women are people. Women’s rights ... human rights. It’s been said for decades and remains true. So this whole situation of having the men of the Liberal and National party stand up and pretend they couldn’t possibly have any problems with the issues, the serious issues relating to the treatment of women and women’s safety in this country because they have female relatives, is nonsense and people are sick of it. Over in the Senate: In the Coalition party room blue on childcare, two senators indicated they may cross the floor: National Matt Canavan and Liberal Gerard Rennick. Canavan kicked off the debate by saying he didn’t support the bill unless there was extra support for parents to care for their children in their own homes. Rennick later said he would struggle to vote for additional support for the sector which already receives $10bn per year. Rennick told Guardian Australia: I’m not happy about the bill – I think we should give a payment to all parents and then they work out how they spend that. Childcare doesn’t help shift workers, it doesn’t help mothers on a farm, or people who do a couple of hours of work but don’t need eight hours of care [the fortnightly minimum to receive childcare subsidies]. This sector receives $10bn – and it all goes into the pockets of the childcare centre owners and unions.” Rennick said the government’s policy “shouldn’t distinguish between stay-at-home parents and those that return to work”, noting that while tens of thousands of parents may want to go back to work if childcare subsidies were higher “how many at work would rather stay at home if they had that choice?” He said: I understand why many want to go back to work. I understand they don’t want to give up their careers. But this is about choice and basically ensuring equality of choice.” Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton have the Queensland government’s side of the Unesco news: Queensland’s environment minister says UN officials recommending the Great Barrier Reef be placed on the world heritage “in danger” list shows the Morrison government must do more to deal with the climate crisis. Meaghan Scanlon’s comments put the state government at odds with the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has accused the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of a “complete subversion of normal process”. Ley on Tuesday said the UN body assured her department a week ago it would not suggest an “in danger” listing. The Australian government has vowed to fight the recommendation, which will be considered by the 21-member world heritage committee next month. Queensland’s environment minister said she did not want the reef placed on the list but the recommendation clearly “shows that more needs to be done and the world is watching”. The Greens have tried this a few times (and been blocked or gagged) and it looks like the Senate president is making moves to stop them from trying to move it again. The new skilled job shortage list is out. Here is how Mike Bowers saw QT: When Barnaby Joyce first started speaking, Ed Husic could be heard saying, “This is like The Shining! Here’s Barnaby!’ I guess the best horror movies are the ones based on real life. As Amy noted, Bob Katter asked Barnaby Joyce in question time if he was “aware that China holds the chairmanship of Unesco, currently meeting in China”. It was a prelude to Katter suggesting Unesco’s recommendation overnight that the Great Barrier Reef be listed as “in danger” was “a serious erosion of Australia’s sovereignty and another intrusion into the control room of our country” – with China apparently behind it. The question was passed to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who might have pointed out that she was not aware that China held the chairmanship of Unesco. Because it doesn’t. The chair of Unesco’s executive board is Agapito Mba Mokuy, from Equatorial Guinea. The director general is Audrey Azoulay, from France. Neither is Chinese. As Ley pointed out, China is chair of the World Heritage Committee and will next month host a meeting that will consider the recommendation. Australia also has a seat on the 21-member committee. The Morrison government believes China may be behind the Unesco decision to recommend the reef be listed as “in danger” but the minister has pulled up short of saying so, leaving the accusations to the Australian and Katter. Both seem well briefed on what the government thinks. Here’s our latest story on the issue: Queensland minister says UN warning on Great Barrier Reef status shows Morrison must act. But what wasn’t answered there is very interesting – these are the issues Peter Dutton interjected on, to stop Barnaby Joyce from having to answer. Bob Katter’s question on China and Unesco (jumped up before Joyce had a chance to object himself). Criticism from Mia Davies, who leads the WA Nationals (again, Dutton jumped up, but the question was still ruled in order). His previous comments on the Biloela family (Joyce nodded at Dutton halfway through this question, and Dutton jumped up the moment it was completed). Whether any policy agreement had been made with Scott Morrison (again, Dutton jumped up to object immediately). Well. That was a nice return to 2014. Barnaby is back and so are the coal wars (they never went away – it is just open warfare now). It is over. While this motion comes to its end, Labor MP Amanda Rishworth has responded to an earlier post about the debate in the Coalition party room over childcare. “What century are we in, when we have members of the federal government shaming women for using childcare?” Rishworth told Guardian Australia. “It should not be left to female members of the government to teach their male colleagues why childcare is important for equality. “This is just completely archaic and shows how out of touch this government is with the reality of working families.” The suspension of standing orders is to discuss this motion: A, there is a global pandemic. B, the government had two jobs this year, to roll out the vaccine and establish a safe national system of quarantine. C, instead of effectively rolling out the vaccine, and establishing a safe national system of quarantine and, the incoming deputy prime minister has been focusing on his own job. D, instead of focusing on the needs of Australians, the Abbott-Truss, Turnbull-Truss, Turnbull-Joyce, Morrison-Joyce, Morrison-McCormack and now Morrison-Joyce (government) has been focused on itself. And, E, instead of building the jobs of the future, the incoming deputy prime minister has said investing in renewables is “insane and lemming like”, and said the Nationals have always been opposed to a net zero target. And ... therefore calls on members of the Morrison-Joyce government to focus on the needs of Australians and not their own jobs. (It will be defeated, because Labor does not have the numbers. These motions are only to get TV and social media grabs, because you can say all your talking points at a time in parliament that gets the most coverage. Which is also why so many answers from government ministers are outrageous – gotta get those clicks.) Goodness, Peter Dutton is getting a workout today. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “Will he negotiate a new agreement on policy with the prime minister and will that be made public?” Sgt Dutton: You have ruled on that as recently as yesterday. This is a backdoor way of talking about Coalition agreement, which is not the subject of the deputy prime minister’s portfolio responsibilities. It is not within order to go to the detail of that and the precedent is very clear in relation to these matters. Tony Burke gets up again: The question doesn’t go to an agreement between the parties, it goes to whether there is an agreement being sought between the deputy prime minister and the prime minister about policy. If that is put in the Coalition agreement then the leader of the house is the first to announce that. That is not what the question asks. Tony Smith rules the question out of order – not for Dutton’s point, but because it is not part of his ministerial responsibilities. He goes to move on, but Anthony Albanese moves to suspend standing orders. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “The National Farmers’ Federation has backed the net zero target for emissions by 2050. Are the regional Australians who want the job opportunities from (that) including the National Farmers’ Federation wrong?” Joyce (who is having the time of his life and repeatedly saying “laser-like focus”): I thank the member for Grayndler for his question, I note his reference to job opportunities. This side will always be the side of the House that is absolutely focused on job opportunities and making sure people maintain their jobs. The sort of place we will be focusing on ... to keep their jobs – is the member for Capricornia, coal miners in that seat. We will have a laser-like focus on the member for Flynn’s seat so that those miners keep their jobs. We will be laser-like focused on all the people in the seat of Paterson to make sure they keep their jobs and the member for Shortland, we will be laser-like focused to make sure the people in the seat keep their jobs. We will be laser-like in our focus to make sure they keep their jobs and you keep yours. We want to keep his job. We want him to remain the leader of the opposition, we want him to stay there for years and years and years. We want you to get long service leave as the leader of opposition, because on the side we care about jobs, and I know it’s hard for the member for Grayndler because you are tied to the aspirations of an inner-suburban electorate and Green preference and that is a tough sell. (Tony Smith tells him to be relevant) Joyce: I’m sorry. I take your instruction, Mr Speaker. Talking about regional jobs, as leader of the opposition brought up, yes, on our side we focus on regional jobs all the time ... Like the live cattle trade. We focused on regional jobs that would be lost when you brought in a carbon tax. What we note is when we focus on regional jobs – now there is within the opposition two groups, one group that’s kind of supposed to be in the Labor party but not really and wish they weren’t. (Smith pulls him up again) Joyce: We are doing a very good job on regional jobs. Looks like there has been some talks beforehand about how to protect Barnaby Joyce from questions – in the middle of this one from Anthony Albanese, Joyce turns to Peter Dutton and gives him a very firm nod. Albanese: I refer to his quote this month when he said ‘Tharnicaa and Kopika were born in Australia, maybe if their names were Jane and Sally, would think twice about sending them back to another country which they are not from’. In his capacity as minister for regional development, does he still support the government letting them and their family go back to Biloela in Queensland? Dutton gets up immediately, almost before Albanese has left the box. Dutton: The (question’s) aim is to hold ministers (to) account for their portfolio responsibilities. This is not within the ministerial responsibilities of the deputy prime minister, and that is very clear. As such, the question should be ruled out of order. Tony Burke argues it is relevant: Mr Speaker, to the point of order, there are many times in this house where ministers have answered questions where they do not have the decision making within their portfolio, but the outcome of the decision making is relevant to the areas they represent. It happens in agriculture all the time, it happens in regional Australia all the time, where if there is an impact on their stakeholders, they take questions. And there will be days of parliament where on the basis of what the minister has said or what the house has said, almost all of the government’s questions from the outside would be ruled out, if that were to be the standard. This question goes immediately to the impact on regional Australia, and whether the minister will be advocating in that way or not. I will put it in these terms, Mr Speaker. When a trade agreement is agreed, there is one minister responsible for the trade agreement, but we get 10 questions across the whole front bench because they have stakeholder interests ... Here, regional Australia has a stakeholder interest. In this family. And that is what is being asked. Tony Smith rules the question out of order: He is being asked about a statement he made ... when he was a backbencher not the deputy prime minister, and the this is made very clear, those questions are out of order. I know he is being to answer it, if the question is out of order, it’s out of order, as simple as that. So Joyce avoids having to answer the question – which is what the government wants. To prove that point, here is how Barnaby Joyce finishes that answer: We are the party that looks after regional Australia, we continue to look after regional Australia, and that is why regional Australia votes for us and you have left them so far behind that there is only a couple of seats left, one is up there [Joel Fitzgibbon], and he is only just with you, he is only just with you, and the rest have all gone! Barnaby Joyce isn’t addressing any of his answers to anyone other than the backbenchers. His whole shtick is about ‘power’ and coming out strong with attacks, so even though nothing changes in terms of policy or actual action, it seems a lot more energised. So none of this is about anything other than throwing some weight around. And he’ll keep doing it, because that’s what he does. Nothing of substance changes though, other than people get a lot rowdier with the things they were already saying. Labor’s Anne Aly to Barnaby Joyce: “My question is to the deputy prime minister, and I refer to yesterday’s comments by the WA Nationals leader, Mia Davies, who in 2018 called the deputy prime minister to resign. I quote, ‘I am disappointed the party felt they needed to change leaders. It shows they are focused on internal matters instead of the people of regional Australia’. In his capacity as minister for regional water development, is Davies correct? Peter Dutton interjects: I believe that question should be ruled out of order. The deputy prime minister does not have responsibility in relation to those comments that the honourable member has cited. I don’t know the accuracy of those comments, and I don’t think the deputy prime minister should be asked to respond to it. Tony Smith: I am going to rule the question out of order and give the opportunity to the member for Cowan to rephrase the question, and I tell you why. I have made it very clear in the past, and I know the member for Isaacs hasn’t forgotten this, that the substance of the question has to be in order. In other words, you cannot use the majority of what is asked, and that is deliberately out of order, and then simply bolt on the reference to the ministerial responsibility out of it and. In other words, there was very little question and a lot of comment about what was related to internal party matters, which is prohibited ... But I am happy to hear from the leader of the opposition of business on this. Anthony Albanese objects: The quote from Mia Davies is about, the quote is, I think it’s because they’re focused on internal matters instead of the people of regional Australia. There cannot be any quote more in order than to ask the minister for regional water development whether or not there focused on the interests of regional Australia or internal matters. Smith changes his mind and Joyce has to answer the question. He just talks about regional grants. And yet, if everything was going amazing for regional Australia, why did the Nationals have to change leaders again? How terrible it is that Barnaby Joyce finds it demeaning to address his past behaviour in parliament. It must be so difficult being back doing that, in exactly the position he wanted back, and got back. Thoughts and prayers. Catherine King to Barnaby Joyce: “This week the assistant minister for children and families, the member for Capricornia, said of the deputy prime minister – if he got the job again there would be women out there who would be unhappy with that. “Is the assistant minister correct or is the deputy prime minister’s return to the job good for the women of regional Australia?” Joyce: I respect the right of any person to make their concerns clear, and I make sure I stay in close correspondence with both my colleagues and my family. And by so doing, I endeavour to make sure as we all do, to try to make the better person of myself. I know that it is imperative that in the considerations I had over three years on the back bench, that like all of us, we have to see our way to a better self, and I am doing that, and I find that it’s a little bit demeaning though to go through to litigate this at the despatch box but I’m happy that is what you want to do. Josh Frydenberg shouts about some things. Julie Collins to Barnaby Joyce: “In his capacity for minister for regional development, what does the deputy prime minister to say to women in agriculture?” Joyce: I thank the member for her question, might I say, as a father of four daughters ... I have an incredible vested interest in making sure women in agriculture and every section of society have the best opportunity in the safest environment they could possibly live in. In agriculture, as we well know, so many businesses are a partnership, where that family unit is instrumental in the success of the operation. That was the family unit I grew up in with my mother and my father, and where mother, if she wasn’t running the finances of the farm, she was also at times the worker in the paddocks with Dad. In farming, it is really, truly a partnership between both the mother and father, and the unit, to try and make sure that business operation works. More so, I would say many other areas of work within the nation. Without a shadow of a doubt, I have the greatest respect for what is truly part of the reason the Australian agriculture has had success that it has had. Bob Katter asks a question that is a bit of a curve ball: The deputy prime minister, the Courier Mail front page said David Attenborough labelled the Great Barrier Reef magnificent, not endangered but magnificent. China holds the chairmanship of Unesco, currently meeting in China. Isn’t the proposed declaration by Unesco of the Barrier Reef as endangered a serious erosion of Australia’s sovereignty and another intrusion into the control room of our country? Peter Dutton is on his feet in less than two seconds to stop Barnaby Joyce from answering the question. He says it is one for the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Katter says as much as he loves the leader of the house, it’s a question on sovereignty not the environment. Tony Smith says Joyce can pass the question on to someone else, if he wishes. Which is true, but he didn’t ask to do that – he didn’t have a chance to do that. Dutton was on his feet doing it first. So it seems that the government doesn’t trust Joyce to speak on issues involving China. Take from that what you will. This entire question time is just an exercise in ego. I honestly cannot imagine why anyone would tune into this, if they didn’t have to. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “I refer to the deputy prime minister’s statement: ‘I don’t want the government anymore in my life. I am sick of the government being in my life!’ “Does the deputy prime minister agree, government has a role to play in securing regional Australia’s recovery from Covid, including a good and effective vaccine rollout and creation of national quarantine, and isn’t that just a wacky thing for the deputy prime minister to say?” Joyce, who is already back to shouting everything while eagerly looking back to his benches for encouragement, or I don’t know, a treat: I suppose I was reflecting on what would have happened if the member for Grayndler was in government. And I must say, at the time it was terrifying, it was terrifying. I was overcome with fear. Fear and trepidation. As to what might happen if the Labor party was to be the government. But later on, after I cooled down, I realised, we are the government, everything was fine. Going to the rollout, we have over 6.6 million people, I think, have now been part of the process of being vaccinated, and that’s a great outcome, one in four adults, one in four adults. And Australia has ... a sense of pride about what we have been able to do, what we have been able to do in other areas, where hundreds of thousands of people have died. Other nations, where millions of people have died. Australia has been so blessed, and we have also been so fortuitous, and we also have the best government in place! We have had the best government in place*. And it’s because ... of the diligence, because of the diligence. *If it was the best government, then why the need for the change? Joyce continues, but honestly, it’s just more shouty guff. Then Greg Hunt gets up and adds to it. Joyce then moves on to a dixer, which is just all about coal. Australia, this is your government. Scott Morrison once again warns of all the uncertain times Australia is living in. Tony Burke pops up to ask where the prime minister is, because the screen is blank. Then Scott Morrison turns up on the screen. But the sound is all the way up, so he is distorted. All in all it’s going exactly as well as you would think it is. It’s the Barnaby Joyce show today. Anthony Albanese says to the current deputy prime minister: “The deputy prime minister has mounted two leadership challenges: one on the very day on which this parliament honoured bushfire survivors, and one during a global pandemic. Why is the deputy prime minister only focused on his own job, and not on the real needs of Australians, including those in regional communities?” Joyce: I thank the honourable member for his question and first and foremost I would like to say a huge thank you to the work for the member of Riverina, who did a remarkable job. A man who is noted for the ... way he conducted his office, a person who will go on to serve and further represent our nation as a person, an incredible asset, and here I am. We know there is a sense of division on the other side, because I think I am looking at someone here who might be under a little bit of pressure himself. A little bit of pressure himself. A little bit of pressure himself. And while ... I was on the backbench, I got to know quite a few people from the Labor party, and it’s an interesting conversation to have about the current leader, the current leader, but I tell you what, I tell you what, the member for Grayndler. I am his biggest fan. I am this man’s biggest fan. I want you to be there for the long haul! Albanese interrupts with a point of order on relevance but is overruled. Joyce: Well, thank you, Mr Speaker, and why stop the fun? There is the preamble, there is the outcome. There is the outcome over there ... we know where we’re off to, we know where we’re off to. But I tell you what, when you need the numbers to stay there, come and call me. Because I am you’re biggest supporter. We need you there. We are, we are a big supporter of you, because you are going so very, very well. You are going so very, very well. Every time the member – every time we are struggling with an argument, out in the regions, in Wagga and Beaudesert and Tamworth, if it’s getting a bit uncomfortable for us, we just say the alternative, the alternative, is Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, and then the argument is all over. Like, I just – it’s remarkable, it’s remarkable. You have been here, you were also the deputy prime minister, weren’t you, I think, for 83 days? I hope you enjoyed that experience, because it is as high as you’re ever going to get. Barnaby Joyce is giving the revised ministry list, which includes him as deputy prime minister. Question time is about to begin and Barnaby Joyce is already in the prime minister’s chair. He’s waited three years and three months for this moment. He’s not going to miss it. The Senate, following a motion by Labor senator Katy Gallagher, has ordered Richard Colbeck to table a document outlining the nation’s Covid-19 vaccine supply. That was after Colbeck told the Senate during question time that he would table it in the Monday night Covid committee hearing (and didn’t). So now he has to produce it to the Senate by 7.20pm tonight. That leaves plenty of time for it to suddenly become “cabinet in confidence”. We’ll let you know how that one ends. Question time is in about 15 minutes – and Barnaby Joyce will be in the prime minister’s chair, while Scott Morrison beams in from a screen. In Labor caucus, Anthony Albanese noted the return of Barnaby Joyce by claiming he had “failed” in all his ministries in the last term of government. Albanese said the government is focused on itself not its two principal jobs (hotel quarantine and vaccines). Labor has set up a protecting pensions taskforce – an inquiry to be run by MP Justine Elliot, Peta Murphy and Anthony Chisholm into concerns that the cashless debit card could be expanded to pensioners. The government has never said they would do this but two weeks ago Elliot refused to delete a social media post claiming they might, prompting an argument with the prime minister’s office. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, also warned about how recent Medicare changes will increase patient costs, particularly for surgery, and how this fits in with a “pattern” of government neglect of Medicare. In terms of legislation, Labor will move to amend a government social security bill to remove an eight-day waiting period for people applying for payments online. Labor will support the telecommunications international production orders bill, which makes it easier to share material gathered in Australia with law enforcement in allied countries like the US. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security asked for amendments including ruling out international cooperation for death penalty cases, which Labor believes the government has honoured. How lovely that when the men started speaking nonsense about childcare changes in the Coalition party room meeting, it was the women who had to remind them about equality. Doesn’t seem like any of their male colleagues spoke up in defence. Which is always so much of the problem – women are expected to not only carry their load, but also carry the load men place upon them. A fiery debate took place in the Coalition party room over the government’s proposed childcare changes, with Queensland senators Matt Canavan, Gerard Rennick and MP George Christensen talking about the need to support women who chose to stay at home with their children. Female Liberal MPs, including the minister Jane Hume, Katie Allen, Celia Hammond, Hollie Hughes and Perin Davey, spoke in favour of the changes, saying it was about providing “equality of opportunity”. One of the male MPs suggested that women might be “forced” back to work by the changes, prompting a rebuke from one of the women MPs that it was about “equality of opportunity” and removing barriers. Another MP suggested that women using childcare were “outsourcing parenting” prompting Victorian MP Katie Allen to remind MPs to be cognisant of the language used and to not use language that might be offensive to working women. Hume told MPs that there were about 100,000 women who could not afford to work because of the cost of childcare. One of the male MPs spoke about the need for the government to consider providing financial support to families on farms who accessed help from live-in nannies rather than through the family daycare system. Those job figures are interesting because they show some of the actual week-to-week changes in employment. I only just learned this, but the monthly unemployment data (the one where we get the unemployment rate) doesn’t include non-resident workers who have worked in Australia for less than 12 months. The quarterly data is everyone who has contributed to economic activity, but the monthly data essentially excludes a large chunk of people who are on foreign working visas. Which means that the official job numbers don’t include all the non-permanent resident workers who left Australia during the pandemic. As a blog watcher also just pointed out to me, the payroll figures started to dip when jobkeeper ended. Employment may be up in the monthly figures, but in the two weeks to 5 June, the ABS reports payroll jobs were down. Between the weeks ending 22 May and 5 June 2021: Payroll jobs decreased by 0.9%, compared with an increase of 0.4% in the previous fortnight. Total wages paid decreased by 1.6%, compared with an increase of 0.4% in the previous fortnight. And in the state breakdowns that meant: Payroll jobs: Victoria decreased by 2.1% Tasmania decreased by 1.1% Australian Capital Territory decreased by 1.1% Total wages: Victoria decreased by 2.8% Tasmania decreased by 2.0% The resources minister, Keith Pitt, just held a quick door stop to talk about the radioactive waste management bill (the government had to amend the bill to not name a specific site, because if the community doesn’t want a nuclear waste dump, they can’t be legally bound by it. It’s been one of the hold-ups with the bill and last night, the government folded on it.) Pitt was talking about the “win” with a special guest appearance from Matt Canavan, whose job he took in the cabinet, and who could have a cabinet spot back if he decided he wanted back in now that Barnaby Joyce is back. So not awkward at all. Scott Morrison also said there was a “healing process that needed to occur” in the government and said MPs would “focus on the Australian community and not us”. He also warned there was “no time for individual agendas or pet projects”, saying the focus was on winning the next election “because that’s what Australians need us to do”. Barnaby Joyce has told MPs that he will be a “servant to the party and the nation” while saying the government needs to rally around a “unifying cause” that assures Australians of their freedoms. Talking about a geopolitical shift from “Pax Americana” to China – which he referred to as a “new superpower that is different” – Joyce said voters wanted the government to respond to their concerns about the change. “It’s more important to this nation than anything else,” Joyce said. “The times that we live in today are different to those we were born into, and certainly to what our parents were born into. “But our liberties and freedoms that we took as a birthright ... might be challenged like they never had before. “We need to ensure that we give our children and grandchildren the strength and the liberties and the capacity to say what they like and the capacity to be who they want to be. And the Australian people have to make a decision about who can deliver that. Is that the Labor party or the Liberal-National Coalition? “If we deliver on these questions to the Australian people, there’s only one clear choice.” Joyce’s return to the deputy prime minister’s role was also acknowledged by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who urged the Coalition remain “strong and united”. He said the Coalition would win the next election by being “stable and united”, by showing that “we get stuff done” and by having a “clear plan for the future”. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also spoke at length about the common purpose of the Liberal and National parties. And there was a debate on childcare – we’ll bring you more on that soon. Who would have thunk it? Dominic Perrottet is one of our big-spending treasurers. The New South Wales budget papers reveal he’s increased expenditure by 8.7% in 2020-21 and 7.9% in 2021-22. “It’s a budget with heart,” he explains, when asked about his conversion from economic dry to big spender. And he’s “investing in the future”, he says. The state budget reveals the continuation of many programs designed to stimulate spending during Covid-19 and an increase in wages for the NSW public service. The NSW government had copped flak for announcing it would cap pay rises for state employees at 1.5% during the pandemic, with Labor pointing out that many of these people – nurses, police and ambos – were on the frontline of the Covid response. Now Perrottet, awash with funds from the property boom, is returning to the 2.5% wage cap at an additional cost of $2.7bn to the state wages bill. There are also $100 vouchers for families to teach kids to swim and $100 for people to go out in the Sydney CBD, which remains graveyard-like after we all discovered working from home was better than the office. Thank God it’s Friday – yep, that’s what the program is called. Everything is totally fine: New South Wales will achieve a quicker-than-expected turnaround from the Covid-19 downturn, with the state expected to be back in the black by 2024-25 with a $466m surplus. In the meantime, this year’s 2020-21 deficit has halved to $7.9bn thanks to surging property prices, which have delivered a stamp duty bonanza. But NSW is counting on being able to continue with its “open for business” strategy despite the recent Bondi cluster of Covid cases. It’s also counting on international borders being open by mid 2022. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, says it costs NSW $300m a week not to have international travel. There were very liberal doses of Howard and Menzies quotes about party unification and the strength of the Coalition in the joint party room meeting this morning. (That’s the party room equivalent of posting happy family social media photos when you’re absolutely miserable.) But everyone is totally cool with Barnaby Joyce’s return to the leadership. No one is worried at all. It’s all totally fine. Mike Bowers tells me Darren Chester walked into the House and exclaimed, “Here I am with all my supporters” to the empty benches. So things seem like they are great in the National party room right now. (Chester expects to move back to the backbench now that Barnaby Joyce is in charge again – the two are not exactly friendly and never really have been.) One big happy family: Oh – and David Littleproud says he wasn’t unhappy yesterday, he was just cold. The bells are ringing for the start of parliament. Huzzah! Is a lockdown on the cards for Sydney? Gladys Berejiklian: At this stage we follow Dr Chant and the health advice. At this stage because all but one case is linked to an existing case and that case was only discovered a few hours ago, that gives us a degree of confidence that what we have asked people to do matches the risk that is there at the moment. If that changes, if we suddenly have a number of unlinked cases and if we suddenly have them outside the geographic region they are concentrated in that will obviously adjust the health advice and we will respond to that. At this stage, given Dr Chant did advise us already that she foresaw that household contacts would get the virus, and I think this demonstrates how important it is to isolate when you are asked to isolate. You might have a negative test and no symptoms but subsequently during that 40-day period you start feeling unwell and get tested, we know a family member who was negative on day one might on day five or day 14 become positive and that is why it is really important for everyone to listen to the health advice and please also again refer to Dr Chant’s updated advice in relation to Westfield Bondi. Clearly there had been a number of transmissions in and around that shopping complex and Dr Chant and Health have updated the dates at which you need to get tested and isolate if you had not already followed that instruction. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, confirms it is just two cases authorities are worried about at this point: The two cases that demonstrate risk to the community are a young lady in her 20s who, we believe, acquired infection at the Junction. She is a worker at Bondi Junction and we believe she was exposed again, probably through fleeting contact with one of the infectious people as they moved around Bondi Junction. For this reason, we are calling out for anyone who has been at Bondi Junction, including the car parks, any time between 12 June and 18 June, to get a test. If you’ve been to one of the close contact venues, you should have been contacted about being in isolation for the 14 days or [for] the casual contact venue check the specific advice, but if you don’t have symptoms and are just going forth because we are asking you to attend, you don’t need to self-isolate. What we are asking you to [do is] minimise your contact with others until you have a negative test. This is because we are casting the net very wide because you want to pick up any of these inadvertent transmission. You can see how if we miss a case, over the next cycle of three days [to] a week, we have many cases coming from that single missed case. We want everybody to come forward and get tested. The other case that is under investigation and literally this test result came in a few hours ago, we want to thank and acknowledge the cooperation of the St Charles primary school for their cooperation but I reiterate what the premier has said. The school is working with health officials to develop a plan for the children to be discharged home to their parents and we want to provide advice and a mechanism to get testing because we want to find out how this child was exposed and establish that because cases where we don’t understand the acquisition means we have missed the case, missed cases, and in this case, we don’t have preliminary information, a source for this child’s exposure, so we are looking for an intermediate source. In light of the additional cases (only two of which are not linked to direct cases as yet) the mask restrictions are continuing. Gladys Berejiklian: As a result of what has occurred, the New South Wales government will be extending the existing mask wearing provisions for an additional week. Previously, Wednesday midnight or Thursday morning at 12.01am, the existing ask in relation to masks was to expire. It will now continue as mandatory for another week. We will extend it to all of greater Sydney, excluding the Central Coast and excluding the Hunter. [Under the compulsory mask rule] people will be required to wear masks indoors for hospitality workers, when we are going shopping, going grocery shopping, going to events inside. It is only when you are eating or drinking indoors at a venue that you can’t or shouldn’t wear a mask. In every other circumstance, if you live or are in Sydney, you must wear a mask for another week beyond Wednesday midnight. You can find a little more information on the new Sydney cases here (from NSW Health): There are now 21 cases linked to the Bondi cluster. Of the five locally reported cases to 8pm last night: Two were announced yesterday: A woman in her 50s from Sydney’s northern suburbs. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A man in his 30s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs. He is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. Three further cases were reported to 8pm last night: A woman in her 60s from the Illawarra. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A woman in her 40s from Sydney’s northern suburbs. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A woman in her 20s from the eastern suburbs. She is linked to the Bondi cluster. Further investigations are under way. NSW Health can also advise there have been seven locally acquired cases notified overnight since 8pm. Six of these are household contacts of previous cases who have been in isolation. One case is a child who attends primary school in the eastern suburbs. These seven cases will be included in Wednesday’s numbers. NSW Health is asking anyone who was in Westfield Bondi Junction (including the car park) at any time between 12 June and 18 June to get tested for Covid-19. Only people with symptoms and those who have been to specific exposure venues at the listed times need to test and isolate. Anyone who does not have symptoms and has not been to specific exposure venues at the listed times should get tested but does not need to isolate. However, these people are strongly urged to avoid gatherings and minimise their movements, such as not attending the cinemas or trips to the ski fields until they return a negative test. If you can work from home, please do so. Going through the additional NSW Health data, all but two of those cases were already in isolation. That makes 21 in the Bondi cluster now. We’ll be hearing from Gladys Berejiklian very soon. In total there are 12 cases being reported today, two of which we knew about yesterday – there are another three in today’s numbers and another seven that were recorded after the evening cutoff, which will be in tomorrow’s numbers. There was one new community-acquired case in Queensland, but the chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young is not worried: This is a gentleman in his 60s who attended that restaurant at Ellen Grove at the same time as that person from Portugal attended. He went into home quarantine the next day when he was contacted, so we are just confirming with him whether or not he went out and about on that Sunday morning. All of the 36 people who attended the restaurant during the timeframe when the lady from Portugal did are in home quarantine, so we will continue to assess them and test them going forward for the 14 days. I think that is good news, and that is all in hand. Queensland is opening its borders to Victoria from Friday (1am) – also just in time for the school holidays. Gladys Berejiklian will be holding her press conference at 11.30. She is likely to announce the social distancing measures that are in place will be extended. Lilley Labor MP Anika Wells was sent out with something to say this morning: Barnaby Joyce may be the only dinosaur to ever come back from extinction. Literally no one in my electorate has been calling on us, here in the Australian parliament, to bring back the bonk, but here we are. In a national reckoning about the appalling treatment of women in workplaces, we now have this. Apparently, the idea that there are no permanent consequences for anyone about this culture, except the women themselves. Since I was elected to this place two years ago, I have been constantly, incredulously asking: “What does it take to get sacked by Scott Morrison?” But this week, I now have to ask: “What standards of behaviour is Scott Morrison prepared to accept from the second-highest office in the land?” It’s like the Coalition has brought back their unhinged, creepy uncle to Christmas lunch, and told him to preside over carving the turkey, but the consequences are far more serious than that. This is a person who, in the Senate when debating the water efficiency labelling and standards amendment, said to Senator McKenzie, who was presiding at the time: “Madame Acting Deputy President McKenzie, you are looking wonderful tonight. You are a flash bit of kit in this chamber, there is no doubt about you.” And Senator McKenzie, objecting justifiably, says, “I mean, I’m sure there’s a standing order somewhere senator, but …”, and he said, “It is non-contro. Roll with me on this.” I mean, in her workplace! She is just trying to do her work, in her workplace! The Australian Senate! And Barnaby Joyce, our new deputy prime minister, thinks that is acceptable conduct. Australian women watching us here in this place, now feel that is what Scott Morrison considers acceptable conduct. I was in my electorate on the weekend in Stafford, and a woman was asking me: “As a woman, how do you go in this place? How does it feel when the prime minister turns his back on you whenever you stand up, or when Peter Dutton shuts you down three seconds after you start talking?” And I said: “What would you say if you had three seconds before the leader of the House shut you down, to give your message this government, what would you say?” And she said: “How do you people live with yourselves?” There was a lot going on yesterday, so you may have missed it – but the head of the vaccine rollout, Gen John Frewen, confirmed that there was no vaccine campaign because the government was worried about supply. Instead, the government is in the “rallying phase”. But there won’t be a campaign, until the government knows it can match demand with supply. Just something to keep in mind, given the government’s reluctance to admit there is an issue with that at the moment. The party room meetings are wrapping up – we’ll bring you what happened there very soon. It was the first joint party room meeting where Barnaby Joyce took lead as the Nationals leader. He’s having a function tonight to celebrate his swearing-in as deputy prime minister. Yesterday, NSW Health announced it had two new cases of Covid come in after 8pm – those cases will be included in today’s data. We’re still waiting on the official word, but you’ll find exposure sites here: South Australia has announced it will open its borders to residents from greater Melbourne – just in time for the school holidays. Libby Coker’s staff are across it: The latest Guardian Essential poll shows Australian voters are concerned the nation is being left behind on climate. As Murph reports: A majority of voters fear Australia will be left behind unless the Morrison government follows the lead of other countries in prioritising serious action to combat global heating, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The findings from the fortnightly survey of 1,087 respondents come as Barnaby Joyce deposed Michael McCormack and returned to lead the National party after a week where senior Nationals expressed open hostility about the government adopting a net zero emissions target by 2050. Scott Morrison says achieving net zero as soon as possible is Australia’s preference. Joyce was asked on Monday whether or not he would make fresh climate policy demands when he renegotiated the Coalition agreement with Morrison. The returning National party leader and deputy prime minister deflected. “I’ll be talking with my party room, about what they believe is best for them, and then fighting on that premise,” he said. I’m sure they all feel just great with the news Barnaby Joyce is back. That’ll make it allllllll better. Meanwhile, while the government is crowing about Australia’s strong economy, Grogs has taken a look at inequality. Spoiler – it’s growing New data from the bureau of statistics shows the drop in spending by households due to the pandemic increased the level of savings, but while incomes rose strongly for low-income households due to a big rise in social assistance, inequality remains worse than it was at the start of the century. Then there is this: Chris Bowen was asked about the argument that climate change is a global issue and Australia can’t be responsible for the rest of the world when he was on ABC radio this morning. (That was one of the points the reef envoy and local member Warren Entsch just made in that press conference as well.) Here is how Bowen answered it earlier today: That’s the tired, old trope we get from people who don’t believe in strong action on climate change from Australia – the world’s largest emitter per capita – that somehow every other country has an obligation here, but not us. But it’s not just about obligation. It’s also about the fact that the world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity. And under eight years of Liberal-National party government, we have not been embracing that opportunity and that is about to get a lot worse with the change that was made yesterday. Oh good, Bob Katter is now getting involved on the reef issue and in his media release announcing his press conference, makes a point of referencing the committee chair’s nationality. The government’s main argument against the Unesco draft decision to list the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger” seems to be: “we know climate change is the biggest threat to the reef, but we don’t believe that what Australia is doing (or not doing) on climate should count towards whether we are doing enough to protect the reef”. Sussan Ley: Now I know, and I know [the Liberal MP for Leichhardt] Warren [Entsch] knows, that climate change is the biggest threat to the reef and in no way am I stepping away from that recognition, and countries including European countries have got strong views about what policies different countries should have on climate change, and I understand that as well but this is not the convention in which to have those conversations. The correct place to have those conversations is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. So on the one hand we have actually got a draft decision that commends Australia for its sound and serious investment in the reef, but on the other hand points to the Paris targets and climate change and almost suggests that the world needs to do more. We know that we are punching above our weight when it comes to those targets an our commitment and Angus Taylor as energy minister has set that out very clearly. We are not “punching above our weight” on those targets, and we do not have a climate plan. There have been no locally acquired cases in Victoria again overnight. Hopefully that means it is looking good for the easing of restrictions: John Howard, an 81-year-old white man, who joined the Liberal party in the 1950s and worked as a politician for the majority of his life, having been elected to one of Sydney’s wealthiest electorates in 1974, doesn’t believe there is racism in Australia. This shouldn’t be news: Howard’s views that Australia was not a racist country shaped much of the nation’s social policy under his prime ministership, going so far as to reject the Eureka research anti-racism study his government commissioned in the late 1990s, because it found there was in fact, racism in Australia. This didn’t “align” with Howard’s views Australia wasn’t racist, so the report was suppressed until 2011. (Instead the government set up “Harmony Day”, which is essentially a day borne from the government’s desire to *not* confront racism.) Then there were the 2005 Cronulla race riots, which targeted the Middle Eastern community, in particular the Lebanese community, and had been spurred on by radio shock jocks such as Alan Jones, whose comments were found to have “likely to encourage violence or brutality and to vilify people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds on the basis of ethnicity”. Howard didn’t accept that was racist either and said at the time: I do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country. Overnight, Howard was a guest on the ABC special report Australia Talks – which went through the survey results of the ABC’s Australia Talks survey. Howard was there because he was voted Australia’s favourite prime minister (seriously). Co-host Nazeem Hussain (who had been listed on the TV guide as Waleed Aly, again, because – Australia) questioned Howard on his views on racism, given that 76% of respondents to the survey said they believed Australia had an issue with racism. Howard, though, still disagrees. That has not been my experience. I have to say, respectfully, to that 76%, say I don’t think there is underlying racism in Australia. Asked directly if he believed there was racism in Australia, Howard said, “No, I don’t.” And he still doesn’t believe the Cronulla riots had anything to do with race: My view about the Cronulla riots is that it was not an example of underlying racism. ... I think that is a supremely pessimistic view of the Australian community and I’ve seen so many examples of where people of different races have worked together in a seamless fashion for the common good. I think that’s a hugely pessimistic view of the Australian community. Which goes a long way to explaining why he is, apparently, Australia’s favourite prime minister. Because if a white, powerful man doesn’t see racism as an issue, because that hasn’t been his personal experience, then obviously there is no issue, right? May we present Australia’s government. (Thank Mike Bowers for this moment.) But if the Morrison government had given any indication it was serious about climate, by ... I don’t know, agreeing to net zero by 2050 (net zero also doesn’t mean zero emissions by the way), would Sussan Ley have to be having this conversation this morning? Does the environment minister agree that the world environment heritage committee probably was looking for something serious on climate from Australia? Ley: No, I don’t. The process has been flawed and I’m seeking to have that corrected, as is the foreign minister in our conversation. However, we expect, because we’ve seen the draft decision published overnight, that it will go forward to the committee meeting in July, and I will certainly be speaking to all of the members of the World Heritage Committee. So, the point is that this contravenes all previous approaches. Now, if Unesco wants to break faith with us and its own processes, that is very much a matter for them, but it is very much a matter for me to stand up for the people of the reef, for the farmers that have worked so hard to deliver the best quality catchments along the reef, and for the fact that it is a marine park managed, as I said, to the highest possibly standard. We are restoring ecosystems, working with traditional owners, we have world-leading science on coral restoration and I just want to make this point: the World Heritage Committee didn’t use the latest data, they did a desktop review. On all levels, I’m sorry, I’m giving them a big fail and I’m fighting for the reef. Sussan Ley says climate change should be seperate to conversations about environmental heritage sites like the Great Barrier Reef. She told the ABC: Absolutely not. This decision, as I said in the framework on the Unesco convention on world heritage properties, is about how an individual country manages its properties. Conversations about climate change – and I know the Europeans don’t agree with us in many instances – are correctly had in another forum. There are 20-something reefs on the world heritage property list, and this sends a very poor signal to all of those other reefs, none of whom can approach our level of management and investment, but to look to us for leadership ... so for us to be singled out is quite unreasonable. And here was Anthony Albanese on Sydney radio 2SM on Barnaby Joyce’s return: Well, everyone knows that this has always only been about Barnaby. It hasn’t been about the people of Australia. This is an act of self-indulgence at a time when we’re still dealing with the pandemic. Of course, the last time that Barnaby Joyce tried to seize the leadership of the National party was at the height of the bushfires. This is someone who is self-obsessed, who never has the national interest at the heart of what his actions are. And I think that showed yesterday. Yup. Labor, at least, seems thrilled that Barnaby Joyce is back in the deputy PM’s job, because it gives the party something tangible to fight. Here was Anthony Albanese on ABC TV this morning: Barnaby Joyce is a failed former deputy prime minister. He failed last time he had the job. We know how this movie ends because we’ve seen it. ... This is Barnaby Joyce The Sequel. We will continue to put forward our strong arguments for regional development. The fact is, if you talk about central Queensland, I’ve visited the Rio Tinto aluminium refinery there at Gladstone, one of the biggest employers in Gladstone, a critical facility. What Rio Tinto is looking at is powering that facility with solar energy. They are looking at lowering their prices, their costs of production by embracing renewables. That’s what’s happening on the ground. I was in Townsville last week. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced a major renewable energy precinct and supporting industries there. I’ve met with companies there that want to manufacture solar panels and manufacture renewable energy there that will create jobs, but the big opportunity there is how do we lower our energy prices in order to boost manufacturing in the regions? We lower our energy prices by embracing the lowest cost of energy. Sussan Ley will hold a press conference at 9am. The government is very, very worried about the Unesco draft decision to list the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger”. Well that was quick. It was almost like Anthony Albanese’s social team had this planned: It’s happened and is now official – Barnaby Joyce is Australia’s deputy prime minister. Sussan Ley, though, is very shocked: Chris Bowen, Labor’s environment spokesman, has spoken to ABC’s Radio National about the Unesco decision and says it really shouldn’t come as a shock: [The government] shouldn’t be surprised about the fact that the reef has encountered three bleaching events in the last five years and their complete response has been to gift almost half a billion dollars to an unaccountable charity. Graham Readfearn has looked at the Unesco decision: The Great Barrier Reef should be placed on to a list of world heritage sites “in danger”, according to a recommendation from United Nations officials that urges Australia to take “accelerated action at all possible levels” on climate change. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) says the world’s biggest coral reef system should be placed on the list at the World Heritage Committee meeting next month. The recommendation has sparked a flurry of activity from the Australian government, with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, saying she had already joined the foreign minister, Marise Payne, in a call to Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. Happy Tuesday. In just a few short hours, Barnaby Joyce will once again be your deputy prime minister. And he’s already renegotiating the Coalition agreement, which sets out what the Liberals and Nationals want from each other and can dictate decisions from ministries to government policy, but you won’t ever be allowed to see it. Good times! And given Joyce has spent the past three years on the backbench agitating for more coal, and his party just decided to vote him leader, you know what just got a lot more harder? Doing anything on climate! Just wonderful. Coincidentally Joyce officially becomes deputy prime minister on the day Unesco has ruled the Great Barrier Reef should be listed as “in danger” in a draft decision. Why? Because of the climate, mostly (and also farming run off). Sussan Ley, the environment minister, says the government was “blindsided” by the decision. (Which seems strange because I remember covering the warnings when I was still a reporter in Queensland and that was more than five years ago.) Queensland is also where the Nationals want to build a new coal-fired power station, so you can see where this is all going. The Great Barrier Reef is not only an environmental wonder that is critical for ocean health, it also supports a multi-billion-dollar industry and jobs for an entire region. So it being officially listed as “in danger” is an issue. We’ll bring you all of the fallout, as well as everything else happening today. Last night, NSW Health released new exposure sites – so the Sydney cluster is not over as yet. We’ll bring you those updates as well. Being a sitting day, you’ve got Amy Remeikis on the blog, with Mike Bowers. Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst here as well, and the entire Guardian brains trust at your disposal. This morning calls for cake for breakfast. Or something stronger. It’s going to be a loooong day. So let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-21T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","fields":{"headline":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","bodyText":"Combining solar power and microbes could produce 10 times more protein than crops such as soya beans, according to a new study. The system would also have very little impact on the environment, the researchers said, in stark contrast to livestock farming which results in huge amounts of climate-heating gases as well as water pollution. The concept uses electricity from solar panels and carbon dioxide from the air to create fuel for microbes, which are grown in bioreactor vats and then processed into dry protein powders. The process makes highly efficient use of land, water and fertiliser and could be deployed anywhere, not just in countries with strong sunshine or fertile soils, the scientists said. Food security is a “critical issue” for humanity in coming decades, they said, with the global population growing, biofuels competing for land with crops, and about 800 million people already undernourished today. Furthermore, tackling the climate crisis will be near impossible without slashing emissions from animal and dairy food production. Microbes are already used to make many common foods, such as bread, yoghurt, beer and Quorn. But other researchers said converting consumers to eating microbial protein might be difficult and that such foods may not be nutritionally complete. Dorian Leger, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, Germany, who led the new analysis, said: “We think microbial foods are very promising and will be one of the major contributors to solving the potential food crisis. “It might pick up quite quickly on the consumer side, but it’s hard to say. “But I do some exercise, and if I was offered a bacterial protein shake now, I would have it.” The team focused on soya beans, as these are linked to the destruction of forests and are mostly fed to animals, but other bacteria produce the main elements of palm oil. “Bacteria are very flexible, so they could eventually be tuned to different products,” Leger said. At least a dozen companies are already producing animal feed from microbes but the bacteria are typically fed either sugars from other crops or methane or methanol from fossil fuels. Solar Foods, based in Finland, is using electricity to create food for humans. The new assessment, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, is the first quantitative comparison of land use and energy efficiency between traditional agriculture and solar-powered microbial production systems. The researchers used data on today’s technologies to calculate the efficiency of each step of the process, including capturing CO2 from the air and processing the microbes into food that people could eat. They found the microbial system used just 1% of the water needed by the crops and a small fraction of the fertiliser, most of which is wasted when used in fields. The analysis estimated that the solar-microbial process could produce 15 tonnes of protein from each hectare (or per 2.5 acres) a year, enough to feed 520 people, which the scientists said was a conservative estimate. In comparison, a hectare of soya beans could produce 1.1 tonnes of protein, feeding 40 people. Even in countries with relatively low sunlight levels like the UK, microbial protein production was at least five times greater from each hectare than plants. The microbial protein would cost about the same as current proteins eaten by people, such as whey or pea, the researchers suggested. But it was several times more expensive than current animal feeds, although future technological improvements are expected to lower costs. Leger said plants’ ability to photosynthesise is remarkable but, in terms of energy efficiency, staple crops only convert about 1% of solar energy into edible biomass. This is because plants have evolved to compete and reproduce as well as just grow, and use less of the solar light spectrum than photovoltaic panels. All the components of the system exist, but Leger said they now need to be tested together and at scale, in particular the capturing of CO2 from the air and ensuring that used solar panels can be recycled. “For human food, there’s also a lot of regulation that needs to be overcome,” he said. Pete Iannetta, at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, said: ““It’s a really interesting concept – you are divorcing food production from land use, which would mean you could have all that land available for rewilding.” But he said food is not only composed of the main nutrients, like protein and carbohydrate: “There are an awful lot of secondary compounds that are important for your wellbeing.” Iannetta also questioned whether microbial foods would become mainstream: “For example, we have used algae for a long time as a potential food resource, but it’s still not widely accepted.” Dr Toby Mottram, a consultant on agricultural technology, said: “Until the model is tested and costed with a pilot-scale plant, including a lifecycle assessment of [solar panel] production, it is hard to comment on whether it improves on [farming] systems which have been sustained for thousands of years, albeit for a lower population than we are planning to feed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-18T12:49:00Z","webTitle":"Donors say they won’t support University of Newcastle after coalmining executive made chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Donors say they won’t support University of Newcastle after coalmining executive made chancellor","bodyText":"Prominent philanthropists have said they will not donate to the University of Newcastle after coalmining executive Mark Vaile was appointed the institution’s new chancellor. Vaile, a former federal Nationals leader and the current chairman of Whitehaven Coal, was named the university’s new chancellor earlier this month, a decision that prompted a member of the university council to resign. In a sign of further backlash, 16 philanthropists wrote in an open letter published on Friday that they would not support the university given Vaile’s appointment. “It is of course up to the council of the University of Newcastle to decide who should lead them,” the letter, published in the Newcastle Herald, said. “But it up to us to decide which universities we will support. As significant donors we write this letter to make clear to the university, that we, and many like-minded others, will not support a university who would choose as their leader someone who is determined to build new coalmines when most of the world is determined to reduce fossil fuel use.” Among the signatories were entrepreneurs Alan Schwartz and Graeme Wood, the former Australian rugby captain, David Pocock, and philanthropist Sue McKinnon. They noted that Whitehaven Coal was seeking to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales. The proposal was the subject of a recent landmark federal court judgment that found the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis. The letter follows a decision by Prof Jennifer Martin, from the school of medicine, to quit the university council in protest, while the University of Newcastle Students’ Association has also called on the university to reconsider. In response to the criticism, Vaile acknowledged in an op-ed for the Newcastle Herald that there had been “questions, of course, about how my background does or doesn’t fit with what the university and our region needs”. He said he was “excited” to be able to help the university deliver on its “commitment to become carbon neutral by 2025”. “While people often hear about my experience in Australia’s well-established industries in the energy sector, including Whitehaven Coal, they may not be as familiar with other areas of my portfolio,” Vaile said. “For example, I am the chair of Palisade Investment Partners – an organisation that has $1bn of assets under management in wind and solar energy technologies. “I strongly believe that if we are to address the challenges of human-made climate change, we must help our industries and our communities to transition our energy sector – there is no place in this country where this challenge is more important than in the Hunter.” Vaile said it could not be an “ideological debate of coal versus renewables”. His critics, writing in their open letter, pointed to the university’s motto “I look ahead” and said his appointment “speaks volumes”. “Mr Vaile has played an important role in Australian politics and business, but that role has included questioning the science of climate change and its links to drought, and leading companies that are determined to build new coal mines,” they wrote. Vaile was the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister from 2005 to 2007 and has been chairman of Whitehaven Coal since 2012. The ABC reported Vaile as saying he believed his role as Whitehaven chairman and his post at the university were “not mutually exclusive”. He said he would not attempt to change the strategic direction of the university and was committed to its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2025. Approached for comment by Guardian Australia, the university pointed to Vaile’s op-ed published by the Newcastle Herald this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-17T15:28:54Z","webTitle":"Californians and Texans urged to conserve energy as temperatures soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","fields":{"headline":"Californians and Texans urged to conserve energy as temperatures soar","bodyText":"California and Texas urged residents to conserve energy to reduce stress on the grid and avoid outages as homes and businesses crank up air conditioners to escape a scorching heatwave blanketing the US south-west. High temperatures were expected to top 110F (43C) through the weekend in parts of several states including California, Arizona and Nevada. “The public’s help is essential when extreme weather or other factors beyond our control put undue stress on the electric grid,” said Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California ISO, which operates the grid in most of California. Summer-like heat arrived with spring still on the calendar as a dome of high pressure covered the west. Oppressive daytime highs have been followed by extremely warm nights. Palm Springs hit a record 120F on Tuesday, four degrees above the old 15 June record set in 1961. A coastal eddy swirling low clouds over southern California brought enough cooling Wednesday for forecasters to reduce some excessive-heat warnings to advisories around the Los Angeles region. But warnings were going into effect in the Central Valley, where some locations could see highs up to 113F. Over the past year, Texas and California have imposed rotating or controlled outages to prevent more widespread collapses of their power systems – California during a heatwave in August 2020 and Texas during a brutal freeze in February 2021. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), the state’s grid operator, expects Thursday’s demand to break the June record set on Monday. In February, Ercot imposed rotating outages as extreme cold froze natural gas pipes and wind turbines, leaving millions of customers without power – some for days. Ercot has been under fire for the design of its system, which is not connected to other US grids to avoid federal oversight, and because they do not operate a “capacity” market that keeps power generation on standby during extreme weather events. The California ISO said its flex alert, or call for conservation, “is critical because when temperatures hit triple digits across a wide geographic area, no state has enough energy to meet all the heightened demand”. It asks Californians to set thermostats to 78F or higher, turn off unnecessary lights and avoid use of major appliances from 5pm to 10pm on Thursday. The ISO said evening is the most difficult time of day because demand remains high but solar energy diminishes. So far this year, solar has provided 22% of the grid’s power. Mainzer, the California CEO, said the grid was stable and there was no expectation of rotating power outages, but that could change as temperatures spike in the coming days. “The current forecast for shortages are relatively modest in magnitude and we think there’s a good chance that we’ll be able to resolve them across the course of the day tomorrow,” he told reporters on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T11:54:37Z","webTitle":"Flower power: how one company is beautifying the wind turbine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","fields":{"headline":"Flower power: how one company is beautifying the wind turbine","bodyText":"Tulips and flowers could help harness the power of the wind, after a green energy company came up with its own spin on wind power in an “eco-art” design. Flower Turbines, based in the US and the Netherlands, has installations across Rotterdam, Amsterdam, parts of Germany, Israel and Colombia. The company aims to democratise green energy for everyone and make small windfarms a leading player in the green energy industry. The turbines pose no danger to birds and other wildlife, particularly in urban settings, the company claims, and they create noise at a low frequency undetectable to humans. Opponents of windfarms often cite noise concerns along with aesthetic complaints. Dr Daniel Farb, the CEO of Flower Turbines, hopes to have solved this problem with an “eco-art” design. “Big turbines are very efficient, but for some people they’re an eyesore,” he said. “They definitely produce noise, flicker and some degree of environmental degradation. I was looking for a way to solve these problems, to make wind energy available for everybody. “I felt that there had to be a missing solution that would work for the combination of houses, large buildings, the environment – close to people. In other words, how could you make something that could be quiet but also efficient?” The company has also looked into expanding into e-mobility, creating wind- and solar-powered electric bicycle charging stations. Roy Osinga, the European director of Flower Turbines, said: “Our product – compared to big windmills – is silent, and good-looking, which makes it very successful for building in cities, because nobody wants to live next to a turbine which is up to 200 metres high making a lot of noise. “Solar power doesn’t perform that well at night, or during the winter. The turbines that we are delivering are a good match with solar energy, because wind and solar have natural opposite panel patterns when they produce energy. “We are not a competitor or an alternative for the big energy companies. We are a solution provider for companies and corporates that really want to pivot their business towards sustainability.” Quirky wind turbines have been at the forefront of wind power. Vortex Bladeless, a turbine that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades synonymous with wind power, went viral on Reddit in March where the turbine was likened to a giant vibrating sex toy, or “skybrator”. Another company, Alpha 311, which began in a garden shed in Whitstable, Kent, has begun manufacturing a small vertical wind turbine that it claims can generate electricity without wind. Europe is working towards becoming climate-neutral by 2050, after member states and the UK parliament agreed on the necessary targets ahead of a virtual climate summit hosted by Joe Biden. In the UK, most of the offshore workforce, including in wind power, could be involved in delivering low-carbon energy by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-01T17:11:27Z","webTitle":"BP buys string of US solar farms for £155m in clean energy drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","fields":{"headline":"BP buys string of US solar farms for £155m in clean energy drive","bodyText":"BP has bought a pipeline of US solar farms, capable of powering more than 1.7m homes, for more than $220m (£155m) as part of its plan to distance itself from the fossil fuel industry. The oil company has agreed to snap up a string of development projects, totalling 9GW, from the independent US solar developer 7X Energy in a “significant step” towards its goal of securing 20GW by 2025. The projects will be developed by the UK solar company Lightsource BP across 12 states in the US, which is one of the world’s fastest growing solar energy markets and is expected to double in the next five years and quadruple over the next decade. Lightsource BP, the British solar startup which formed a 50:50 joint venture with BP in 2017, broke into its second new market in a week on Tuesday after snapping up 40% of the capacity awarded in a Greek government renewables auction alongside the Greek energy firm Kiefer TEK. The award emerged days after it entered the Portugese solar energy market for the first time. Dev Sanyal, BP’s head of gas and low-carbon energy, said the US deal was “a significant step as we continue to deliver on our net zero ambition” by growing the renewable energy business “in a deliberate and disciplined way”. BP aims to establish a pipeline of renewable energy projects totalling 20GW by 2025 and 50GW by the end of the decade, while slowly reducing its production of fossil fuels to transform from an oil company into a clean energy business. The group also used the US market for its first significant step into the offshore wind market after agreeing last year to pay $1.1bn (£850m) for a stake in two US offshore wind projects being developed by the Norwegian state oil company, Equinor. Only a few months later BP and its partner, the Germany utility EnBW, struck a deal to pay the crown estate a record-breaking £462m-a-year to lease the seabed for two offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea capable of powering more than 3.4m UK households. “This is an integrated energy company in action,” Sanyal said. “This will bring together the best of BP to create value and provide customers with what they want – clean, affordable, energy.” The company has faced criticism from some investors who believe the company is paying too much to accelerate its move into clean energy. BP’s plans, under the chief executive, Bernard Looney, are some of the most ambitious put forward by a big oil company, and even won cautious praise from green groups including Greenpeace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T08:51:07Z","webTitle":"Oman plans to build world’s largest green hydrogen plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","fields":{"headline":"Oman plans to build world’s largest green hydrogen plant","bodyText":"Oman is planning to build one of the largest green hydrogen plants in the world in a move to make the oil-producing nation a leader in renewable energy technology. Construction is scheduled to start in 2028 in Al Wusta governorate on the Arabian Sea. It will be built in stages, with the aim to be at full capacity by 2038, powered by 25 gigawatts of wind and solar energy. The consortium of companies behind the $30bn (£21bn) project includes the state-owned oil and gas company OQ, the Hong Kong-based renewable hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy and the Kuwait-based energy investor Enertech. Once online, the plant will use renewable energy to split water in an electrolyser to produce green hydrogen, which is able to replace fossil fuels without producing carbon emissions. Most will be exported to Europe and Asia, said Alicia Eastman, the co-founder and president of InterContinental Energy, either as hydrogen or converted into green ammonia, which is easier to ship and store. The facility aims to produce 1.8m tonnes of green hydrogen and up to 10m tonnes of green ammonia a year. Oman currently relies heavily on fossil fuels, generating up to 85% of its GDP from oil and gas, but its fossil fuel reserves are dwindling and becoming increasingly costly to extract. In December 2020, the country published its Oman Vision 2040 strategy, a plan to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and increase investment in renewables. Green hydrogen could play an important role, said Eastman, thanks to the Oman’s combination of plentiful daytime sun and strong winds at night. “Oman is one of the places in the world that I’ve called the ‘future renewable superpowers’,” said Michael Liebreich, the founder of BloombergNEF, “because what you really want [to produce green hydrogen] is very cheap solar and very cheap wind.” While electrification is the most efficient way of decarbonising most sectors, it’s limited when it comes to energy-intensive industries such as steel, chemicals, aviation and shipping. Green hydrogen will be vital to help fill these gaps, said the International Energy Agency in its report published this week, which called for an end to fossil fuel investments if governments are serious about climate commitments. A wave of net zero-emissions pledges has already led to a slew of hydrogen strategies, including from the European Commission in 2020, which predicted the share of hydrogen in the EU’s energy mix would rise from 2% to 14% by 2050. Yet green hydrogen currently makes up less than 1% of global hydrogen production. The majority is still produced using fossil fuels such as gas and coal, in a process that emits about 830m tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined. “Blue hydrogen” is a cleaner version, as emissions are captured and stored, but it is still produced using gas – and is seen by some oil companies as a way to keep using fossil fuels. One of the stumbling blocks for green hydrogen has been cost, partly because of the huge amounts of energy required. But as renewables and electrolysers become cheaper, and fossil fuel prices rise, costs could fall by up to 64% by 2030, according to research from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Most green hydrogen products will not be competitive for at least another decade,” said Falko Ueckerdt, a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who sees the Oman project as “a sign that investors anticipate large future demands for hydrogen-based fuels after 2030”. Oman’s proposed plant is just one in a slate of green hydrogen mega projects planned globally. Eastman said InterContinental Energy has a number of other plants in the works, including a 26GW wind and solar green hydrogen plant in the Pilbara, Western Australia. If constructed, this $36bn (£25.5bn) plant would be the world’s biggest energy project. The first phase is expected to be online by 2028. In March, the renewables company Enegix Energy announced the construction of a green hydrogen plan in Ceará state, north-eastern Brazil. Once built, which the company estimates will take about four years, the plant would produce more than 600,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 3.4GW of wind and solar power. “People are upping the gigawatts, and they should,” said Eastman, “there’s so much room in the market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/17/australias-first-fully-renewable-hydrogen-valley-slated-for-nsw-coal-heartland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-17T05:40:04Z","webTitle":"Australia’s first fully renewable ‘hydrogen valley’ slated for NSW","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/17/australias-first-fully-renewable-hydrogen-valley-slated-for-nsw-coal-heartland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/17/australias-first-fully-renewable-hydrogen-valley-slated-for-nsw-coal-heartland","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s first fully renewable ‘hydrogen valley’ slated for NSW coal heartland","bodyText":"Australia’s first “hydrogen valley” would be created in New South Wales and run entirely on renewable energy under a $2bn proposal supported by local and global energy companies. Led by renewables advisory business Energy Estate, the consortium says it plans to produce green hydrogen with wind and solar energy and use it as a feedstock for mining, transport and industrial users in the upper Hunter Valley, spruiking it as a potential replacement for the region’s coal industry. If successful, a second stage would pipe hydrogen to Newcastle, where it could be used to help run a clean energy industrial precinct. Vincent Dwyer, a principal at Energy Estate, said it could provide zero-emissions feedstock for chemical manufacturing and allow the development of green ammonia for export. Companies said to be looking at getting involved in the Hunter hydrogen network include AGL Energy, pipeline operator APA Group, Idemitsu (the Japanese owner of a Muswellbrook coalmine), commodities trader Trafigura and renewable energy developers RES Australia and Walcha Energy. “We’re not wanting to own all of these opportunities,” Dwyer said. “We’re wanting to enable them to occur by building the backbone infrastructure and then partner with people.” The proposal announcement follows the Morrison government’s budget commitment of $275m over five years to help develop five hydrogen “hubs” in regional areas. The government’s pledge is to support “clean” hydrogen, which could include “green” hydrogen made with renewable energy and “blue” hydrogen fossil fuels backed by carbon capture and storage. The government was expected to announce funding for the hubs next year, with potential sites including the Hunter Valley, Tasmania’s Bell Bay, the Pilbara region in Western Australia, Gladstone in Queensland, Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and Darwin. Its goal is to help reduce the cost of producing hydrogen to $2 a kilogram. Dwyer said Energy Estate was yet to discuss its proposal with the government. He said it would not be looking for public backing “for the cost of the electrons”, but hoped to discuss “how to plan the infrastructure to allow the hydrogen to occur”. “The federal government is after good ideas and we’re hoping it would get behind it,” he said. Green hydrogen is created by using an electrolyser to run an electrical current through water, separating it into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can also be made using gas through a different process that releases carbon dioxide. Under the government’s proposal, it would need to be captured and either used or pumped underground. An analysis by BloombergNEF last year suggested green hydrogen could become the cheapest form of fuel much faster than expected, citing evidence of Chinese manufacturers already using electrolysers that cost about 80% less than estimates released by CSIRO in 2018. The Hunter Valley proposal would involve green hydrogen being produced on the site of a repurposed coalmine at Muswellbrook by 2024 and piped to near the Liddell coal plant, which is to close in 2023. Under the second stage, more electrolysers would be installed near Liddell between 2022 and 2026, and an additional hydrogen pipeline would run from there to Newcastle, allowing development of a clean energy precinct near the port. The operation would be powered by solar and wind farms backed by batteries in a renewable energy zone on the Walcha plateau. New electricity transmission lines would be needed to connect the zone with a substation at Liddell. Under a possible third stage, another hydrogen pipeline could be built to the central west and New England renewable energy zones, which are to be developed under legislation that passed the NSW parliament last year. Hannah McCaughey, an executive with APA, said the company was excited to be part of projects that could “support a lower carbon future and potentially unlock Australia’s unrivalled advantages in hydrogen”. There have been varying estimates of the role that hydrogen is likely to play in replacing fossil fuels. It is hoped it could become an affordable emissions-free alternative to fossil fuels in industries that operate at incredibly high temperatures and in some large-scale transport, in particular. The Australian government has named “clean” hydrogen one of five “low-emissions” technology priorities and estimated it could create more than 8,000 jobs and generate about $11bn a year in GDP by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-13T18:31:24Z","webTitle":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","fields":{"headline":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","bodyText":"Elon Musk moves in mysterious ways, so it would be foolish to assume that his new sceptical stance on bitcoin will last longer than his previous cheerleading. But he has now landed on the right spot: bitcoin is an environmental abomination. Researchers at the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance have been chronicling as much for ages. At last count, electronic mining of the cryptocurrency was consuming the same quantity of energy as economies the size of Argentina or the Netherlands. That matters because the super-computers in China, the ones doing the bulk of the mining, are running mostly on electricity generated by coal – the point referenced by Musk. The crypto crew will counter that gold and other “stores of value” (their description-cum-hope) aren’t squeaky-clean either. True, but the difference with bitcoin is that the puzzle-solving method of discovery makes the energy consumption more intense over time. And the plea in some quarters that the computers’ vast appetites will boost the advance of low-cost solar energy is, to put it mildly, elaborate. In the here and now, bitcoin mining is a dirty business. True believers weren’t happy about Musk’s U-turn but Tesla’s shareholders ought to be delighted. The founder’s talent for publicity has saved the company a fortune in advertising, but there were clear dangers in tying his personal brand, and Tesla’s, to a single cryptocurrency. A plunge in the price of the coins would not help his popularity. Being seen to step off the rollercoaster when the price is 25% off its highs but, critically, up massively over 12 months, may prove smart timing. More importantly, dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas just don’t sit well together. That was also true in February, of course, when Tesla was a buyer of $1.5bn-worth and said it would accept payment in the tokens. Don’t expect Musk or the board to explain the about-turn, but it may be a belated recognition that bitcoin’s dire environmental record was a business risk too far for Tesla. Maverick geniuses can get away with a lot, but hypocrisy tends to take a toll in the end. All BT needs to do now is to dig BT had to be cajoled and threatened over many years, but it is finally in a defensible position on fast-fibre broadband rollout. The company will aim to reach 25m premises by the end of 2026, an upgrade on the previous promise of 20m by the mid-to-late part of this decade. The City, in its dull way, preferred to concentrate on the short-term hit to cashflows, the consequence of investing more money sooner. The shares fell 6%. Investors ought to count their blessings. BT has secured its “fair bet” on financial returns – the cause of all the wrangling – and has been gifted “super deductions” on infrastructure spending for two years. Meanwhile, the last lot of 5G licences were secured at lower-than-expected prices. The dividend is back at 7.7p a share. Even the pension fund has become slightly less heavy. The financial cherry would be joint-venture deals with infrastructure investors to fund the rollout to 5m of the 25m premises, but the chief executive, Philip Jansen, is adamant that BT can take the solo route if necessary. When the trenches have been dug and filled, BT should account for somewhere between one half and two-thirds of the UK’s fast-fibre network. The rejigged plan has tilted the odds towards the higher figure, which is surely a good thing for investors. One wonders how the directors, reportedly, find so much to quarrel over. The outlook looks clear for the next half-decade. Just dig. James Anderson’s Amazon tease is intriguing James Anderson, one of the world’s best technology investors, signed off his last set of figures as co-manager of the £15bn Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust by taking a pop at all favourite targets: the “irretrievably broken” fund management industry, media doom-mongers, and more. He’s right on all his main points, of course. The investment game changed when it became possible for companies to grow their revenues at a compound rate of 41% for over two decades, as Amazon has done. It is amazing that Scottish Mortgage’s success has not spawned more fund imitators that hunt for such “extreme upside” opportunities. But there was also a tease on Amazon as Jeff Bezos steps down as chief executive. “Amazon is now seen as good value, safe and acceptable. It no longer has a founder CEO. We fear that in his inimitable terms it is no longer Day 1 in Seattle.” From an investor who knows Bezos’s creation inside out, that’s intriguing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-13T11:00:27Z","webTitle":"Solar pushback: how US power firms try to make people pay for going green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","fields":{"headline":"Solar pushback: how US power firms try to make people pay for going green","bodyText":"Kevin Good is the president of a small solar power company in Kansas – a state that tends to be so sunny you’d think he’d have it made. “I got into solar at maybe the worst point to do so in the last 50 years,” said Good, who runs Good Energy Solutions in Lawrence, a town of about 100,000. Kansas has about as much solar potential as Florida but lags far behind the state, powering only about 12,000 homes – or less than 2% of what is covered in Florida, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. That could be related to an ongoing debate in the states that is pitting utilities companies against solar energy. The Kansas utility Evergy has vastly expanded wind power in the state, but it is advocating for policies that would make customers less likely to install rooftop solar panels. That’s because if customers generate their own power, they won’t need to buy as much from Evergy. The fight has played out in state after state, from Arizona to California to Massachusetts – as power companies are threatened by the transition. In 2018, Evergy got permission from state regulators to collect fees from rooftop solar users, but Kansas’s highest court recently ruled that illegal. So, Evergy went back to regulators and asked them to approve different charges – a grid access charge and a minimum monthly bill. The regulators, at the Kansas Corporation Commission, rejected both proposals. They have told the company to work with solar advocates on a more holistic compromise. Andrew French, the chair of the commission, said in February that his state isn’t the only one in a standoff surrounding solar, particularly about how to rework a policy called net metering – where customers are compensated for power they send back to the grid. “This is not an issue unique to Kansas,” French said. “Others have implemented net metering 2.0 and beyond. I hope we will look at new models to try to figure out the appropriate way to value these resources.” Rick Gillam, a program director with the national solar advocacy group Vote Solar, said that Evergy is like most utilities in opposing customers reducing their usage of utility-supplied electricity. “Its general animosity has created uncertainty for solar developers and customers alike,” he said. Utilities have for years battled against net metering. Now, they are also turning to other billing strategies to try to recoup the money they fear they will lose when their customers aren’t as reliant on them. States around the country are reconsidering how they compensate customers who have their own rooftop solar. A lawyer for the trade group for investor-owned utilities, Emily Fisher of the Edison Electric Institute, said at a regulatory conference earlier this year that utilities in 2020 installed 12 gigawatts of solar power and in 2021 are on track for even more. But the pandemic left many customers unable to pay their bills, shifting costs on to others, she said. “We have to be really mindful of costs as we continue to drive toward clean,” Fisher said. ** Power companies have worried about a future like they see in California, which is far ahead of other states on rooftop solar and is considering overhauling electricity rules to try to boost adoption further. Environmental advocates say that amid the green energy revolution that the Biden administration is touting and climate scientists are calling for, utilities are standing in the way. “It’s the wave of the future. Customer tastes are becoming green, they are becoming organic in what they eat and what they wear,” said Ahmad Faruqui, an industry expert with the consulting firm The Brattle Group. “Why should electricity be any different?” The debate in Kansas specifically is not about whether climate change is happening and renewable power is necessary – but about how to shift the landscape to accommodate green energy despite pushback from powerful corporations. Climate change deniers are increasingly out of place in the state, which has seen a significant economic boost from wind power. Kansas’s governor, Laura Kelly, is a Democrat, although the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. Kelly supports renewable power, especially wind. One relatively new state senator, Mike Thompson, has attempted to propose anti-wind power legislation that one Kansas non-profit group has deemed among the “most restrictive”, in the US. Thompson – a former meteorologist who has received campaign donations from both the fossil-fuel invested Koch brothers and a Pac for Evergy – denies the science that shows humans are heating the planet at an unsustainable rate. In a sign of the times, his fellow Republicans shot down his proposal, and it is unlikely to move forward. Thompson and Evergy represent two sides of the opposition that stands to curb renewable power growth around the country. Thompson’s complaints are ideological. He falsely argues the public “has been subjected to a constant barrage of falsified, exaggerated and alarming claims”, about climate change. He and other conservatives around the country have sought to cast renewables as unreliable and expensive. Evergy, on the other hand, says it’s committed to reducing its climate pollution and has massively grown its wind power, displacing some coal-fired energy. Evergy’s power mix is 39% coal, 27% wind, 26% fossil gas, 7% nuclear and 1% solar and other renewable power. Evergy’s senior vice-president, Chuck Caisley, said environmental advocates are unfairly painting the company as anti-renewables and that he just wants rooftop solar generators to help pay for the grid they use. Utility companies argue that when customers opt out, they will be forced to charge the remaining pool of users more. “From an issue of fundamental fairness, we just don’t believe that because you put a solar array on your house, [your neighbor should] have to pay more,” he said. “It was never our intention to try and hurt the solar industry.” But utilities remain monopolies, meaning their customers typically don’t have other options. They are typically regulated by elected or appointed state officials, who determine how big of a profit they can make from running plants and power lines. Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Kansas-based Climate + Energy Project, said those profit motivations have stalled progress for years. “We could have worked together to find common ground and could have been so far ahead on solar,” Barnett said. “There were so many opportunities along the way that were missed because Kansas utilities were slow to recognize we are in a period of transition with our electric system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-09T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"A valiant campaign on care homes, but the pain goes on | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","fields":{"headline":"Letters: a valiant campaign on care homes, but the pain goes on","bodyText":"Nicci Gerrard, through her writings in this newspaper and lead role in John’s Campaign, has done more than just effect yet another government U-turn (“Why did the government take so long to back down on this care home cruelty?”, Comment). She highlighted the patchwork of care homes covering more than 450,000 residents and their loved ones and how they had become “jails of enforced loneliness”, where Covid was not the only killer. That jolted me into connecting with other patient carers to channel and help assuage the pain of suffering in isolation, hitherto without mutual support and always in dread of that final telephone call. I have great admiration for Nicci and her dogged determination to prove that “our campaign is not over” but her conclusion that “bereft families can finally open the door to step out together into the world” is tragically not the case for bereaved families like mine, who will have to live the pain of “unredeemable time” after receiving that call when I lost my darling wife in a prison of enforced loneliness. Ron Noon Allerton, Liverpool A once proud name I grew up the proud bearer of a singular, immediately recognised surname, origins obscure, within a family known for its professional service and solid reputation for quiet decency and hard work. There are no more male heirs left on our side, nor, I believe, within the older branch of the family. How sad, then, to see the legacy being left by the last male of the family as portrayed by the richly accurate pen of Chris Riddell (“The emperor’s new curtains”, Comment). My forebears would be turning in their graves. Wendy Jenrick Sheffield Shameful inaction on fraud In the face of more than 3m incidents of financial fraud a year worth at least £2.8bn, the government’s response to Martin Lewis that it is “really difficult” to regulate the likes of Facebook and Google is reprehensible (“There’s an epidemic of scams, but fraudsters are getting off scot-free, says Martin Lewis”, News). Furthermore, its preference to instead rely on Lewis’s £3m court victory, a minuscule blip on the revenues of the internet behemoths, did nothing to recompense victims. How much longer are we expected to accept government inaction and disregard for the rights of its citizens? Neil Macehiter Great Shelford, Cambridge Cakes and Port Vale Rachel Cooke’s dilemma of how to warm oatcakes is easily solved (“Let them eat oatcakes”, Notebook, Comment). Simply lay the oatcake on the grill pan, add thinly sliced or grated cheese (traditionally cheshire but cheddar will do) and grill until bubbling. Roll up and eat! Add extra fillings – brown sauce, bacon, sausage, mushroom if you must. Oatcakes are our traditional foodstuff – product of local agriculture and the traditional bottle kilns that fired the potbanks of Stoke-on-Trent. For those who don’t have a Neal’s Yard Dairy on their doorstep, you can always use mail order, visit Stoke on Trent’s oatcake shops, or make your own from ready-made packs available from Port Vale football club’s shop. That way, you would be savouring a local delicacy as well as backing a football club whose owners, supporters and foundation value loyalty above all else. Joan Walley Stoke-on-Trent Transgender fears I wanted to say how much I valued the interview with Dr David Bell (“What matters is the truth. I hate the fact that the fear of being seen to be transphobic now overrides everything”, the New Review). It is worrying that the Tavistock sought to suppress the (in my view) very reasonably questioning position of Dr Bell with respect to the potentially irreversible treatments being carried out on children and adolescents. The subsequent judgment of the high court in the case of Keira Bell v the Tavistock and now the recent decision of Sweden to halt the use of puberty blockers in children (except as part of research trials) bears this out. More and more clinicians are becoming extremely concerned at the practice of increasingly treating psychological distress about one’s body and gender with potentially irreversible medical and surgical treatments. Dr Ellen Wright London SE10 Not more solar energy Will Hutton writes about the potential impact of space-based technologies on our lives, including plans to beam solar energy from giant mirrors in space to the Earth’s surface (“Fifty years after Apollo, space is about to transform our life on Earth beyond recognition”, Comment). Climate change is happening because rising CO2 levels trap heat in the atmosphere instead of allowing it to radiate into space. Pouring yet more energy into the system will only result in yet more heating. We already receive plenty of solar energy from space; we just need to make better use of it. Chris Webster Gümligen, Switzerland Unfair payment after death Anna Tims’s report resonated with me following the sad death of my mother in November last year (“Grieving relatives tell of despair at months of waiting for probate”, Cash). As executor, I appointed a solicitor to manage probate of my mother’s estate. There is substantial inheritance tax (IHT), which I do not object to but cannot afford to pay so will need to liquidate assets from the estate once I have been granted probate. HMRC has agreed to wait for the IHT to be paid up to 28 days after the issue of the grant of probate. There appears to have been no progress made by the relevant probate registry since January. HMRC has confirmed that interest on the IHT will still accrue from 31 May, six months from the date of death. A “financial fine” for an inadequate government system seems ludicrous, stressful and an unfair burden on grieving beneficiaries. My mother would be horrified if she knew that her family were struggling to benefit from her carefully managed estate. John Tungatt Bromley, London Ted Hastings is right Kenan Malik writes of crony capitalism and the unregulated market being central to the Grenfell tragedy (“Grenfell is still giving up its secrets and they retain the power to shock”, Comment). Nick Cohen writes on rampant cronyism/sleaze in central government and the lack of regulation in public life (“If public life goes unregulated, just who will hold politicians to account?”, Comment). Despite all this, Boris Johnson still heads the polls. The final words of superintendent Ted Hastings, Britain’s favourite cop, come to mind: “What’s happened to us?

Fuels produced from hydrogen can be used as straight replacements for oil and gas and can be low-carbon, if renewable electricity is used to produce these “e-fuels”. However, the research found that using the electricity directly to power cars and warm houses was far more efficient. The analysis estimated that hydrogen-based fuels would be very expensive and scarce in the coming decade. Therefore, equipment such as “hydrogen-ready” boilers could end up reliant on fossil gas and continue to produce the carbon emissions driving global heating. However, a few sectors such as aviation, shipping, steel and some chemicals are extremely hard to electrify. The researchers said hydrogen-based fuels would be needed for these by 2050, when the world needs to have reached net zero emissions. But they said enormous investment in technology and fast-rising carbon taxes would be needed to achieve this. Renewable electricity production is increasing rapidly as costs tumble. But it still makes up a small proportion of all energy used, which is mostly provided by coal, oil and gas. Using the electricity directly is efficient, but requires investment in new types of car and heating systems. Using the electricity to create hydrogen from water and then using carbon dioxide to manufacture other fuels can produce “drop-in” replacements for fossil fuels. But the new study concludes this cannot work on a large enough scale to tackle the climate emergency in time. “Hydrogen-based fuels can be a great clean energy carrier, yet their costs and associated risks are also great,” said Falko Ueckerdt, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, who led the research. “If we cling to combustion technologies and hope to feed them with hydrogen-based fuels, and these turn out to be too costly and scarce, then we will end up burning further oil and gas,” he said. “We should therefore prioritise those precious hydrogen-based fuels for applications for which they are indispensable: long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production and steel production.” Prof Gunnar Luderer, also at PIK and part of the study team, said: “As climate targets require immediate emission reductions, direct electrification should come first to assure a safe future. It is clear that the contribution of e-fuels and hydrogen will be marginal on the timescale of 2030.” The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, calculated that producing and burning hydrogen-based fuels in home gas boilers required six to 14 times more electricity than heat pumps providing the same warmth. This is because energy is wasted in creating the hydrogen, then the e-fuel, then in burning it. For cars, using e-fuels requires five times more electricity than is needed than for battery-powered cars. Romain Sacchi, from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and part of the study team, said: “We are currently far from 100% renewable electricity. If produced with the current electricity mixes [in Europe], hydrogen-based fuels would increase – not decrease – greenhouse gas emissions, [compared with] using fossil fuels.” Daryl Wilson, the executive director of the global, industry-backed Hydrogen Council, said hydrogen could become the most competitive low-carbon solution for some sectors by 2030, such as long-haul trucking and steel. “Other applications such as buildings and power will require a higher carbon cost to become cost-competitive,” he said. “However, these are currently also seeing strong momentum as large-scale and long-term solutions to decarbonise the gas grid.” Members of the global Hydrogen Council include Saudi Aramco, BP and Total, and some critics say hydrogen provides a “cover story for fossil fuels”. Luderer said the EU target for green hydrogen production in 2030 was a thousand times higher than current levels of production, suggesting the scale-up would have to go far faster than even the rapid solar energy rollout of the last decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-06T02:12:35Z","webTitle":"Coalition vetoes funding for wind and battery farm in northern Queensland ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","fields":{"headline":"Coalition vetoes funding for wind and battery farm in northern Queensland ","bodyText":"The Morrison government has vetoed public funding of a windfarm and battery project in northern Queensland, with a cabinet minister declaring it was inconsistent with its goals and policies. The Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif), a government agency, in January approved up to $280m funding for the Kaban green energy hub 80km south-west of Cairns. The proponents, Neoen Australia, estimated the development could reduce electricity prices for Queensland consumers by $461m over the life of the project. Keith Pitt, the minister for resources, water and northern Australia, blocked the loan in March. In a letter to the head of the agency, Pitt said the development would not provide “dispatchable” generation into the national electricity market and he was “not convinced” it would lower power prices. The blocked funding would have helped build a 157-megawatt windfarm and 100MW battery. The project also includes a 320km transmission line upgrade. Neoen says the hub would create 247 jobs during construction and five ongoing positions. In a written explanation of his reasons for the veto, Pitt said the government’s technology investment roadmap policy had identified that the widespread deployment of mature technologies including wind and solar energy would be mainly driven by the private sector unless there was a clear market failure. He said the government’s policy was to support dispatchable generation, which refers to electricity capacity that can be called on when required to support variable solar and wind energy. “I am satisfied that providing Naif support for the project would be inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the commonwealth government. Because of this, I am giving a rejection notice,” Pitt wrote. Labor’s spokesman on northern Australian, Murray Watt, said the letter showed the government had an “ideological obsession” against renewable energy that was costing jobs and lower power prices. The opposition’s climate change and energy spokesman, Chris Bowen, said north Queensland should be getting 250 new energy jobs and reduced electricity bills “but they’ve been hung out to dry”. “Queensland has the resources and the workers to continue to power the country and the world, but a government that is leaving them behind,” he said. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Pitt said his statement of reasons for the decision would be tabled in parliament as required under Naif legislation. “The company is free to put its case to other suppliers of finance, including the Queensland government,” he said. Neoen Australia told the Courier Mail the company was disappointed by the government’s decision, but remained committed to the project. Its website says Kaban has a wind profile different to most windfarms in the national grid, and it would be able to help provide stronger supply during periods of peak electricity use. The company has signed a power purchase agreement with the Queensland government-owned agency CleanCo under which it would provide energy to contribute to reaching the state target of 50% renewable energy by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-29T15:19:04Z","webTitle":"Barcelona installs Spain’s first solar energy pavement ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona installs Spain’s first solar energy pavement ","bodyText":"Barcelona city council has installed Spain’s first photovoltaic pavement as part of the city’s drive to become carbon neutral by 2050. The 50 sq metres of non-slip solar panels, installed in a small park in the Glòries area of the city, will generate 7,560kWh a year, enough to supply three households. The city has contributed €30,000 (£26,000) towards the cost, the remainder being met by the manufacturer, Platio Solar. The viability of the scheme will be assessed after six months. “We’ll have to assess the wear and tear because obviously it’s not the same as putting panels on a roof, although they are highly resistant,” says Eloi Badia, who is responsible for climate emergency and ecological transition at Barcelona city council. “As for cost benefits, with a pilot scheme like this it’s difficult to know yet how much cheaper it would be if it were scaled up. We’re keen to install more on roofs and, if this scheme is successful, on the ground, to power lighting and other public facilities.” However, he points out that Barcelona’s high population density means it would be difficult to generate enough electricity within the city limits to become self-sufficient. “If we’re going to reach a target of zero emissions, we’re going to have to think about supplying electricity to blocks of flats, but we’ll also have to think of using wind and solar parks outside the city,” Badia says. “But installations on the ground like this open up new possibilities, and not just for Barcelona.” The Barcelona scheme follows the installation of a 25-metre stretch of solar cycle lane in the Dutch city of Utrecht last year. The electricity generated is used to power lighting and also heat the path in winter to prevent it from icing over. Most of Spain’s solar power comes from large farms in remote areas where land is cheap but which are a long way from centres of population. The move now is to increase capacity close to where it’s most needed, in cities. “What we need to focus on is green policies to create employment, specifically to install solar panels on 1m rooftops,” says Fernando Prieto, executive director of the independent think tank Sustainability Observatory. “This would take five years, generate enough electricity for 7.5 million people, create over 15,000 jobs and cut CO2 emissions by 4.2m tonnes.” He adds that it would lower the price of electricity and help citizens to become independent of the few power companies that dominate the industry. “However, instead of this simple project, we are building installations of over 1,000 hectares on agricultural land and woodland, often with a negative impact on the environment,” Prieto says. Under the previous conservative government solar installation came to an abrupt halt after punitive taxes were introduced. In 2018, the incoming socialist coalition scrapped the tax, triggering a boom in solar, with Spain now ranked 11th in the world for solar power and eighth for renewables overall. Major retailers have got in on the act and now firms such as Ikea, electronics giant Media Markt and the department store El Corte Inglés are offering domestic solar installations at an average cost of €5,000 for a three-bedroom house. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to invest €1.5bn of EU Covid-recovery funds in the production of “green” hydrogen, using renewable energy to break up water molecules and release the hydrogen. Spain’s energy companies have said they will raise this to €8.3bn by 2030. • This article was amended on 30 April 2021. An earlier version referred to 7,560kW a year, when kWh was intended.

Confidential industry data suggests that up to 40% of the UK’s solar farms were built using panels manufactured by China’s biggest solar panel companies, including Jinko Solar, JA Solar and Trina Solar. These firms have been named in a recent report on the internment of more than 1 million men and women from the Muslim Uyghur community, in what UK MPs on Thursday voted to describe as genocide. Companies with factories or major suppliers in Xinjiang produce about a third of the polysilicon material used to make the world’s solar panels, according to a detailed report by the US consultancy Horizon Advisory. China is the world leader in polysilicon production. The report found that Chinese solar companies had ties to indicators of forced labour in Xinjiang, where Uyghur are interned, via this polysilicon production. China’s repression of the Uyghurs is believed to have developed into systematic detention about 2016, with reports of forced labour emerging from the region in the years since. An industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian that the industry was scrambling to distance itself from the use of forced labour, and that up to four in 10 of the UK’s existing solar farms were built using panels from the companies named in the report. While many were built before 2016, the Guardian has found a string of more recent deals that raise questions about how carefully UK businesses and government agencies are vetting their supply chains. Many manufacturers in China’s solar industry operate factories in countries across Asia but may still use the raw polysilicon materials produced in Xinjiang, making it difficult to determine whether a particular production line has been exposed to alleged labour exploitation. China limits access for outside observers and media to Xinjiang. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) this month revealed plans to install the first of 80 solar farms on the army estate at Leconfield, east Yorkshire, using thousands of panels made by Trina Solar as part of a deal with the UK energy firm Centrica. The MoD did not answer questions about what checks it had made on the companies’ supply chains, or whether panels with potential links to forced labour had been used on other sites. An MoD spokesperson said: “We have robust procedures in place that allow us to vet and routinely monitor all aspects of our supply chain, which is kept under constant review.” The UK’s Coal Authority, a government agency sponsored by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, has included solar panels made by JA Solar in a third of the solar farms it has built across its estate of former mining sites since 2017. A government spokesperson said: “We are thoroughly investigating recent allegations of forced labour in solar panel supply chains. In January we announced a comprehensive package of measures to help ensure no UK organisations are complicit in the serious human rights violations being perpetrated against the Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.” Some of the UK’s most prolific solar developers have used panels from the Xinjiang-linked companies. The Guardian has found that panels from the Chinese companies were used in projects built since 2016 by the FTSE 100 water company United Utilities, Scottish Water, and large solar developers including Bluefield Solar, Foresight Solar, and Solarcentury, owned by Norway’s Statkraft. As recently as January, Longi Solar, another panel maker, said it had shipped solar modules to an unnamed project near Rugby, Warwickshire. There has been a sharp slowdown in solar development in the UK since 2017, when the government cut subsidies. However, executives said the companies were deeply embedded in the UK industry before and after 2016. Foresight Solar Fund, a developer of some of the UK’s largest sites, said in its 2020 annual report that Trina had supplied 13% of its panels, while JA Solar provided 11%. Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK, a lobby group, said: “This is a matter that UK solar energy industry members are treating with the utmost seriousness.” He said making global supply chains “as transparent and sustainable as possible” brought a “significant degree of complexity”. Hewett said the UK solar industry was working with international trade bodies to develop a “traceability protocol” to safeguard the global supply chain from human rights abuses. Xinjiang’s polysilicon interests are allegedly controlled by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, an economic and paramilitary organisation that is facing US sanctions after accusations that the group has facilitated widespread human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Horizon, the consultancy, said the polysilicon companies “appear actively to participate in the resettlement” of ethnic Uyghurs, where they “enlist resettled labour at production facilities in Xinjiang” and contribute to the Uyghur “re-education” programmes. The report claims the reliance on Xinjiang effectively “implicates the entire solar supply chain in the human rights atrocities”. Many of the largest Chinese solar manufacturers are closely linked. Daqo Group, one of the world’s largest polysilicon suppliers, which has significant operations in Xinjiang, provides its high-purity silicon to Jinko Solar and Longi. Longi in turn supplies solar panel components to companies including JA Solar and Trina Solar, according to Horizon. None of the manufacturers responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment on the use of forced labour in the Xinjiang region. Jinko has previously said it condemns the use of forced labour and that the Horizon report does not “demonstrate forced labour in our facilities”. Centrica, which is responsible for developing the MoD’s solar projects, said: “We condemn the use of forced labour in the strongest possible terms.” A spokesperson said the company had worked “extensively” with Trina Solar over the past eight years. It had received anti-slavery statements from Trina throughout this time, and had also undertaken “quality assurance visits” to its main manufacturing site in China, the spokesperson added. United Utilities said all contracts for panels included clauses in relation to modern slavery, and said it would investigate any evidence of mistreatment of workers in its supply chain. Scottish Water said it would examine the Horizon report, and said it asked suppliers to confirm that they conform to expected standards. Foresight and Bluefield pointed to Solar Energy UK’s position on modern slavery. Solarcentury said tracing the supply chain was a “complex process”, but added: “Going forward, we will award new contracts where suppliers can demonstrate that the polysilicon for our projects has been sourced from a factory that respects human rights and which we can audit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/19/so-what-has-the-rest-of-the-world-promised-to-do-about-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-19T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"So what has the rest of the world promised to do about climate change?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/so-what-has-the-rest-of-the-world-promised-to-do-about-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/19/so-what-has-the-rest-of-the-world-promised-to-do-about-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"So what has the rest of the world promised to do about climate change?","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, home of the world’s biggest industrial polluter, the state-owned oil company Aramco, has long been regarded as a climate villain, accused of collaborating with other energy-producing states at international negotiations to water down ambitions and obstruct progress. Its 2015 NDC set a target of reducing emissions by up to 130 MtCO2e (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent) by 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario, a target that many analysts have described as inadequate. Assessing progress towards this modest goal has also proved impossible – the kingdom has not published any official projections of its emissions nor even defined the business-as-usual baseline it is measuring against. Independent assessments have concluded that based on the scant information that is available, the country is not on track to meet its pledge. Yet under the influence of its young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its dependence on oil in the decades ahead in recognition its supplies are not infinite, demand is falling and the world is searching for less destructive alternatives. To that end, it has announced a slew of environmental initiatives, including plans to generate 50% of the kingdom’s energy from renewables by 2030 and to plant 10bn trees, that have raised hopes it will take a more ambitious plan to Glasgow in November. In remarks to a state media agency, Prince Mohammed drew a direct link between the climate crisis and the health of Saudi citizens, signalling a potential shift in the Saudi attitude towards environmental issues. Analysts say achieving serious cuts in Saudi emissions would require significant changes that will be politically unpopular. Earlier grand announcements including plans to build massive solar farms have also failed to translate into meaningful action. But the Gulf state appears to be recognising that weaning itself off fossil fuels is becoming a political and economic imperative, as well as an environmental one. Michael Safi South Africa South Africa published a draft updated NDC last month (March), with ambitious targets to limit its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 398-440 MtCO2e by 2030, but many campaigners and analysts raised significant concerns about its continuing commitment to coal, which supplies 85% of South Africa’s power. A combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and a long term economic shift away from extractive industries and manufacturing has already helped South Africa move towards meeting some of its emission goals, but further progress will depend on massive investment in the country’s power sector, improvements in energy efficiency, a green transport strategy and a carbon tax. Gwede Mantashe, minister of mineral resources and energy, last month announced plans for a £2bn investment in renewables to accelerate a shift from coal power generation, but again there are concerns that few of the measures outlined in the updated draft NDC are likely to be implemented in a timely fashion, if at all. “South Africa’s target is far too weak … Our government’s answer is basically that they are going to continue polluting a lot for decades to come, but a little less more than they were going to do before,” said Dr Alex Lenferna, secretary of South Africa’s Climate Justice Coalition. South Africa has suffered rolling power cuts over recent years, which have dealt a crippling blow to an already struggling economy, and are forecast to continue for at least five years. But money is short. South Africa has already accessed about $2bn a year in 2018 and 2019 to meet adaptation and mitigation needs but will need four times more annually by 2030 to meet the targets laid out in the NDC. Jason Burke in Johannesburg China While China’s leader, Xi Jinping, pledged in September 2020 that China will increase its NDC commitments in order to peak the country’s carbon emissions before 2030, details of how it would get there have not yet been released. That “increased ambition” so far is not seen as ambitious enough; Climate Action Tracker, for instance, still rates China’s commitments as “highly insufficient”. Reality paints a bleak picture. Recent major infrastructure investments as part of a Covid-19 stimulus package, and the new carbon emissions from furious steel, cement and glass production, coupled with three straight years of rollbacks on regulations restricting approvals of new coal-fired power plants, have clouded China’s ambitions. Greenpeace findings released at the end of March suggest 46.1 GW of new coal capacity was greenlit in 2020, more than the combined total in the three previous years. For Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia, clarity is still needed about whether or not China will introduce additional ambition over Xi’s pledge last autumn, something that would be key to determining whether China could peak closer to 2025 than 2030. “One should really pay attention to the new ambition as opposed to the release of the [new] NDC, obviously the new ambition is the weighty stuff,” Li said. But a joint statement issued by the US and China on Saturday has given some cause for optimism. Li welcomed the development. “The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue [China and the US] will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume.” Michael Standaert in Shenzen Mexico Mexico was once considered an international climate leader. It was the first developing country to submit an NDC in 2015. Its NDC pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 22% and black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030. Conditional reductions of 36% and 70% were also promised. But its 2020 NDC disappointed climate campaigners, who said the country isn’t pursuing more ambitious targets. “It should have been more ambitious to begin with [and] their target is to reduce emissions to business as usual,” said Carolina Herrera of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who called Mexico’s NDC “utterly deficient” and “disappointing”. Mexico’s NDC promises nature based solutions such as protecting coastlines and reforestation, and plans also include refurbishing hydroelectric projects. The country also promises to slash emissions to 50% below 2000 levels by 2050. But meanwhile, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has actively moved against clean energy. His government cancelled clean energy auctions. He pushed an electricity industry law through Congress in March, which forces the state-owned electricity company to dispatch energy from its own (often dirty) power plants over privately owned renewable producers. The president also promised to revive the coal industry and has pushed the construction of a behemoth refinery in south-eastern Tabasco state. “They’re favouring the public fossil fuel sector at the expense of renewable energy and, frankly, their own citizens,” said Herrera, manager for green finance and climate change at the NRDC’s Latin America Project. David Agren Australia Australia’s most recent NDC just repeated the 2030 emissions reduction target set at the Paris summit: a 26-28% cut below 2005 emissions levels. No rationale has been given. The government had been advised to set a target equivalent to a 45-60% cut. Instead it just mirrored the reduction number set by the US under Barack Obama, but pushed the timeframe back five years. Prime minister Scott Morrison has not set a net zero emissions target, saying only that the country would “preferably” reach that mark by 2050. Quite how that may happen is not clear. The government has not introduced substantial climate policies, and official government projections suggest it will fall short of what is widely considered an unambitious 2030 target. There has been some progress. National emissions are already 18% below 2005 levels (largely due to cuts when the Labor opposition was in power) and cheap renewable energy is transforming the power grid at a rate faster than expected. But Australia still gets most of its electricity from burning coal, and emissions from the transport, mining and agriculture sectors are forecast to increase over the decade. The Morrison government says it is taking a “technology, not taxes” approach to the climate crisis, but to date has committed just A$18bn over a decade to technologies including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon. Critics have pointed out it has not explained how or when this approach will deliver emissions cuts. Adam Morton in Sydney Brazil More ambition is needed, say representatives from agribusiness, finance and academia, and business leaders. “Brazil was expected to present a more ambitious target than the previous one. We didn’t do that,” Carolina Genin, director of the climate programme at World Resources Institute Brasil, said. “In absolute terms, our ambition is lower.” The 2020 NDC kept the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by 2025, and 43% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. But climate experts warned that the new NDC increases emissions by at least 400 MtCO2e, compared with the targets submitted in 2015. To maintain the same absolute level of emissions, Brazil should update the cut to 57% by 2030, experts say. Jair Bolsonaro’s government, however, thinks the opposite. In the proposal submitted in December 2020, it said its NDC is “among the most ambitious in the world” and that, “as a developing country and a nation of late industrialization, Brazil’s historical contribution to climate change has been low”. The proposal has one page for the NDC and eight for the information annexe, which is shorter than that from neighbours such as Argentina, Peru and Colombia. It also lacks details on how targets will be met, according to Genin: “We expected progress in sectoral goals, which were in the first NDC and do not appear in the second. These are important goals such as zero illegal deforestation, a commitment to restore 12 million hectares, among others.” Brazil has been successful in combating deforestation of the Amazon in the past, a key factor in the country’s contribution to climate mitigation, “but the picture reversed dramatically in recent years”, Genin added. Ricardo Salles, the minister of the environment, said it can reduce by 40% in one year the fast-paced deforestation of the Amazon – but only if the country receives US$1bn in foreign aid. Flávia Milhorance in Rio de Janeiro Nigeria Nigeria plans to achieve emissions reductions by massively expanding solar energy production in the country, investing in alternative renewable energy and improving processes used to produce oil and gas. It will use more natural gas and limit gas flaring. It also hopes to bring solar power to 5m households or roughly 25 million people. For now, however, these remain ambitions. In 2015 Nigeria pledged a 20% reduction in its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in relative terms, based on what it is projected to emit. The pledge was updated in 2017, spelling out Nigeria’s commitments in more detail, but the fundamentals of its pledges were the same. Since 2015 progress has been very slow, with some reports of regression. Nigeria’s pledges were based on the economy growing by 5% a year, roughly where economic growth was at the time of the agreement. The economy has been in recession twice since 2015, in one of the toughest periods in a generation for Africa’s largest economy and oil producer. This is in part caused by steep drops in crude oil prices on which Nigeria still heavily relies. A major part of Nigeria’s economic plan has been to expand the agriculture sector and make it more productive, implementing policies which critics say will increase emissions. Emmanuel Akinwotu in Lagos Canada The government of Justin Trudeau has cast itself as climate champions. In 2015, Canada initially committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. A reduction of that scope would see emissions in the country from the current rate of about 730 megatonnes down to 511 megatonnes. But the reality is far different, with a report this week showing emissions have only dropped 1% below 2005 levels – far off course. “The trend is very clear: we’re still on track to miss our Paris pledge by quite a lot,” said Jessica Green, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto who specialises in climate governance. “We just don’t see what the interim steps are that will put us on the path to meet those targets.” Governing Liberals have introduced legislation that would legally bind the government to net zero by 2050, but the bill has not yet progressed throughout parliament. The bulk of Canada’s emissions come from its tar sands – one of the world’s largest petroleum reserves. Emissions from the tar sands continue to rise each year. A recent court victory has received hopes for a nationwide carbon tax, which the government plans to raise to $170/tonne by 2030. But Green cautions the fight will probably be “politically difficult”, and one that might not be as effective as other policy measures, including electrifying parts of the country’s power grid that remain reliant on fossil fuels, making public transit free – and shutting down the tar sands. Unlike many other industrialised nations, Canada has never met any of its emissions reduction targets – a custom the governing Liberals promised to end. “I think that there’s kind of more openness to this idea that the government needs to really intervene more strongly,” said Green. But at the same time, there are still a lot of political challenges to make that a reality.

Football has been thrown into turmoil after plans were confirmed last night for the European Super League, with six English clubs – Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham – joining the breakaway competition alongside three each from Italy and Spain. Boris Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, condemned proposals that were met with widespread criticism from around the continent. Organisers have announced they want to begin the competition in August. The plan threatens not only the future of the Champions League but could have a seismic impact on the entire structure of the club game. In England the Premier League urged clubs “to walk away immediately before irreparable damage is done”. The former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville reacted furiously on Sky Sports: “I’m disgusted with Manchester United and Liverpool the most,” he said, adding the Premier League should “deduct them all points, put them at the bottom of the league, and take their money off them”. The league would be structured around midweek fixtures with all participating clubs hoping to still compete in their respective national leagues. The big German and French clubs have so far said they they are not interested in joining. Jonathan Liew writes: “This is an idea that could only have been devised by someone who truly hates football to its bones … the biggest clubs have laid out their vision for the future of football: a 12-month reality television show whose sole purpose is to generate a ceaseless stream of content, animus and talking points.” * * * Houses scarce as 95% mortgages launch – A frenzy of activity has driven UK property prices to a record high this month, just as some lenders from today begin offering mortgages covering 95% of the purchase price. The government-guaranteed scheme is intended to help people with small deposits on to the housing ladder. Rightmove said the average asking price jumped by 2.1% in April to a new all-time high of £327,797, an increase of £6,733 from March. The surge was driven by a shortage of houses on the market, as the pandemic drives families to search for more spacious properties away from cities where they can work from home. Some potential sellers are also holding off until they have been vaccinated, agents say. * * * Props to Mars – In a few hours Nasa is due to attempt the first powered, controlled aircraft flight on another planet. If all goes to plan the Ingenuity drone helicopter carried to Mars by the Perseverance rover mission will start its propellers, take off, hover, rotate and land again, in the first of what are planned to be several flights. Because the Mars atmosphere is just 1% as dense as Earth’s, Ingenuity’s rotor blades are four feet long and spin more rapidly than would be needed here. It has only ever been tested in Nasa’s vacuum chambers. * * * Oil giants less green than their ads – Big fossil fuel companies have used advertising to greenwash how they contribute to the climate crisis, according to files published by the environmental lawyers ClientEarth. The files compare adverts produced by ExxonMobil, Aramco, Chevron, Shell, Equinor and others with the companies’ operations and products, overall climate impact and progress toward climate-safe business models. ClientEarth is calling on policymakers to ban all fossil fuel company ads unless they come with tobacco-style health warnings about the risks of global heating. Shell and Chevron defended their climate goals, with the latter saying it engages in “honest conversations about the energy transition”. * * * Cuba after the Castros – Raúl Castro’s announcement on Friday that he is to retire and bring 62 years of Castro rule to a close caused barely a ripple on the island, even if it sent waves around the world. “I don’t think there will be any significant changes in the near future,” said one man. “Not as long as the old guard casts its shadow and influence on Cuban politics.” For Cubans, the priority remains food. Donald Trump derailed Castro’s 2016 detente with the Obama administration and even hard-nosed business people have been surprised at Joe Biden’s refusal to reverse Trump’s course. A rally against “the US blockade” took place in Havana recently. It is all but certain that Raúl Castro will be replaced as the party’s supremely powerful first secretary by Miguel Díaz Canel, the 60-year-old, white male president. * * * Retail art – Its “essential” products will include toilet roll, teabags, washing-up liquid, passata and gin – but not as we know them. England’s museums and galleries can’t reopen until after 17 May, but shops can open. So the Design Museum in London will this week reopen its shop as a supermarket, selling a range of products with packaging designed by emerging artists. Open for just five days, the redesigned shop will sell the products at similar prices to a supermarket. They include a kidney beans tin designed by Kentara Okwara (70p), a porridge oat jar by Amy Warrall (£1.10), toilet roll by Michaela Yearwood-Dan (50p), a rice box by Joey Yu (£2), and washing-up liquid by Jess Warby (£2).

Kelechi Iheanacho’s second-half goal earned Leicester a 1-0 victory over Southampton at Wembley to take them into the FA Cup final for the first time since 1969. Mason Greenwood scored twice for Manchester United, his second an 84th-minute deflection, in their 3-1 win against a stubborn Burnley.

Former England scrum-half Kyran Bracken has spoken to the Guardian on spearheading the brain injury campaign and his own struggles with anxiety and OCD. Hull FC and Warrington played out the first draw of the Super League season, with the hosts preserving their unbeaten start under Brett Hodgson after neither side were able to strike the decisive blow in golden point extra time. Ben Spencer’s nerveless last-minute touchline conversion sealed a dramatic 21-20 victory for Bath against Leicester, to keep the hosts’ Premiership play-off hopes alive. And a touchdown in a college football game in Pennsylvania has gone viral after a bizarre pass from Villanova Wildcats quarterback Daniel Smith. Business Investors in fossil fuels project are demanding four times the return they will accept from renewable energy projects, a University of Oxford study has found. Lenders typically require wind and solar energy projects to return at least 10% to 11% but for investments in coal the figure rockets to 40% to justify the rising risk that a polluting project might be left stranded as governments ramp up climate action. Asian share trading has been mixed. Japan’s benchmark quickly lost early gains in the first market reaction to a weekend summit between the prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, and President Joe Biden. Suga also spoke with the Pfizer chief executive asking for a more steady supply of its Covid-19 vaccine. In Australia the S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained, as did South Korea’s Kospi, while the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite were lower. Expect an uptick on the FTSE when it opens. The pound is worth $1.383 and €1.157 at time of writing. The papers The Guardian print edition today leads with “Cut poverty to reduce crime, says police leader”. Marking his retirement as chief constable of Merseyside police, Andy Cooke said that if he was given £5bn to cut crime, he would put £1bn into law enforcement and £4bn into tackling poverty.
