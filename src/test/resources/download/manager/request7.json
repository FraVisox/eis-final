But pain is Kennedy's specialist subject, and her determination to dissect it unwavering. As we follow Nathan Staples on his quest for redemption, we move from hideous gallows humour to mawkish tragedy, from confusion and ignorance to a semblance of clarity. This is extreme writing, and Kennedy occasionally chances her arm. For the most part, thankfully, the risks pay off. The Leper's Companions Julia Blackburn (Vintage, £6.99) Buy it at BOL At the beginning of this disquieting novel, a grief-stricken woman decides to conjure up an imagined world in order to soothe her pain. On that overtly flimsy basis, Blackburn takes us back to the 15th century, to mermaids washed up on beaches, omens and portents, and pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Fanciful though this might sound, Blackburn is a skilful and subtle enough writer to pull it off, and her tale of journeys - both literal and metaphysical, inward and outward - is an arresting one. Fittingly for such a daring novel, it speaks volumes about the power of the imagination to transform an unbearable reality. The White Bone Barbara Gowdy (Flamingo, £6.99) Buy it at BOL Gowdy has always been a somewhat surreal writer - her excellent novel Mister Sandman featured a mute little girl who conducted much of her life from the inside of a cupboard. Here, she turns her attention to the elephant kingdom, telling the story of Mud, an orphan member of the tribe who is blessed with visionary powers. The novel ranges across the east African plains, as the elephants flee the \"hindleggers\" and struggle to survive in the face of terrible drought. It may all sound a little whimsical, but Gowdy is a strong writer, and she introduces several compelling strands exploring the power of memory and language to bind a community together. Boxy an Star Daren King (Abacus, £6.99) Buy it at BOL \"I reckon all memories are gone rotten these days coz no one can remember nothin.\" So says the teenaged Bole, in this futuristic tale of fourth-generation drug-users. Written entirely in a broken-down, spaced-out demotic, Boxy an Star tells the story of Bole, his lover and their drug-dealer, and the permanent, meandering quest for the next hit. Such is the strength and originality of King's narrative voice, however, that this book escapes the narrow confines of the druggy novel to become a powerful and tender depiction of juvenile emotion that veers wildly between farcical comedy and desperate melancholy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/apr/30/features.magazine47","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-29T23:24:56Z","webTitle":"Beyond belief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/apr/30/features.magazine47","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/apr/30/features.magazine47","fields":{"headline":"Beyond belief","bodyText":"On a grassy knoll above the remote village of Kabumba, about 120 miles west of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, is a small Catholic church built out of locally baked red bricks. Geckos flick over the iron roof and cows carefully crop the long grass around the base of its scrubbed walls. The sky is wide and open over the rolling hills. It was built, in 1984, by Joseph Kibwetere, a local landowner and businessman, one-time government minister, lay preacher, devout Catholic and father of eight. Quite how Kibwetere the respected pillar of the local church became Kibwetere the heretic mass murderer is not entirely clear. He was born in 1936 and raised in a devout Catholic family. He inherited some land and started a number of successful businesses. He embarked on a political career and by the 70s, under Idi Amin's lunatic rule, had risen to be head of the government's public works commission. Then came disappointment. When Amin was ousted, Kibwetere lost his political position and much of his fortune. It was a bitter blow. He retired to land he had bought in the west of Uganda and sought solace in the church and his faith. Kibwetere's money and previous political activity soon earned him respect. His reputation for piety was, by all accounts, well earned. His children describe their father's insistence on church attendance, rosaries before they slept at night and prayer meetings before they went to school. Kibwetere's house is only a few hundred yards from the church he built. His estranged wife, Theresa, and several of his six surviving children still live there. It is a low bungalow surrounded by bougainvillea and umbrella trees, and is reached up a winding track lined with hibiscus. Giles, Kibwetere's son, is keen to talk about his father. The interview is hardly a global exclusive - 38 other journalists have signed themselves into the family's 'visitor's book'. Giles, 36, says, no doubt for the 39th time, how shocked and surprised he is and how his father was a good man who was led astray. We sit in the family's front room on wooden chairs covered with red plastic. It is modest and clean, and there are perhaps 30 separate images of Christ, the saints or the Virgin Mary on the walls. In one corner is a 3ft, painted baked-clay Madonna. After a few minutes, Theresa, Kibwetere's ex-wife, joins us. She has just returned from church and is still wearing her best outfit - a floral-print dress and an orange headscarf. She has two Madonna and child pendants around her neck and a watch with a Madonna and child face. I tell her she looks very smart, and she cackles and shakes her head. I know from local press cuttings that she joined the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments at its inception and that her home was the cult's base from 1989 to 1993, when she had them expelled by the authorities. I ask her how she and her husband first came to be involved. 'It was in 1989,' she says quietly, and I have to move closer to her as the rain hammers off the tin roof above us. Her English is soft and has a rhythm learned from years of Bible study. 'We used to read in papers [religious pamphlets] of messages from heaven, and we were learning from them what our blessed mother in heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ were saying to the world, and we were sad because it had not happened here. We were good Catholics, as we had been raised to be and had been all our lives. And then something that we thought was a miracle happened. In that year, a woman came to see us who said that she had got messages from heaven. And then she said that our Lady told her that a man called Joseph would come, and that when he came people should follow him to his home. Can you imagine how we felt? Our blessed mother had sent a message with my husband's name. And her name was Credonia, and we believed what she said was true.' She pauses and smooths down the dress with long, delicate fingers. 'So in July of that year the woman called Credonia came here to our home, and she went out preaching, and soon many more people came, and by the end of the year there were more than 200 of them living here and all praying all the time, and Credonia slept in the same room as me and Joseph, and for a time we were very happy.' She pauses again. 'But things began to change. My husband was always a cheerful man and loving to his children, but soon he started striking them. The woman [Credonia] said schools were bad, so all my children were taken out of class and then they were mistreated and not given enough food, and there was a time when my youngest daughter ran away and she came back and she was so bitterly beaten by this woman that she was bleeding from her nose and her mouth, and another daughter was beaten, too. And we sold lots of our land and our vehicle and our fridge and our cooker, and all the money was given to Credonia. And even I was disrespected, and one morning I went out and all my clothes had been burned, and I called my husband and he just looked and walked away. 'Finally, in 1993, my son went to the authorities and all of them were made to leave, and that is when they went to Kanungu, and my husband went with them, and they said they were going to build an ark to go to heaven, but instead they all died, and that woman will go to hell because this is the work of Satan.' She crosses herself carefully. 'It was all Credonia,' she says. 'My husband was just a token for her because she needed some respectability, and my husband was very respectable here. We tried to persuade him to come back to us, but he did not come. I have not seen him for so many years. The woman used to call herself \"The Programmer\". Whatever she said, people did. She was sent by the Satan. She came to us and we believed her, and I was led astray by the Evil one, but I am a good Catholic and I was born a Catholic and will die a Catholic.' On 24 August 1989 - a month after she had told Joseph Kibwetere that the Virgin Mary had told her to seek him out and live in his house - Credonia Mwerinde and her husband, Eric Mazima, had the last of a series of fierce arguments. Mwerinde, then 37, had told Mazima that she had seen the face of the Virgin Mary on a rock in a cave nearby. Mazima, a grizzled labourer, told her she was talking rubbish. She said she would leave him. He told her she wanted to go back to being a prostitute. She walked out, took a local taxi over to Kabumba, and within a few days had set her self up with Joseph and Theresa Kibwetere. Mwerinde grew up on her father's small farm in the remote village of Kanungu - about a two-hour drive west of Kabumba. Though heavily farmed, the hills are steep, and the fields and plantations are studded with patches of thick and fetid undergrowth. From the higher ridges, the mountains of the Ruwenzori, Rwanda and the Congo can be seen to the west like a dark, smudged pencil line drawn along the horizon. The village is dominated by a sizeable red-brick Catholic church - the biggest building for miles. Not far away is the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest (bwindi means 'dark' or 'black' in the local language), where eight tourists, including four Britons, were abducted and murdered last year. Though the land around Kanungu was cleared decades ago, it feels eerie - as if the jungle was only hacked away last week. Mwerinde had two sisters and three brothers. She completed two years at a local Catholic missionary school, according to locals in Kanungu, but left still using her thumbprint as a signature. She spent her teenage years helping her parents in their fields and then worked as a housegirl for a businessman who lived nearby. For 10 years she ran a local shebeen in a rented hut in Kanungu, serving up banana-based hooch for two shillings a flask. She did not join the 90 per cent of the local community in church on Sundays but kept her bar open, jeering at the faithful. Local people remember that she could 'twist men round her fingers' and say that she was prone to sudden violence. To supplement her income, she sold herself and married one of her clients, Mazima, in 1981. By the late 80s her bar was failing and she was unpopular in the village. She needed another way of making a living. Throughout the 80s the Ugandan newspapers were full of stories of born-again Christian churches and their bizarre evangelical offshoots. Every week, it seemed, new prophets were springing up, tapping into Uganda's rich millenarian tradition and often making a large amount of money. Mwerinde had always been able to manipulate people and, locals admit, she had a certain malign charisma. To lead a cult would mean power, money and prestige - none of which she had ever had. But she recognised that in rural Uganda's conservative and religious society, she would need a figurehead to give her group legitimacy. She knew of Joseph Kibwetere by reputation. He was pious and wealthy and, it was said, somewhat lacking in self-esteem, perhaps a little weak, a little vulnerable. By the end of 1990, Mwerinde was comfortably installed at Kibwetere's house. By the time she was expelled from the Kabumba house in 1993, she had a sizeable following. She inherited her family's land when her father died in 1991 and installed the group there. Mwerinde outlined her creed in a book called A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Times. Though most of the book is written with Old Testament enthusiasm - she tells how 'the Lord has told me that hurricanes of fire would rain forth from heaven and spread over those who would not have repented' - much of the book appears to owe more to Idi Amin at his maddest than to Isaiah. Mwerinde established an unremitting routine of hard physical labour, marathon prayer sessions and inadequate food and sleep. The cult's liturgy was an extraordinary fusion of Ugandan Catholicism, Pentecostal evangelism, apocalyptic doom-mongering and local superstition. Cult members were working to be 'redeemed' when the great 'sift' came. They had to guard against constant temptation - not least by evil local spirits. Only the strictest adherence to Mwerinde's codes could ensure salvation. The cult members slept on thin papyrus mats packed into overcrowded dormitories. Men were segregated from women, and sex was forbidden. Everyone had to wear green and white gowns. All conversation was banned. Medication was forbidden - even when children started dying of measles - and no visitors were allowed into the main compound. Discipline was maintained with fierce beatings. The leaders lived apart with better food and lodging. Mwerinde, who was usually seen in flowing white robes with a gold cross around her neck, got fat over the 11 years she ran the cult. Life was grim. 'Monday and Friday were strictly for fasting,' Besigye Emmanuel, once a carpenter at the cult's church, says. 'The rest of the days we'd get a bowl of porridge or some maize and millet bread for lunch, but that was all. We'd get up at dawn and work in the fields until it was dark, with an hour off at noon. Then we'd pray and sing until midnight.' Mwerinde used a variety of means to separate cult members from their cash. As the police have yet to trace any bank accounts, the extent of her wealth will probably never be known. For some there was a joining fee; others were threatened with expulsion (and thus banishment from the kingdom of heaven) unless they handed over their property. The greed was undisguised. On one occasion, Mwerinde is said to have rushed into the cult's church screaming that the Virgin Mary had just spoken to her. The message: 'You must give me more money, or we will all be damned.' The cult members' credulity seems almost pathetic. In a room close to the church where so many died, a shrine was set up consisting of a dozen clay statues of the Holy Family on a desk. Every week it was covered with transparent plastic and a lantern placed on the floor underneath. Then, in the evening, the cult members filed in to gasp at the visitation from heaven bathed in celestial light. The question must be why so many people - authorities believe there were up to 4,000 members at a number of different compounds throughout western Uganda - accepted such a life. The cult leaders undoubtedly targeted the vulnerable, but still it stretches the bounds of credibility that so many people could be so deceived. I am sitting in a bar in the dirty, ragged, muddy town of Rukengiri drinking warm Nile beer with Johnson and Herbert, two local wide boys. I have just driven an hour over dirt roads from Kanungu and it is getting dark and the rain is coming in again. The stench of rotting corpses that hangs over the cult compound is still on my clothes. Johnson and Herbert are alternating beers - which they drink through straws from the bottle - with beakers full of Malibu. 'This thing is true, my friend,' says Johnson while smoothing the creases on his wide-collared blue shirt. 'Everyone here wants to go some place else. To America, to Europe, to South Africa, even to Kampala, just anywhere but here.' Uganda may not be the poorest part of Africa, and the area around Kanungu may be comparatively prosperous, but for most people here, life is harsh. Only half can read and only slightly more have access to clean water. The region's history is chequered with hideous violence - from Idi Amin's purges in the 70s, through the civil war of the 80s to the recent genocide in Rwanda. This red earth has soaked up a lot of blood. Fifteen years of relative stability might now have brought some measure of development, but the pace of change is slow. Few of those who died at Kanungu can have expected any improvement in their lifetime. In the circumstances, attempting to ensure a better time in the next seems relatively sensible. The exploitation of such emotions is not new in Uganda. Religions, organised or otherwise, have been fighting for souls here since the Western imperial nations decided that there were souls here worth saving some 150 years ago. Missionaries from almost every denomination have since streamed across the country's valleys and jungles. It must be one of the most heavily proselytised places on earth. It is rotten with religion. But these days, the mainstream churches - wracked with internal dissent and full of poorly trained priests - are less and less able to provide spiritual solace. Instead, many Ugandans are turning to newer churches. In the past 20 years, there has been a massive growth in pentecostal churches in East Africa in general and Uganda in particular. Several hundred church organisations are now registered with Kampala alone. Though the new evangelists vehemently deny that their mushrooming growth and the proliferation of cults is in any way linked, the police investigating the Kanungu tragedy are less sure. The leaders of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments have a number of intriguing links overseas - it appears that the Kibweteres had attended talks given in Kampala by an Australian doomsday group: the Marian Workers of Atonement. It was shortly after meeting Reverend William Kamm, the leader of the group, that the Kibweteres were first contacted by Mwerinde. 'Since the 80s Uganda has started receiving hundreds of people claiming to be religious,' says Eric Naigambi, a police spokesman. 'Many people have started their own churches. The boundaries between cults and the new churches get very blurred.' There is a strong indigenous tradition of home-grown cults. One reason for the massive popularity of the Pentecostal churches in Uganda is that they key in to an established cultic culture. People claiming to speak the word of the Lord are not unusual in these parts. Last year, police closed down two groups - the World Last Morning Message Church and the Following of the Prophet Nabassa. The former preached that the more money you gave the cult, the more likely you were to go to heaven; the latter vested a young woman with a supernatural ability to cure Aids. The police say that the two were just the 'tip of the mountain'. The bulk of those who died in Kanungu and the related sites were middle-aged women and former Catholics. Dr Stanley Kinyatta, the MP for Kanungu, believes that the age is significant. As education in Uganda was in the hands of mainly Catholic missionaries until the late 60s, almost all the cult members would have been raised on a diet of biblical literalism and deference to authority. Though they might have known their Bible, the women were unlikely ever to have read it themselves. Most were virtually illiterate. 'I grew up among these people,' says Kinyatta. 'We were taught to believe that whatever the priest says is right. Under the colonial powers, that was an important means of control. These people learned an unquestioning obedience.' Another hilltop venue, another astonishingly mundane location for acts of appalling horror. Hannah Arendt famously talked of the banality of evil, and nothing could be more banal than the quaint little bungalow of Father Dominic Kataribabo. There are neat flowerbeds with red luwanye flowers. There is a view over the Queen Elizabeth national park. When the skies are clear, the skyline is jagged with the distant mountains. And under the good priest's bedroom, police found 82 bodies packed and stacked into a tiny cellar. In a pit nearby, another 73 were found. Despite the fresh rain and the flowers, the stench of putrid flesh still lies heavy in the air when I visit. Father Kataribabo was the third most powerful of the leaders of the sect, and it was at his home that the killing seems to have begun. Until the early 80s, Kataribabo had been a good Catholic priest working his way up the church hierarchy. He was bright and ambitious. But a nasty and complex political wrangle with rivals for senior positions in the church saw him exiled to the small parish church in the village of Rugazi. There are parallels with Kibwetere's fall from political grace at around the same time. By 1990, he was in touch with Mwerinde. By 1993, he had been reported to the archbishop in Kampala for his claims that he had a 'direct' route to God bypassing the pope and the church. He was excommunicated from the priesthood, though he continued preaching. Almost all the bodies found at Kataribabo's home had been hacked with machetes, strangled and bludgeoned to death. So had the 153 bodies found at a cult-owned farm in nearby Buhunga village, as well as the 81 buried at another cult member's house in the town of Rushojwa. Some appear to have been poisoned with a pesticide, Dithane. Six battered corpses, doused with acid, were found under the leaders' living quarters at Kanungu. Even without the church fire, it would have been a holocaust. Nobody yet knows what happened to spark the murders - no one was killed before the start of this year - but the police believe they were motivated by greed. As chiliastic leaders the world over found to their chagrin, the world did not end at midnight on 31 December 1999. This posed a problem to the leaders of the Kanungu cult, because they had predicated most of their teachings on an ascent to heaven with the coming of the new year. The cult members would escape an apocalyptic flood, they said, when the Lord sent a chariot of fire to rescue them, and neither had materialised. To start with, Mwerinde was unworried. Confident of her cult members' trust - and her brutal regime's success in cowing them - she merely announced that she had been told by Christ that Judgment Day had been rescheduled for 31 March. But her confidence appears to have been misplaced, and scores of disappointed cult members began to get restive. Some demanded their money back. The most vociferous tended to be the younger men. They were the first to die. Quite how they died is unclear. According to some reports, the cult's farm manager at Kanungu - a giant of a man called Robert Kanangura - was the chief executioner. But he could not have murdered 400 or more people alone. Instead, it seems likely that a group of the most devoted of the cult members carried out the killings. The victims would have been summoned to a personal audience with Mwerinde - a great honour - and then hacked to death. The rule of silence would have prevented any loose talk in the compound and, as cult members were frequently moved between sites, suspicions would have been limited. But the leaders knew that convincing their followers of any further celestial reschedulings would be impossible. The movement would collapse when the March deadline passed. Though Mwerinde and the others could easily have slipped away one night, they instead decided to squeeze the cult for all they could get. They decided to recruit as many people as they could, take their property and then kill them. Sometime in January, the half-literate former prostitute, the frustrated politician and the failed priest must have sat down and decided to murder as many people as they possibly could - in the event, more than 1,000 - for their money. In early February, they launched a recruitment drive. A series of radio advertisements were broadcast throughout western Uganda. The national radio station was even approached about a wider campaign. Thousands of leaflets were distributed and scores of ex-members received personal visits from the cult leaders. This is it, they were told, this is your last chance for eternal peace and salvation. By early March, preparations were well underway. Kataribabo bought several dozen litres of sulphuric acid from a store in Rukengiri. Several large jerry cans full of petrol were bought. All cult members were told to sell off their property and burn whatever was left. Livestock and equipment at the Kanungu farm were sold off at knockdown prices. And the taxis full of those answering the call of the leaflets and the advertisements kept pulling up at the cult's headquarters. Late on the evening of 16 March, Kibwetere appeared at the local police post, which had neither telephone nor vehicles. He handed over the Movement's articles of registration and land titles. Up at their compound, an unprecedented celebration was underway. Cattle had been slaughtered and roasted over fires and soft drinks distributed. At midnight, up to 550 people trooped into the church. Its windows were nailed shut - to keep out the coming floods. The church was an ark that would take them to heaven. They prayed, sang and chanted through the night. Around 8am, according to witnesses, a group of cult members emerged from the church and rounded up children who had been playing in the flowerbeds outside. The doors of the building were then nailed shut from the inside. The entire congregation smeared themselves in 'Nightrose' - a highly inflammable oil - and then lit candles. At their head stood the giant farm manager. From physical evidence retrieved by investigators it appears that he ignited - possibly with a flaming torch - one of the barrels full of petrol that stood in each corner. Around 550 people, including 78 children, were incinerated within moments. The Ugandan police have stopped digging for bodies. They admit there are probably many more to be found, but say they simply don't have the resources to deal with any more corpses. The death toll already exceeds that of the Jim Jones's mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978, so what's the point in excavating more, they say. They have made one not particularly impressive arrest. The Reverend Richard Mutazendwa, a Kanungu official who is alleged to have accepted gifts of cattle and cash from the cult in return for deflecting the attention of suspicious government inspectors, is now languishing in prison. Credonia Mwerinde, Joseph Kibwetere and Father Dominic Kataribabo are still at large. There is an Interpol alert out for them, but few are hopeful that they will be brought to justice. The cults' main vehicle - a blue Toyota pick-up truck - disappeared on the night of the blaze and has only been seen once since: in a small village close to the border with Rwanda and the Congo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/apr/30/featuresreview.review2","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-29T23:24:56Z","webTitle":"In defence of evil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/apr/30/featuresreview.review2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/apr/30/featuresreview.review2","fields":{"headline":"In defence of evil","bodyText":"It was the third day of rehearsal. Sitting round a huge table in the bowels of the National Theatre, actors about to play Hitler, Himmler, Eva Braun and the stage army of the Third Reich were debating the plausibility of Hitler's Minister of Armaments not knowing about what was happening to Jews and others in the slave-labour and death camps of the Nazi empire. Suddenly, the argument escalated. Albert Speer was Hitler's favourite. As his architect, he had been a vital part of the Nazi propaganda machine. As his armourer, he was responsible for millions of slave-workers kept in unspeakable conditions. He kept the war going for a year longer than it needed to, at the cost of untold suffering. Whatever he knew or didn't know, did Speer have a case worth presenting? Was it worth us doing a play about this man at all? This was not the first time this question had come up. It had been central to the discussions I had had with the play's director Trevor Nunn during its development. And for both of us there was a sense of déjà vu: the same debate had raged around a play I wrote about the rise of the National Front in Seventies Britain, which Trevor programmed for the RSC in 1976. By seeking to understand people with dreadful opinions, or people complicit in crimes resulting from those opinions, is the writer (or director or actor) inevitably tending to condone? The first immediate, instinctive response in this case is that the play Albert Speer is based on a well-reviewed, highly regarded and massively successful biography by Gitta Sereny, whose moral credentials and dignity of purpose were questioned by no one. However, this argument falls apart when the material is transferred to the theatre. However passionate its author, a work of history has an essentially magisterial relationship with its readership. Like the French legal system, the medium invites sober consideration of the evidence, the balancing of arguments and the disinterested search for truth. Like a British courtroom, a play tends to the adversarial, demanding that the jury identify with one side. In this case, there is no sober summing-up of the evidence, many of the prosecution witnesses are dead, and the accused is conducting his own defence. And however critical we may be of him and it, are we not - by the very act of presenting it - implying that he has a case? Or - even more insidiously - that his moral anguish can be set against the suffering for which he has been held responsible? Further, we are aware that we're telling this story at a moment when the history of the Second World War is a matter of acute and current political contest. However unambiguous Mr Justice Gray's finding may have been, the Irving trial reminded everyone how much of the darkest events of the war are subject to interpretation, how deep is the controversy about the aims and history of the Holocaust, and how much of our knowledge of it is based on essentially circumstantial evidence. And we are exploring the case for and against a leading Nazi at a time when the supposed effects of writing are subject to unprecedented scrutiny. Not only are works of fiction cited as inspiring, if not causing, real-life crimes (the 'go thou and do likewise' theory of literary influence) but works of non-fiction are called to account for the harm or even distress they might cause. Following the publication of her 1998 book about the Mary Bell case, Cries Unheard, Gitta Sereny herself was accused by the parents of Mary's victims of 'bringing up all the bad memories'. From this understandable concern with the feelings of people involved in tragedies, it has proved a short step to the argument advanced by a reader protesting against the serialisation of Gordon Burns's book about Frederick and Rosemary West in the Guardian on the grounds of the 'suffering, despair and pain involved in the subject matter', not for the relatives of West's victims, but for everyone. And both Marcus Harvey's painting of and Diane Dubois's play about the continuing iconic influence of Myra Hindley were condemned on the grounds that it was inappropriate to treat of her in art at all. And yet - of course - if the subject of evil was removed from the dramatic canon, most of the great tragedies would disappear from the repertoire. From Clytemnestra and Oedipus via Richard III, Macbeth and Othello to the gangsters, gunslingers and Godfathers of twentieth-century cinema, great drama has always been obsessed with killers, natural born and otherwise. If it was really true that the purpose of drama is to encourage its audiences to imitate the behaviour of its protagonists, then the medium has a great deal to answer for. But, sadly, the opposite view - that the point of drama is precisely to discourage such behaviour by showing how it will inevitably get its comeuppance - doesn't really wash. 'Don't do this at home' is as misleading a description of what drama counsels us as 'go thou and do likewise'. The awful truth - and it is awful, in both senses of the word - is that the response most great drama asks of us is neither 'yes please' nor 'no thanks' but 'you too?'. Or, in the cold light of dawn, 'there but for the grace of God go I'. When, understandably but sadly, the parents of Mary Bell's victims wrote in the Sun that 'Mary Bell is not worthy of consideration as a feeling human being', they were letting the rest of us off the hook. The notion that there is a thing called evil which separates the wicked off from the rest of us is a comforting illusion. The uncomfortable truth is that to understand does involve recognition and even empathy. It does require seeing the world through the eyes of the wicked person, and thus finding those impulses and resentments and fears within ourselves that could - we painfully have to admit - drive us to commit dreadful acts under different circumstances. As Peter Brook writes in The Empty Space, 'in the theatre the slate is wiped clean all the time'. Drama is a test-bed on which we can test and confront our darkest impulses under laboratory conditions; where we can experience the desires without having to confront the consequences. Drama enables us to peer into the soul, not of the person who has driven his father out onto the heath, but the person who has wanted to. But that's only the first shock. The second is that we enjoy the view. Indeed, the pleasure is the thing that allows us to confront these unbearable aspects of ourselves. This is why children like fictional forms whose familiarity is distanced by their location in the mythic past, the animal kingdom or outer space. And despite the wealth of all-too-human examples of monstrosity, adult audiences too demand villains from other worlds, different species and indeed beyond the grave. Since the late nineteenth century, the assumption has been that the closer drama is to the lives of its audience, the more powerful and painful it will be. But the problem with looking in a mirror is that you see what the world sees. Look into a picture, and you may see what you have disguised. Finally, because we see ourselves in him, the tragic villain commands our sympathy (indeed, the difference between the tragic and the melodramatic villain is quite precisely that). At the end of Albert Speer, a dying man thinks he sees his past self approaching him through the mist but discovers that what is really inside him is not his own past but the terrible reality of a man he had once admired and loved. Looking at him confronting that truth, I hope the audience will look back through that refraction at itself. Albert Speer was subject to a Faustian temptation, fell for it, and spent the rest of his life creating a past with which he could deal. To be one of his many victims is - thank goodness - unimaginable for a well-fed First World audience in the year 2000. To give in to personal ambition, to realise a moral and ideological error too late, and to spend the rest of your life making inadequate sense of that failure is all too recognisable. As screenwriter Paul Schrader argued in defence of Taxi Driver, if writers stopped inventing criminals, 'we would still have psychopaths, but we wouldn't have art. We would still have Raskolnikovs but we wouldn't have Crime and Punishment.' If Gitta Sereny hadn't written her book about Albert Speer, his slave-workers would still have died, but we would be less able to understand why. For that reason alone, it seems to me worth taking the risk of putting his story on stage. • Based on Gitta Sereny's book Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth, David Edgar's play Albert Speer is in repertoire at the National Theatre from 15 May to 8 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/may/02/tvandradio.television3","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-01T23:50:10Z","webTitle":"Back from the dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/may/02/tvandradio.television3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/may/02/tvandradio.television3","fields":{"headline":"Back from the dead","bodyText":"Last night I dreamed I returned to Southfork again. Nothing was changed. The bijou pool where bodies were frequently found floating. The windswept patio where Raoul and Teresa, the speechless Latino help, tried to serve food to a family arguing too ferociously to eat. The kitchenette where Miss Ellie and Bobby discussed sending another search party out for Sue Ellen. Only the people were gone, apart from tourists marvelling at the His and Hers loos in the master bedroom. Not that any Ewing ever seemed to feel the urge. Southfork was just like the little house on the prairie except - in a gritty, new take on family life - they all hated each other. A point eerily underlined in the current production of Art, which stars not only Bobby Ewing but also John Boy Walton, proving there is life after soap. Little Lucy Ewing, for instance, is now selling toupees on TV (\"They look so natural!\") What a trouper. Dallas Night on Channel 4 celebrated the time 20 years ago when Bing Crosby's daughter shot JR. At the time, Larry Hagman was in dispute with the studio about his contract. \"I figured\", he said, \"this is the time to go for the big bucks.\" He figured right. As an estimated 350 million watched worldwide, he could have asked for the head of the studio on a platter. Patrick Duffy was tempted back from the dead when, as he put it, \"They backed up the money truck.\" This amply accounts for Bobby's smile in the shower. Presumably Channel 4 did not back up the money truck far enough for Victoria Principal, who did not appear. There was more wheeling and dealing behind the cameras than in front of them. There was no mention of the time Thames TV tried, with a noise like velcro in Valhalla, to tear Dallas away from the BBC. Steve Kanaly (Ray Krebbs) said that when Bobby died, surrounded by sobbing Ewings, \"There was nobody acting.\" There was nobody acting a lot of the time, but most of them knew a trick worth two of that. Years ahead of Hannibal Lecter, JR seemed forever licking a last delicious drop from his lips. Cliff Barnes did a world class impression of Donald Duck. Sue Ellen's face had the quality of a pool of oil, in constant mesmeric movement. And Pamela looked spectacular standing sideways. As the director, Michael Preece said (not to put too fine a point on it or, indeed, them) \"She was married to a plastic surgeon.\" It hurts your heart to see they are all grey now - except, curiously, Terry Wogan, a tireless commentator on the Southfork scene. The phenomenon lives on. There is a Southfork in Romania, the pride of a theme park. Ceausescu allowed it to be shown on TV as an indictment of capitalism. This proved counter-productive. As Larry Hagman put it \"They thought 'How come we don't live like that?' So they took him out and shot him.\" When the Yorks, plain folks from a feuding family, designed a ranch house that made you laugh, it was instantly known as Southfork. As the city guide, ending his tour of the site of another shooting in Dallas, said, \"Our country is founded on truth and justice. Hey, I hope you enjoyed it!\" Hey, yourself! I sure did. Hallmark, a company which sprang rather endearingly from greetings cards, (\"Rose's are red, Violet's are blue. So, Violet, go wash your mouth out now !\") specialises in inoffensive family viewing. No Hallmark programme is intimidatingly preceded by \"Contains nudity and obscenity From The Start.\" They make shows like Gulliver's Travels, The Tenth Kingdom and this weekend's Arabian Nights (BBC 1). Arabs invented the cliffhanger. As Sheherazade said to the Sultan (not so much a psycho, more upset in this version) when Aladdin rubbed his magic lamp, \"Tomorrow night! Wait for tomorrow night!\" Magic is more difficult to conjure in the home than in the orange-scented darkness of what used to be called a picture palace, where I once heard Tony Curtis say \"Yondah lies da palace of my foddah, da sheikh!\" And believed him. Arabian Nights was lavish entertainment, with some good actors, mostly lost in whiskers, excellent effects like the flying carpet, and sly lines woven in to amuse the adults. It also gave honest employment to half of Morocco and every living turban maker. Hallmark now has its own channel on Sky Digital from May 1st, the pièce de resistance being Cleopatra. It is not bad, but not bad enough to be amusing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/may/02/eu.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-02T02:06:20Z","webTitle":"End of the affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/02/eu.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/may/02/eu.politics","fields":{"headline":"End of the affair","bodyText":"Not long ago France and Germany were the motor driving the European Union, the joint force that kept the show on the road. But now the engine is sputtering dangerously and may even grind to a halt. Look back over the past half-century: Europe without these old enemies at its heart is impossible to imagine. Since the first attempts at integration with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, the desperate need for reconciliation between France and Germany pulled others in their wake. From Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle, Helmut Schmidt and Giscard D'Estaing, through to Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand, the partnership allowed the countries on either side of the Rhine to transcend their traditional and destructive fixation on each other in a task which \"embedded the bilateral issue in a project larger than both\". It also allowed France to play a role to which it could no longer aspire on its own - of being arbiter of Europe and and first among equals. Links were institutionalised by the Elysée Treaty in 1963. Two decades later, with the former French minister Jacques Delors running the European Commission, the decision to launch the euro put the two countries' joint commitment to integration above their own national interest - at least in the short term. Under President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder it has been a different story. The engine's reduced pulling power is in creasingly apparent. Romano Prodi, president of the commission, has publicly urged both to rev up. This was the response from the Quai d'Orsay last month: \"From our point of view, the French-German motor is necessary but it is not sufficient to make Europe progress\". Paris, not so coyly, is playing hard to get. In a fundamental way, the Franco-German relationship is the victim of its own success. Peace is simply taken for granted. And so much so that ordinary Frenchmen were far ahead of their government in supporting German unification. Basics changed when the Berlin Wall came down. Germany, though still seriously hobbled by its past, suddenly became the more powerful of the two allies. Divergences over the collapse of Yugoslavia were one symptom of this. In both countries too, old-style national interest has reasserted itself increasingly over the last decade. The trade-off between French agri culture and German industry now barely exists. Chirac's nuclear testing in the Pacific caused outrage on the other side of the Rhine in 1995. Last year Schröder, never keen on swapping the deutschmark for the euro, balked openly at having to pay more for the EU budget under Agenda 2000. Since the launch of the single currency, there has been no big project to unite Paris and Berlin. Enlargement, the most ambitious item on the EU agenda, is a source of division. Germany, though worried about Polish farmers and Hungarian pollution, is deeply committed to expanding the number of members. France, by contrast, is still more interested in the southern Mediterranean and the Maghreb. Personalities matter too. Kohl's departure was the loss of a man of European vision. France's socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, is less enthusiastic about Europe than his predecessors. President Chirac, his partner (and rival) in cohabitation, operates in mainstream Gaullist tradition and is bored at EU summits. No surprise then that France's turn at the EU's rotating presidency, which begins this July, is awaited elsewhere in Europe with some trepidation. Important divergences exist over social policy. Schröder, stung by criticism from within the Social Democrats, has backed away from his Blairite-sounding Neue Mitte, but he is still more interested in a third way than Jospin, embattled over tax and pension reforms. Both countries were conspicuous by their absence from last month's Lisbon \"dot.com summit\", failing to even issue a common strategy paper. France opposed further privatisation of public sector utilities - a key element of the so-called new economy. All of which is good for the United Kingdom. Tony Blair's pro-European posture - especially on defence - has been boosted by shrewd tactical alliances with Spain, Portugal and Belgium. The UK still devotes more attention in foreign policy terms to France and Germany than other EU members. But the smaller fry are getting a look-in too. Yet this is not just about hogging the limelight at summits. The absence of a powerful motor is being felt. Prodi's troubles after a lacklustre start in his first months in the commission are attributed to the glaring lack of Franco-German interest or support as well as his own rambling style (and a penchant for Anglo-Saxon modes of thinking about the economy). It was no accident that the loudest mutterings - including tantalising suggestions of perfidious plotting by Brits Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten - were made with a heavy German accent. Brussels officials see clearly that an EU traditionally dominated by two countries has become a much more complicated creature. The motor has not conked out. Paris and Berlin are working together on institutional reform - majority voting, the number of commissioners, etc - made urgent by the demands of enlargement. These will be decided in the Treaty of Nice in December, but the outcome depends on hard work rather than the magic of a fading love. The UK has been quick to seize on the change, trumpeting what one senior Whitehall official called a \"tectonic shift\" to a different, more polygamous union. Alliances matter, but the ties that the euro binds matter more. Blair looks increasingly lonely on that front.

Without coming on all \"heavy\", how can I persuade them to get some physical exercise - at the moment, they seem to view this with something approaching disgust! John Matthews is chief executive of the Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom. The key is to get youngsters involved in exercise as young as possible - and for them to see it as a fun, enjoyable way to spend their time. The best way is to keep it simple, and involve the whole family. Too often it is tempting to overlook the basics in pursuit of the \"organised\" activity. What about a walk in the local park, woods or along the beach? How about hopping on your bikes for the afternoon? Is there anywhere for a football to be kicked around or a tennis ball chucked about safely? These are all straightforward, cheap and accessible ways of getting your \"couch potatoes\" outside and active. Positive attitudes stay with us - physical activity is fun! It is an unfortunate fact of life that many parents/guardians feel uncomfortable about letting their children out unaccompanied, due to fears over strangers and traffic. But this just makes it all the more compelling for you to go out as a family to enjoy some exercise. Studies have proved that seeing one or both parents/guardians exercising in some way has a positive effect on children towards getting active themselves. And don't forget it doesn't have to be regimented - savour the spontaneity of a sunny spring day and all go for a walk, or provide opportunities for your children to simply mess about outside. This could be before tea/supper, bath time, or some other set activity so that playing becomes a period of free and independent time for your children, and enjoyable for that very reason alone. This way you can gently lead your children into exercise as a leisure pursuit, not a chore. As an association, we try to push the message that providing good quality, enjoyable opportunities for children when they are very young will make it a lot easier to encourage them when they are teenagers to continue in some kind of exercise. It is a message that we would hope physical education departments in schools are also promoting. It may be worth investigating what is offered at your son's/daughter's school in terms of sports clubs. Help to make it easier for your child to attend any that they show even the vaguest interest in - or less easy for them to make an excuse not to go! For example, perhaps offer to collect them afterwards, but don't be too heavy about it. Try to keep your approach as casual as possible. After all, your child - especially if he/she is a teenager - may well feel that it is rather \"uncool\" to go to a sports club, and mum or dad openly encouraging them may well confirm this! If this is not an option, investigate the possibilities at your local sports or leisure club. They may well do \"taster\" courses on a range of sports - many of which might not be available in schools - and if you can afford it these are an excellent way for children to explore their interests. Some also run \"turn up and play\" sessions. These are very informal. No special kit or equipment is necessary, nor long-term commitment to a training programme, etc. Your local sports development officer would also be able to suggest what unusual activities are available in your area. For example, indoor rock climbing is an increasingly popular activity, and can often appeal to those youngsters for whom the more traditional sports are a bit of a turn-off. In general, think beyond the \"norm\" and go with the interests of your children. Something like an adventure holiday will not make up for a year's inactivity, of course, but it could spark the imagination of your child and prompt them to get involved in a club when they get home. For those who are not very interested in team games, but who would benefit from a sense of team spirit, see whether your school or a local youth centre are involved in the Duke of Edinburgh scheme. But, remember, it doesn't need to be expensive or complicated - and it is most successful if exercise is encouraged at a young age and becomes a family event. Next week's query: We've given in to our children's badgering and bought a computer, but worry that our children won't get the most out of the internet. We know there are lots of educational websites, but don't know where to look for them. We don't want our kids to use the internet as a shortcut to complete homework, etc. Can you offer any useful guidelines on this?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2000/may/02/thefiver.sport","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-02T16:27:31Z","webTitle":"Lord, Loud and Lucky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/02/thefiver.sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/may/02/thefiver.sport","fields":{"headline":"Lord, Loud and Lucky","bodyText":"VIN IT TO WIN IT \"I'm here. And I can save you.\" Not the words of the son of God, but Vinnie Jones who wants to return after 40 days in the wilderness (well QPR and Hollywood) to lead Wimbledon to the promised land of Premiership survival. According to Vinnie, \"Terry Burton is a nice bloke, and has a good soccer brain, but he is a natural number two, not the type you need to lead at this stage.\" So who, pray, is the right man for the job? Why it's Vinnie (although Roy Kinnear and Fash can help out if they want). The Fiver, like the other 172 Dons fans around the world, is ready to believe him, but we need evidence of miracles before we commit our souls. Vinnie decides to talk tactics. \"I would recall Neil Ardley,\" he says pointing the finger menacingly in a Presbyterian minister-like way. \"Surely not the same Neil Ardley who played on Sunday?\" wonders the Fiver, cowering in the corner. \"And I would get Michael Hughes, Carl Cort and Jason Euell in the side.\" But didn't they all play on Sunday as well, oh holy one? \"And I would put Marcus Gayle centre-half to combat Dion Dublin against Aston Villa.\" Err praise be to God, we are convinced!!! Remembering that it is easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, Vinnie has even offered to take a pay cut: \"I'd take £200,000 as thanks.\" Furthermore, he seems to have the support of the players: \"John Hartson phoned me and said the players would love it,\" he reveals. But a dour-faced club spokesman has poured cold water on the whole idea. \"Vinnie Jones has already named his price for coming as manager. In contrast Terry Burton never mentioned money once when he was offered the job. Vinnie would be better served concentrating on his showbiz career rather than exploiting the situation at the club he claims still to care about.\" Vinnie, the man needs more convincing.

The permanently crocked Spurs striker would not have been chuffed to have limped down to the newsagents this morning and found that \"£10m Rebrov says yes to Spurs\". But barely had the technically questionable forward had chance to digest the imminent arrival of one of Europe's top strikers before David Pleat came out and to reveal that \"Nothing has been finalised yet.\" So what, Les may have muttered as he scuffled back to his flat, is going on? It seems that the most plausible way of looking at events is this. Spurs, again without manager George Graham, produce a poor performance at home. Their fans decide to complain, for once in their lives, and hang around the ground demanding Alan Sugar goes back to Chigwell (he was in Miami at the time). At the same time crucial contract negotiations with club captain Sol Campbell and top scorer Steffen Iversen are approaching. 48 hours later and one of the hottest properties in Europe is on his way to a club that won't be in Europe next season. So either Alan Sugar has pulled off the transfer coup of the summer, or somebody's making something up. Who knows which is true (apart from Internazionale, AC Milan, Arsenal and Real Madrid, all of whom are in the chase for Rebrov)? But let's face it, it's about time Sugar got a break. As spokesman Pleat said today: \"It is not true that we are reluctant spenders.\" Indeed. \"We do want to invest in quality players but our problem in the transfer market has been selling. We have struggled to move on some of the moderate ability that was brought to the club a few years ago.\" Shame on you, Sir Les. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Mr Wenger was a good coach.

Yes, former Real Madrid and Dutch national coach Guus Hiddink is now available to take over the reins of Parkhead. Because he's been sacked by Spanish relegation candidates Real Betis. In a move that brought joy to every hooped-sweater-wearer in Glasgow (apart from the city's burglars, who may or may not care less), Betis gave Hiddink the boot today after a two-month spell at the club. In this time the Dutchman promised European qualification and effectively achieved the opposite - winning only one match in 13 league games. Betis have yet to announce Hiddink's replacement, presumably feeling that anyone, or indeed no one, is as good as Guus. Hiddink has been the long time favourite for the manager's (whipping) post at Celtic. He is thought to have the qualities that will enable the Bhoys to compete with Dick Advocaat's Rangers: ie an in-depth knowledge of Dutch players who can be bought on the cheap. After today's developments it appears that the only thing hindering Hiddink's move to Glasgow is his reportedly sizeable contract demands.

Until then a crowd of warriors, priests and temple maidens (the bayadères) are rather boringly busy with a bit of old-fashioned fire worship. Zakharova changes the pace and the audience is immediately seduced. Making its Scottish debut this week the Kirov, under the youthful directorship of Makhar Vaziev, brings new blood and a rare elegance to a ballet that essentially belongs to the company. Programme notes remind us that La Bayadère, a simple story of love lost and found, set exotically in India, was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre (the Kirov's home) in St Petersburg in 1877 as an extravagant royal entertainment. By rights, it is a museum piece. And the Kirov to some extent seems bound by that - the costumes are high on eastern promise, the sets have that slightly highbrow but dusty look and the format respectfully recreates the classic set pieces. These include crowds, swoony duets, death scenes, folk dance diversions and the little jokey interlude (here, a papier- mache elephant carrying our hero, followed by a tatty tiger trophy). The trappings are traditional, the music by Minkus strangely unmemorable, so what clicks? The dancing itself. On the whole it is good; in parts it is ravishing. The Kirov has allowed much attention to be lavished on its younger proteges, who revel in the sensuous, gestural Russian style inherited through the company that produced Nureyev and Baryshnikov. In the final act our heroine Nikia and her prince Sonor (played with aquiline composure by Farukh Ruzimatov) meet in the Kingdom of Shades, a deathly place. Entering one by one, 32 white tutus spiral in an ever- increasing line to fill the stage. Bend and point, bend and point, repetitively, precisely - nowhere in ballet is the tutu more triumphant as it frames these slowly moving limbs sculpted to perfection by Petipa's choreography. Startlingly close to the rhythms and abstraction of much late 20th-century ballet, this scene is exactingly executed by the Kirov. The ballerinas even seem to breathe collectively as they create their kaleidoscopic patterns across the floor. Soloists in this act also cut shapely figures, thrilling the audience with their complex simplicity. Put all that postmodern irony behind you, and this might just be a new experience."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/2000/may/04/smoking","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-04T00:11:23Z","webTitle":"Smugglers net £2bn for tobacco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/04/smoking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/04/smoking","fields":{"headline":"Smugglers net £2bn for tobacco","bodyText":"Tobacco smuggling is now second only to drugs in terms of consumer spending on illegal activities, according to a report published yesterday. The Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, which commissioned the report, described as \"breathtaking\" the scale of criminal activity and the government's failure to deal with it. The study, carried out by the independent consultants DTZ Pieda, claims that 16.6bn black market cigarettes, or over 830m packets, were sold illegally in the United Kingdom last year. \"At an average street price of £2.50 a pack, this equates to over £2bn in revenue for the smugglers and estimated untaxed profits of £415m,\" the report said. \"Add further profits of £123m from the £430m illegal sales of hand-rolling tobacco and it is not hard to see why organised crime has moved in on this lucrative and relatively risk-free business.\" And the report predicted that if cigarette smuggling expanded to the level of hand-rolling tobacco, revenue losses could rise to over £11bn by 2005. \"With estimated sales of £2.5bn a year, tobacco smuggling is now second only to drugs in terms of consumer spending on illegal activities,\" the report said. It also claimed that customs and excise managed to seize only a small proportion of all tobacco smuggled into the UK from Belgium and elsewhere. It concluded that if the government was to stamp out this black market it must: • Reduce the tobacco tax differential between Britain and the rest of Europe; • Restrict the quantity of cigarettes that can be legally imported for personal use; and • Make stiffer penalties for tobacco smugglers.

A corps of cleaners, workmen and ballet-dancers swept through the working areas before last Thursday's opening night, the first performance in England for 17 years by the Paris Opera Ballet. They brought Rudolf Nureyev's spectacular version of La Bayadère, his last production for the company before his death in 1993. The ballet, which shows off the dancers in depth, also serves to display the theatre that frames it. The Lowry's Lyric boasts the largest stage in Britain outside London. Its purple auditorium perfectly offsets La Bayadère 's glowing oriental costumes in Balinese blues, saffron yellow and crimson. The Hallé Orchestra played Minkus's 1877 score (reworked by John Lanchbery) under the baton of Vello Pähn, director of the Paris Opera Orchestra when Nureyev's production was first mounted. The Hallé gave Minkus good value, enabling him to be poignant instead of rum-ti-tum. For all that La Bayadère is set in India, there is nothing authentically eastern in music or dance. This production, with designs by Ezio Frigerio, drawn from ancient monuments in the Ottoman and Indian empires, is an exotic fantasy for stay-at-homes stuck in a cold climate. Nureyev retrieved numbers that Russian choreographers had added over the century or so since the ballet's St Petersburg premiere, including a solo of his own making for the hero, Solor. He could not supply the missing final act for the ballet, however, so it ends, as did the Kirov's production, with Solor's vision of the Kingdom of the Shades, set in a tropical paradise garden. The Paris Opera Ballet's dancers were not as spectacularly accurate as the Kirov at their best. La Bayadère is part of an eclectic POB repertoire rather than a signature ballet, and the refinements of Nureyev's coaching before his last illness seem to be dissipating. The 32 bayadères in the Kingdom of the Shades were militarily abrupt, the soloists (and their tempi) unyielding. This was hardly a transcendent experience, especially with a Nikiya seemingly incapable of forgiveness. Agnès Letestu is Darcey Bussell's age and height, though her career has not been as fast-track. An inner restraint limits her appeal; she lacks confidence in lifts, although her technique is beautifully unforced. Her Nikiya looks emotionally damaged from the start - no contest for her ruthless rival, Gamzatti, danced with imperious glee by Aurélie Dupont. Jean-Guillaume Bart, the company's newest étoile , seemed to have little problem in choosing between them. He acts with his cheekbones and dances academically, rather than with the fire Nureyev imparted to his immediate successors. Not the greatest performance by the Paris Opera Ballet, then, but a flawless debut for the Lowry Centre's main theatre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/07/northernireland.henrymcdonald","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-06T23:41:33Z","webTitle":"IRA agrees to open up its weapons dumps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/07/northernireland.henrymcdonald","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/07/northernireland.henrymcdonald","fields":{"headline":"IRA agrees to open up its weapons dumps","bodyText":"The IRA took the historic step yesterday of agreeing to open its arsenals to inspection, generating a wave of optimism that the Irish peace process was back on track. The republicans said arms dumps could be inspected at regular intervals by agreed representatives of an international decommissioning body to prove that weapons were not being used. A statement by the group, whose previous refusal to begin disarmament led to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, said that 'in the context of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement', the IRA was willing to put its arms 'completely and verifiably beyond use'. The weapons would be dumped in 'such a way as to avoid risks to the public or misappropriation by others' - an apparent reference to dissident hardline republicans such as the Real IRA. The noon announcement came after Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, put forward new proposals that they said could allow a restoration of the suspended Assembly and a return to devolved rule for the six counties. The offer came late on Friday night after more than 30 hours of talks between the two heads of government. Following the IRA's announcement, the Government confirmed that the crucial 22 May deadline by which the decommissioning process was supposed to be completed will be postponed for a year. This means the Assembly can resume work on that date, if David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, can win the support of the 860-strong ruling council of his party for its participation. Blair and Ahern welcomed the IRA statement, and announced that former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and former African National Congress secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa would lead the inspections of the IRA weapons dumps. Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said the IRA move 'offers the opportunity to restart the institutions on a firmer footing than before'. The Conservative Party also gave the breakthrough a cautious welcome. But reactions from the Northern Irish Unionist community were mixed. Trimble said: 'There are some interesting things in this statement. It does appear to break new ground. There are some... very positive aspects but there are also some questions we have already raised with people that we want to just tease out.' He did not elaborate. David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, said: 'We have from the IRA a better appreciation of intent than has ever hitherto been the case. We've got an opportunity here at our fingertips that we dare not throw away.' Others rejected the deal outright. Robert McCartney, hardline leader of the United Kingdom Unionist Party, claimed Blair's position represented the 'ultimate surrender' to all IRA demands. Loyalist paramilitaries, such as the Ulster Volunteer Force, have yet to respond. John Hume, the SDLP leader, welcomed what he called 'a very positive statement from the IRA'. He said: 'I think it is making very clear that the gun has been taken out of Irish politics for ever.' Observers said the IRA move is a radical step forward. With it, the Provisionals have given up a 300-year tradition of armed resistance to British rule in Ireland. The statement is the clearest indication so far that for the bulk of the IRA the 30-year-old war is over. However no one can be sure how many hardliners were opposed to yesterday's announcement. There is a potential danger for the Sinn Fein leadership. Hardline republicans will paint this initiative as a sell-out, so a serious split in the ranks of armed Republicanism could follow. This shift in mainstream Republican thinking marks another stage in the evolution of the Provisionals from the violent revolutionary movement of 1969 towards a democratic constitutional Irish nationalist political force. At the start of the present Northern Ireland troubles, IRA members refused even to recognise the validity of the courts in which they were tried for terrorist offences. As late as the Eighties, the IRA's political allies, Sinn Fein, ran its absentionist Assembly election campaign with the slogan, 'Smash Stormont.' Yet 20 years later many of those committed to the movement appear to have given up armed struggle to ensure that Stormont, with Sinn Fein's participation, is restored. Yesterday's statement comes after weeks of secret negotiations. Dozens of alternative solutions were floated by the two governments to break the impasse. Three weeks ago The Observer revealed the basis of the plan envisaged to save the Good Friday Agreement. This was: * An IRA statement that the war was over for good. * The Government accepting that it would re-establish the Executive. * The IRA then giving Trimble's party a specific time frame for when the weapons would be put beyond use. * The Unionists would then agree to go back into coalition government with Sinn Fein. In fact, the IRA statement goes further than Trimble's UUP could have hoped for, by agreeing to let a third party inspect their arms dumps. However, Unionists have pointed out that the IRA is still only referring to a 'cessation' of violence and has not yet renounced violence.The organisation's credibility has also been damaged by continuing punishment beatings on the streets of Northern Ireland cities. The final act preceding this huge change seems to have been a meeting that took place within the past four weeks in Dublin between senior members of the Irish government and the IRA itself. The Observer has been told that Bertie Ahern was involved in direct discussions with the IRA, in an attempt to break through the enormous suspicion felt by republicans after the suspension of the Executive. The key to the agreement appears to have been a telephone conversation between Mandelson and his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, on 12 February. However, sources close the Northern Ireland secretary said even the Government was surprised by the concessions in the IRA statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/may/07/onlinesecurity.efinance","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-07T13:54:12Z","webTitle":"If e-friendly is as e-friendly does, who's a right e-jit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/may/07/onlinesecurity.efinance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/may/07/onlinesecurity.efinance","fields":{"headline":"If e-friendly is as e-friendly does, who's a right e-jit?","bodyText":"Six years ago, someone (identity unknown) opened an Internet account with Prodigy, a US Internet services provider, in the name of 'Alexander Lunney'. Having registered, this person then posted vulgar messages on bulletin boards and sent a threatening e-mail message to another individual. The recipient was not amused and summoned the cops. The fuzz promptly descended upon one Alexander Lunney, who at that time was a 15-year-old Bronxville high school student. Shortly after that, young Lunney received a letter from Prodigy's lawyers, informing him that the company had decided to terminate his account 'due to the transmission of obscene, abusive, threatening and sexually explicit material'. The only problem was that the lad was not, and never had been, a Prodigy customer and it was rapidly established that whoever had opened the account in his name was an impostor. At this point, Lunney sued Prodigy, and matters passed into the hands of m'learned friends. A succession of local and district courts then ruled that the service provider was not legally culpable for either the objectionable e-mail or the bulletin board message. 'Prodigy was not a publisher of the e-mail transmitted through its system by a third party,' was the unanimous judgment of the New York Court of Appeals. 'We are unwilling to deny Prodigy the common-law qualified privilege accorded to telephone and telegraph companies.' The judgment said that Prodigy could not be treated as publisher of the electronic bulletin board message and concluded that 'the public would not be well served by compelling an Internet service provider to examine and screen millions of e-mail communications, on pain of liability for defamation'. The Lunney case eventually reached the US Supreme Court. On Monday last, the court upheld the ruling of the lower courts. So the position is that, under US law, Internet service providers cannot be held legally liable for material that is published by third parties through their servers. Given the nature of the Internet, and the key role played in it by ISPs, that is an eminently sensible state of affairs. Now spool forward a few years, and cross the Atlantic to a small island off the shores of continental Europe. The rulers of this quaint kingdom know about as much about the Internet as the average trouser press, but this doesn't stop them being most awfully keen on it. Their leader continually gushes about 'the Net' and they even declare on their gleaming new website (called e-commerce@its.best.uk, if you please) their goal of 'developing the UK as the best place in the world for e-commerce by 2002'. A resident of this ancient land, one Laurence Godfrey, complained to an ISP called Demon Internet that some messages posted about him on Internet discussion groups carried by Demon (and thousands of other ISPs worldwide) were defamatory. Demon declined to remove the offending newsgroups from its circulation system, and Mr Godfrey sued for libel. In the end, Demon decided not to fight the case and settled out of court, paying Mr Godfrey substantial damages and costs. As a result, the legal position in the UK is that ISPs are legally responsible for the stuff that passes through their servers. Are the country's Internet-savvy rulers wringing their hands over this and planning to revise the law of libel to protect ISPs from actions for defamation? Are they hell. Au contraire: they are gleefully proposing (through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill currently being railroaded through Parliament) to impose on them the enormous costs of the large-scale surveillance of private e-mail that the Bill requires ISPs to facilitate. So here's your starter for 10. Which country - the US or the UK - is more e-friendly? Do not write on both sides of the paper at once.

But now after false dawns, the frustration of suspension, we are finally moving into a better future. Last Friday the two governments made a commitment to revive the assembly and the executive. On Saturday, in response to that commitment, the IRA stated that they would put their arms beyond use, completely and verifiably. How the parties respond will shape Northern Ireland forever. A positive response means nothing less than this: a future which guarantees political inclusion - government by the people for the people. A future free from violence, free from the tyranny of guns. It is an irony that Northern Ireland, once the object of in tense scrutiny and sharp criticism, is now transforming itself into a world leader in the protection and promotion of human rights. The outcast is becoming a model - one for others not to condemn, but to emulate. In the two years since it was brokered the Good Friday agreement has given us a new human rights commission - potentially a radical and groundbreaking body, the depth and weight of whose work I hope will grow. From the Good Friday agreement has flowed reform of the RUC, to help them to make the transition from a security force to a community-based policing service, with the protection of human rights as its guiding principle. And the agreement goes further. Its constitutional structures have the potential entirely to redefine the relationship between the people of Northern Ireland and their government: it actively seeks to bring government and citizen's closer together. Because democracy and rights go hand in hand. It is drawing a new political landscape in which lively, constructive debate on the bread and butter issues that really matter eclipses the old, sterile politics of blame and counter-blame. But this is a long revolution. I would be naive if I did not recognise that this is only the start of the process of reconciliation. There are still wounds that will not heal on the stroke of midnight when we are able to restore devolved government: • The paramilitary attacks that inflict terrible injuries. They have nothing to do with justice and everything to do with keeping communities divided and in fear. They have to stop if the ceasefires are to live up to their name and protestations of peace are to have any meaning. And that is a message I deliver today to all the paramilitary organisations. • The arson attacks that wreck homes and wreck lives. • Contentious parades. We cannot place a sticking- plaster over these sores and hope that they go away. Because the problems - and the answers - lie in the very bedrock of this country. Northern Ireland has rich traditions across both communities. Too often these traditions have had their image sullied by the insolent demands of a few for rights that cut across the rights of the many. But I believe that at their best these traditions make Northern Ireland what it is - a vibrant, creative society capable of great tolerance and inclusivity. I want to build on, not suppress these traditions. I want to see a society which celebrates its diversity. A society in which Orange and Green can live side by side in mutual respect, as keen to protect each other's rights as their own. But I know that those of us whose duty it is to ensure that rights are upheld equally across the community will be judged on what we achieve, not what we aspire towards. On how we dispense rights and how we handle competing claims. And on our treatment of symbols. We must have the sensitivity to understand that upholding the rights of one group - however well meaning our intervention - can cut across the rights of others. Part of my job is to weigh competing interests. To make fine judgments and meet the - often very personal - criticism head on. There has to be a sensitive use of symbols on both sides. One that recognises the equally legitimate identities and aspirations of both communities. That underscores the principle of consent that lies at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, and the legitimacy of Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom while a majority wishes it. Because this society is united by a shared language, shared values and shared land. And those bonds are strong enough to encompass diversity of religion, of politics and of custom. And in return the message is clear: this is a two-way street. All citizens must shoulder the same responsibility for the health of that society. Inequality has blighted community relations and marred individual lives. It has left people alienated, feeling that they owe nothing to the wider community. And this is why we, the politicians, keep pressing on. The people of Northern Ireland have the right to live in a modern democracy. Peter Mandelson is secretary of state for Northern Ireland.

Prisoners and their lawyers are preparing to challenge prison service policies and practices right across the board - yet the prison service has published an astonishing document advising its 41,000 or so employees that the best thing they can do is to stick their heads in the sand. Governors and their staff - and, indeed, the courts - are anticipating a rash of litigation come this autumn. Jane Kennedy, junior minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, forecasts a doubling in the number of applications for judicial review. Many of those applications, as at present, will be from serving prisoners. They tend to be litigious for, as Sir Stephen Tumim, former chief inspector of prisons, once wrote: \"A prisoner, as a result of being in prison, is particularly vulnerable to arbitrary and unlawful action.\" The prison service, however, states: \"We believe that none of our policies need to be changed... Existing instructions accord with the act and must continue to be followed. In this sense, the Human Rights Act does not change our operating framework in any way.\" The family of Zahid Mubarek, who died in March following an attack while he was in Feltham young offenders institution, or those of the dozens of suicide victims from within the prison population every year, might think that the positive duty to ensure the right to life, under the act, had in some way been infringed. Those allegedly assaulted by the 27 Wormwood Scrubs staff presently suspended, or those handcuffed while giving birth or while in a hospice bed, might argue that they had been subjected to \"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\", which is prohibited by the act. Prisoners located hundreds of miles from their homes, or denied conjugal visits or artificial insemination, or those in mother and baby units eventually separated from their children, might assert an infringement of their right to family life. Those whose letters are routinely read by prison staff might perceive a lack of respect for correspondence and seek the act's protection. Prisoners who face internal disciplinary proceedings, without legal representation, before a governor who can impose up to 42 additional days' imprisonment, will contend that such hearings are not before \"an independent and impartial tribunal\". The same might be said by staff about their disciplinary hearings. Prisoners like Ian Simms and Michael O'Brien, who maintain that they were wrongly convicted of murder and who took their cases to the House of Lords since their access to journalists was inhibited or forbidden, will challenge the curtailment of their right to freedom of expression. The act affords the right to elections \"which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people\". But convicted prisoners are disenfranchised - a prohibition which may itself be declared incompatible with convention rights under section 4 of the act. Lord Bassam, Home Office minister in the Lords, recently told the House that such prisoners had forfeited \"the moral right\" to vote - a view unlikely to hold sway with the courts after October. And there will be many more challenges. There are some people - prison service officials among them - who find reassurance in the historically conservative attitude of the judges when dealing with prisoners' rights. But they ignore the words of Lord Leigh in the 1998 debate on the act at bill stage. He asserted that \"this is a new bill of rights, based on the Convention. United Kingdom judges can, and I believe will, go much further than the Convention.\" Likewise, writing in the Guardian on April 20, Hugo Young predicted a judiciary required \"to go beyond the letter of the arid statute and investigate its connection with larger principles.\" If prisons are unprepared for the act, they are certainly unprepared for judges who might go further than it requires. The prison service advice is that: \"If changes are thought necessary, new prison service instructions will be issued.\" Anxious governors will, no doubt, hope that such instructions will be issued well before prisoners' claims start to pile up on their desks in less than six months' time. • Frank Michael worked in prisons for 20 years and is now a freelance writer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/may/11/efinance.freespeech","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-11T00:18:01Z","webTitle":"Saudis claim victory in war for control of web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/may/11/efinance.freespeech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/may/11/efinance.freespeech","fields":{"headline":"Saudis claim victory in war for control of web","bodyText":"There are now many internet cafes - constructed to keep male and female surfers apart - and around 30 commercial internet service providers, but the apparent range of choice belies the fact that all traffic passes through the King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology in Riyadh, which is the country's only link to the web. For a wealthy country, Saudi Arabia may appear slow in adopting the internet but, in the words of Saleh Abdulrahman al-Adhel, the president of the KACST, the kingdom was waiting until the technology was available to ban access to \"material that corrupts or that harms our Muslim values, tra dition, and culture\". The Saudis are not alone in their fears. Other governments have tried to block internet access using cruder methods. The Chinese, for example, have tried to restrict access to modems. The director of the Saudi government's internet monitoring system, Dr Fahad al-Hoymany, says he believes his team are blocking all major pornographic sites. Saad Fagih, of the exiled opposition Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, testifies to the system's effectiveness and says millions of other websites have been blocked, including \"all the hot political sites, such as Amnesty International\". Computer industry sources say the Saudis' system works in two ways. First, it caches all approved web pages in a 500-gigabyte storage system. Users get these sites from the computer in Riyadh rather than the original source on the web. This means that frequently-used pages can be accessed quickly without the system having to check their suitability each time. Requests for pages that are not stored in the cache are passed to the second stage of the system, supplied by a US-based company, Websense, which lists and can filter out 30 categories of potentially unsuitable sites. Experts concede that these filters are imperfect. One said: \"You're always half a step behind because of the growth and change of the internet.\" Another said: \"Filter systems are very difficult to administer and are likely to over-censor - for example cutting out information about breast cancer or Aids in order to exclude sex sites.\" Saudi opposition sources say that despite the filtering, government control of internet use is more fragile than it might appear. They say some cafes have illegal, direct satellite links to the internet, to which the authorities frequently turn a blind eye. Last month a women's internet cafe near to Mecca University was closed down after a complaint that it was being used for \"immoral purposes\". Individuals who want unrestricted access to the internet can, if they wish, simply obtain a service provider in a neighbouring country. While some complain that the main purpose of the filtering system is to block politically sensitive material, Dr Hoymany argues that it is designed to give assurance to Saudis that when they log on to the internet their social or religious traditions will not be offended. This suggests to some observers that the Saudis' approach to the internet may be more subtle than it appears. For a time, it was unclear what attitude strict Muslims - not only in Saudi Arabia but throughout the Islamic world - would adopt towards the internet. Perhaps surprisingly, they have taken to it with great en thusiasm, deciding that it can be a useful vehicle for spreading their message. The economic future of Saudi Arabia may depend on making full use of the internet and a filtering system which reassures conservatives may be the key to exploiting the new technology. However, Saudi Arabia's slow start may prove costly. Unlike some of its neighbours it still has neither internet banking nor a legal framework for e-commerce. Andrew Puddephatt, executive director of Article 19, the campaign against censorship, argues that government monopoly of communications, and internet monitoring and filtering, is ultimately incompatible with e-commerce. \"There's no possibility of developing e-commerce unless they allow liberalisation and the growth of independent service providers,\" he says. \"It's a choice between surrendering control and being shut off from the electronic future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/may/13/unitedkingdom.cyclingholidays.cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-13T18:18:15Z","webTitle":"Welcome to the new map of the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/may/13/unitedkingdom.cyclingholidays.cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/may/13/unitedkingdom.cyclingholidays.cycling","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to the new map of the UK","bodyText":"The National Cycle Network, chosen as a landmark project to celebrate the millennium, was funded with £42 million of Lottery money and consists of 5,000 miles of both off-road and traffic-calmed routes in Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as unmarked routes along mostly quite lanes. By 2005, a further 4,000 miles will be added and the network will be complete. This network is to do much of the work of making the UK a place in which cycling is something less than insanely dangerous and, hey, even health inducing. For those of us who daily suck down fumes as we cycle behind buses, waiting only for the moment when some clown in a white van opens his door and projects us into orbit, the growth of this network, though not in itself enough, is no bad thing. That said, it is inevitable that the National Cycle Network will primarily be a leisure facility. Most of it runs through beautiful rural districts that deserve to be savoured at a relaxed speed. The network has been designed by a small charity called Sustrans, which is short for Sustainable Transport. Typical is the new 200-mile section opening in early June called the Coast and Castles Cycle Route. It starts in Newcastle, runs along Hadrian's Wall for a stretch, then up the wonderful castly coastline of Northumbria, up and down the Tweed valley before reaching Edinburgh. This is one of the safe, attractive routes that should ideally be used in conjunction with the integrated public transport system. Which would be nice if there was one. True, many of the routes devised by Sustrans have rail connections. But that is not enough and the cumulative effect of cycle-unfriendliness on the railways is that many people feel obliged to transport their bikes by car, which is no way to carry on. But that's enough carping. Sustrans' work in negotiating with 400 councils, landowners, businesses and what can only be described as the British Railways Board to push cycle routes through this patchwork quilt of a multi-owner-occupied kingdom deserves a great deal of credit. Sustrans also deserves praise for setting up a pilot project called Safe Routes to Schools and aimed at doing something about these dreadful figures: 60% of children cycle to school in Denmark compared with 2% in Britain. Thanks to Sustrans and the city council, it is now a delight to cycle in and around Birmingham, along the industrial-archaelogical sites that line its towpaths. It's even more of a pleasure to roll into Glastonbury along the Willow Walk, a verdant artwork created by Katy Hallett. The charity has also acquired more than 200 miles of former railway routes and incorporated them into the network. It's heartening to know that a covenant ensures their possible future use as railway corridors, though, if that covenant is taken up, it's hard to know what will become of the millions of us who will be cycling along them in years to come. All of these former railways have gentle gradients which make them suitable for cycling families with young children, though not exclusively so. When I cycled from Barnstaple to Plymouth last year along the newly-opened cross-Devon route, much of which was along a disused railway, there was purple scabious around my ankles and lilac brushing my cycle helmet. If I had been any more relaxed, I would have crashed into the bushes. White Rose Route: Hull to Middlesbrough. 123 miles, easy/moderate Route 65 presses north alongside the Ouse, then through the quiet country lanes of the Vale of York, before rising up into the foothills of the North Yorkshire Moors. There's money in those hills, the kind of cash that demands that pubs in the vicinity have impressive wine lists and patrons who speak in that singular dialect, Yorkshire posh, just like William Hague. It was a lovely ride, and so well signposted that I barely needed to consult my map. I picked up the route just north of York railway station last Saturday on a sunny spring morning. Rowers were lifting their craft into a sparkling river and gardeners had emerged from a row of semis to tend the hanging gardens that step down to the Ouse. I swept on through the water meadows alongside the Ouse and past the leisurely dog walkers of this contented, cycle-friendly little city, and then under the seething outer ring road. Then I left the cycle path that runs through fields and joined a country lane near Skelton, where an evocative weather vane of cyclist and dog marked the transition. At nearby Shipton, two railway carriages have been fitted up as restaurant and hotel, but I was too busy pedalling off a thumping breakfast to patronise the Sidings Hotel in all but the most notional sense. From York to Easingwold, it's flat terrain, and consequently a little windy for the wobbling cyclist on even the stillest day. Just on from the Sidings Hotel lies the baroque pile of Beningborough Hall, a nice place for a contemplative wander if you have £3.50 about your person. \"Explore Victorian life in the Laundry and Potting Shed,\" advised the blurb , but instead I roamed the soothing gardens and the collection of more than 100 portraits from the National Portrait Gallery. They really know when to mow village greens in this part of Yorkshire. Daisies, like white Smarties sprinkled by a god with fine attention to detail, glittered at me from one such green at Newton-on-Ouse. More ruthless gardeners would have cut that green of all such interest. There was time to consider such details since this was an easy cycle. At Easingwold, though, things changed. Inclines got steeper. I was whisked, thanks to Sustrans' route, into the village's Millfields Park, opened by the mayor only last year, and then through a rinky-dink housing estate, complete with mock-Georgian carriage lamps. The ups and downs of this portion were a surprise to me. At Newburgh Priory, I saw triangular sign warning of looming ducks. It's so peaceful hereabouts that damp birds are the most prominent of traffic hazards. Mind you, they were quite burly ducks. At Coxwold, a twee village on a hill, I sank two litres of mineral water, only pausing to emit grateful noisy sighs that seemed to affront the genteel patrons of the adjacent Fauconberg Arms. At this village, Sustrans splits the route in two - a gentle low road direct to Kilburn, and the high road, which I took, that pushes deeper into the hills of the Moors. By the time I reached Byland Abbey, crossing hills and dales, I had sweated most of the water on to my skin surface, thus attracting all of the local insect life. It was time for lunch. The Abbey Inn, opposite the abbey ruins, is recommended by Egon Ronay and, to a lesser extent, me. It has a restaurant, a good wine list, a delightful garden and a very small bar. I was dehydrated and in urgent need of the sustenance that only a poached salmon sandwich and a pint of Black Sheep bitter can supply. Fed, watered and abluted, I hit the road again. The White Horse, sculpted into the moorland hills, had long been an uncertain friend, playing peek-a-boo with me as I rose and fell over the hills. At Kilburn, Sustrans offered me another choice: back down into the valley or up into the moors. It was at this point I realised that I urgently needed after-sun lotion, and so headed down towards civilisation. My arms were turning weasel red and so I customised a quick route to Thirsk railway station. I was, nonetheless, very much taken with Sowerby, whose avenues of limes and floral verges were everything they should be. At Thirsk, it was race day. As I cycled along the road parallel to the the two-furlong marker, a steel band struck up something carnivalesque that spirited me on to the station. Watch out for that right-hand turn into the ticket office, though. It's a doozy. The rail journey from Thirsk to York passed without incident. It's worth recording that all the GNER staff I encountered both on this local service and on the mainline to King's Cross were properly solicitous for me and my bike. In York, I got the attention my arms so needed. Where to visit: Beningborough Hall, Newburgh Priory (only open on Sunday and Wednesday afternoons), the White Horse at Kilburn, the ruins of Byland Abbey. Where to eat and drink: The Sidings Hotel and restaurant, The Facuonberg Inn, Coxswold. The Abbey Inn, Byland Abbey. Thames Valley: London to Oxford. 97 miles, easy/moderate I rode the Thames Valley Cycle Route from Putney Bridge to Windsor. If there were hills, my calves didn't notice them. This was never, nor was meant to be, a cardiovascular work out. There were herons who sat on the Thames path near Molesey Reservoirs and blocked my way until the last possible moment. They flapped into the air with insolent laziness before settling fatly in my path once more. I felt sure they were the psychic equivalent of sleeping policemen. \"Slow down! Slow down! You'll enjoy it more.\" That is what they would have said if they could have spoken. Admittedly, I became embroiled in a little altercation near the Ferrari outlet on the Egham by pass, and the one-way systems of places like Kingston, Staines, Weybridge and lots of other identikit towns, jolted me from my reverie back into irksome reality. At these points, where a single slip can mean a 20-mile detour around Slough, the Sustrans map of the cycle route became hot in my hands. It proved very easy to follow, colourful, waterproof, and with smart inserts on how to get through commuter town centres without upset. The only problem with fold-up maps for on-the-go cyclist, to my mind, is that after a little bit of folding and unfolding, a tear always emerges at the vital corner. Much better, surely, to print the maps in little ring binders, as for example they have done with the Hayes London Cycle Guide. If I'd had a ring binder for a map, that whole Egham debacle, I am certain, could have been avoided. As I cycled these 40-odd miles, I felt protected from the traffic roar all around me. Sustrans has created a route that is a miracle of calm, though north of Windsor there is not yet a quiet path through the dismal jungle of Heathrow buildings and motorways. But even along the Putney to Windsor stretch, 747s are always with us. Only they interrupt the serenity. From Putney, the route took me along the Thames path for a little while, then nipped through Barnes's interesting collection of Toucan crossings and cycle lanes, before switching, delightfully, into Richmond Park, where it proved necessary to stop for the first of series of unhealthy snacks at Pembroke Lodge. A Toucan crossing, it turns out, is like a Pelican crossing for bikes. The park route forms a by-pass around Richmond. As a result, I missed one more English one-way system and Quinlan Terry's Prince Charles-approved retro riverfront development, for both of which, Sustrans, much thanks. After Richmond Park, I rejoined the Thames and swept through Teddington, where Magpie was filmed. Then I fringed Hampton Court Park. I hugged the Thames path tight as we swept through the badlands of the commuter belt. I have watched my Ali G, after all, and know that the feud between the West Staines and East Staines massives means that they regularly get medieval on eachothers' bottoms and, perhaps, on those of passing cyclists. This is an overdetermined corner of England, where heritage history does battle with a frenzied suburban aspiration and just about survives, but only thanks to the suburbanite need to express its collective Englishness through frequenting cream-tea joints and wandering through courtly fields to stately homes. There was almost too much history to take in. I found Runnymede, for instance, too replete with suggestion: the Magna Carta Tea Room, on Windsor Road, for instance. Nonetheless, I rolled my bike deferentially through the meadows where King John met 25 rebellious barons and placed his reluctant seal on the articles that became the Magna Carta. I strove to feel what the Ameri can Bar Association felt when they erected the Magna Carta Memorial on a hill overlooking the meadows in 1957. Or what the government felt in 1963 when it gave over one acre of Runnymede to the US to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. At the Kennedy monument in this little bit of America, I removed my cycle helmet. After Runnymede, I stopped for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Bishopsgate on the fringes of Windsor Great Park. This has a nice garden for a well-earned sit, and is a good place to reflect on the equestrian culture that thrives royally around here. Then I descended from the tranquil heights of Windsor Great Park to Windsor Castle, that jewel in the crown of multiple fudge concessions, gourmet coffee shops and souvenir emporia. At the Theatre Royal opposite the Queen's pad, they are staging a new musical called Hard Times. Fudge-sated tourists and complacent locals mingled in the queues to hear the evils of Victorian capitalism expressed in easeful song. History has become harmless here and even our ancestors' sufferings are sold back to us for fun. I cycled on to the station, eager to leave. Where to eat and drink: Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park. Magna Carta Tea Rooms, Runnymede. The Fox and Hounds, Bishopsgate. Cycling essentials What to wear · Loose clothing that allows freedom of movement is essential. Short, tight T-shirts, for instance, may look fetching, but they will result in an ugly sunburned rim in the small of your back. Trust me. Lycra, for some, is just the thing, though gentlemen who favour very tight Lycra shorts might do well to reflect that children and horses are easily disturbed by such sights. · Waterproof tops and trousers are a necessity. They roll up small in your pannier and are extremely light. Forget them and it will rain hard and you will be very miserable. Gore-Tex is a good breathable material. · Gloves. The wind and rain numb your knuckles, and if you take a tumble you are very likely to graze your hands. Gloves can help in both cases, though perhaps not knitted ones. · Helmet. Most of the routes on the National Cycle Network involve tricky little on-road switchbacks during which white van men and boy racers will try to put you in casualty. A helmet will help frustrate them and, to my mind, looks quite stylish. What to take · Accessories. You will need a pump, a puncture-repair kit and a spare inner tube. The last is fundamental if you don't want to spend desperate hours hunting for a puncture on an old inner tube as dusk sweeps across the moors. · Don't forget lights and reflective belts. If the weather turns, as it does in Britain, or you run out of daylight, these are essential, especially on dark country lanes. · Drinks. Even when it's cold you will need to drink because you will dehy drate. Take a water bottle, preferably one that you can attach to your bike frame. · Food. Cycling in Britain is hardly a gourmet experience and it's hard not to eat unhealthily, given the dictatorship of cream tea shops, real-ale boozers and fry-up devotees in our countryside. You might want to consider sandwiches, particularly those with a low likelihood of turning soggy during the morning. Bananas are good for energy. · Sun-block is important if you don't want your arms, legs and - who knows - bald spot, to be red raw by the end of the day. · The first 5,000 miles of the National Cycle Network opens on June 21.This is only half the story though. Sustrans, the charity coordinating its building, has another 5,000 miles due for completion by 2005 and needs more funding to continue the work. If you want to make a donation, you can become a Sustrans supporter through its website: www.sustrans.org.uk, by calling the information line on 0117 9290888 or by writing to Sustrans, 35 King Street, Bristol BS1 4DZ.

Within months Sassi di Matera, which clings to the side of a gorge gouged out by a torrent, could be uninhabited for the first time since the neolithic era. Locals, who set up emergency roadblocks for the day yesterday, have threatened to abandon the village's medieval streets and its 120 tiny cave churches unless something is done about the tourist cars and the lorries which are choking it to death. \"We are sick of living in an uninhabitable postcard,\" said Gianni Macina, vice-president of the village committee. As a last resort the residents are threatening to block the Giro d'Italia cycle race, which started from Rome on Saturday and is heading for their mountain in Basilicata, between the toe and heel of Italy. Only a cable-car and a traffic ban could save Sassi di Matera, Mr Macina says. Shopkeepers and residents echo his call. They say an increasing stream of traffic is shaking foundations, spewing dust and polluting the village. At 401m above sea level, the roar vibrates and echoes. \"We can't do it anymore,\" he said. \"At night we don't sleep. In daytime we must collect all the rubbish ourselves because the street sweepers clean only the main street.\" Residents are bitter after being encouraged by the state to keep alive the village, immortalised in Carlo Levi's novel Christ Stopped at Eboli as a symbol of southern communities' struggle to survive. Recognised by the UN as a world heritage site, Sassi di Matera is a treasury of medieval frescoes and monuments, including a 12th-century cathedral and a 15th-century castle. Its tiny houses, packed together into steep, narrow streets and small squares, were hewn from the soft rock of the valley. The village has a reputation for tenacity. It was devastated by the Franks, the Saracens, the Normans and various warlords before being subsumed into the Kingdom of Sicily, and then Italy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/15/davidhencke.robevans","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-14T23:57:14Z","webTitle":"Computer to police EU driving offences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/15/davidhencke.robevans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/15/davidhencke.robevans","fields":{"headline":"Computer to police EU driving offences","bodyText":"Drivers who commit traffic offences anywhere on holiday in Europe may find themselves taken off the road under proposals to give foreign police instant computer access to United Kingdom driving licence records. A European computer system, developed by the Dutch and at present confined to tracing stolen vehicles, is soon to be expanded to include verification of licences - enabling authorities abroad to find out previous offences committed by the motorist. The Irish Republic is going one stage further by introducing a \"penalty points\" system identical to that of the United Kingdom and allowing instant action by the Garda against motorists breaking the law. The European-wide system would mean a UK driver caught speeding, for example, by foreign police could be banned from driving in that country if a licence check showed the driver was already on the verge of a points ban. In the case of a tourist driving in the Republic, offences would lead to penalty points being imposed and those points being binding on the motorist's UK licence. The computer system, the European car and driving licence information system or Eucaris, operates in Britain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxemburg, but is being expanded under bilateral agreements across the European Union. Seven other member states are negotiating to be included and the Irish Republic is examining the conversion of its driver, vehicle and police files so it can be aligned with the system. Last night the scheme was given a cautious welcome by the AA, saying it believed a European-wide system of traffic penalties was a good idea \"in principle\" but would be hard to put into practice\". Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety, said: \"I think the principle we would be happy with, but we really want to see the nuts and bolts. \"For example, some countries don't ban you for a year for drink driving. If an Englishman is convicted over there, does that mean his disqualification becomes a year (because that is what he would get as an Englishman) or does he get a lesser ban? \"If a person from country X is prosecuted here, does it mean his penalty is diminished when he returns to his country? All those things will have to be worked out fairly first if this scheme is to work. \"We also have to watch out for anomalies where some countries rely very heavily on the statement given by the motorist at the time of the offence. While you may be OK if the offence is dealt solely by a fine system, but if you do not speak French and then have to go back to France to defend yourself, you could be in trouble.\" Details of the latest moves have been obtained by the Guardian under the Irish freedom of information act following a meeting of the countries involved in the project in Coleraine last year. The equivalent civil service policy papers would be banned by Jack Straw, the home secretary, for 30 years under Britain's draft freedom of information act now going through parliament. The documents relate to a meeting between Lord Dubs, then a junior Northern Ireland minister, and his Irish counterpart, Noel Dempsey, in Dublin in December 1998. They reveal that the two governments, alarmed about the accident rates and drivers escaping convictions on both sides of the border, wanted much more cooperation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/may/15/broadcasting.mondaymediasection2","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-15T14:47:20Z","webTitle":"Sing and the world hums","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/may/15/broadcasting.mondaymediasection2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/may/15/broadcasting.mondaymediasection2","fields":{"headline":"Sing and the world hums","bodyText":"Just under 1,000 media people were in Sweden on Saturday night, cramming the restaurants and rooms in the press centre at the giant Globen dome, where an efficient team headed by blonde Asa Wahlbom, who would not have looked out of place in Abba, organised the hundreds of sound booths, computer terminals, pigeonholes, modem sockets and interview cubicles. Even her Scandinavian calm was affected by the extraordinary demand for press passes. \"We hoped to give access to anyone who wanted to cover the event,\" she said, \"but we've had to stop issuing accreditation because all the space is occupied.\" It's like feeding an army of ants. Around 300m viewers watched The Eurovision Song Contest. I've been attending it for six years, as the BBC music executive responsible for the UK's annual entry, and the most fascinating aspect has always seemed to me to be the enormous and varied media attention it attracts. Whether at home in Birmingham, as it was in 1998 after we had won the contest with Katrina and the Waves the previous year (each year's victorious country hosts the next year's contest), or in Stockholm last weekend, the phenomenal number of journalists, TV crews, radio interviewers and commentators is staggering. I've covered American presidential conventions and worldwide charity concerts. I've been to key sporting events and vast festivals. I've coped with producing big TV programmes such as The Brits and The Record of the Year Show. But Eurovision is the one event that constantly astonishes me by the size and spread of intense interest. You cannot hope to have a quiet meal or a peaceful night out in the city without bumping into teams of foreign reporters. If you wear your badge (and there are seven different colours allowing access to all the areas of the show, from backstage to on stage), you can guarantee that during the evening several people will come up to you and introduce themselves as writers for the Croatian Gazette or the Cypriot Star. Well, look at it this way. Twenty four countries, for a start, with three or four newspapers, a couple of TV networks and half a dozen radio stations each. They all attend the event, hoping that a little local teenager will become, thanks to Eurovision, the next Madonna and give them a great regional interest story at the same time. And let's be honest, kids having their hearts broken because of the lack of taste of the global televoters provides an equally lively headline. Twenty three out of the 24 entrants are losers, after all. Then throw in the global fascination. America has dozens of representatives - California alone sent several TV crews this year. Fred Bronson, Billboard's veteran reporter, regards it as the music event of the year and flies in from Hollywood every May to cover it. Australians are always there. Likewise, the obligatory Japanese (is there anything they don't cover?). This year, I met a journalist from Taiwan, a TV crew from China and two radio hosts from a small station in Vietnam. I've obtained the official list of the 987 media members. This includes Duane Zigliotto from Sydney, New South Wales (I'd have guessed Naples), Emir Hacimic from Bosnia Hercegovina, Jegors Jerohomovics from Latvia (made-up name?), Alexei Smirnov from Russia (ditto), and Angel Galleco-Vega from the United Kingdom (who are you fooling, Angel, why not just admit Puerto Rico?). The last two names on the list, for some reason, are Bruce, Ken and Wogan, Terry. Never heard of them. And Eurovision never lets its audience down. Even those ghastly rightwing religious fascists in Jerusalem last year could grin with delight when transsexual Dana International tripped on her high heels and sprawled all over the stage in front of hundreds of millions. God got his own back, they decided. But Dana didn't mind. She takes herself considerably less seriously than her opponents do. So why is it that the ancient, non-credible, localised phenomenon of Eurovision has become the global magnet for virtually every media representative? I think it's because it's so good- hearted. There really is a terrific feeling of bonhomie. Nobody can take pop music that seriously. By definition it's fun, superficial, transitory and frothy. Nobody's dying. There are no wars or famines. It doesn't elect leaders or praise greatness. It's an evening of laughter and joy and frivolity. Which, after all, incorporates the essence of humanity. Eurovision attracts the media people for exactly the same reasons that viewers love it. We all love a trip to somewhere different, a few days not having to concentrate on heavy issues, an excuse to giggle and gossip and laugh. I reckon that if you polled the greatest news gatherers in the world on their favourite event of the year, Eurovision would come out on top. And quite right too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2000/may/17/hospitals.futureofthenhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-17T01:14:19Z","webTitle":"Hospitals look to China to ease nurses crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/may/17/hospitals.futureofthenhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/may/17/hospitals.futureofthenhs","fields":{"headline":"Hospitals look to China to ease nurses crisis","bodyText":"The NHS is turning to China in a desperate attempt to recruit nurses for Britain's short-staffed hospitals. In the first initiative of its kind, the head of the NHS recruitment division will this month lead a delegation of hospital trusts to China to discuss the official secondment of nurses on short term contracts. About 100 Chinese nurses have already arrived in Britain and are undergoing adaptation training and assessment before being considered for professional registration. The NHS is short of about 17,000 nurses, even though the government has created 4,000 extra training places and helped generate a 73% increase in applications for nursing diploma courses. Individual trusts have increasingly resorted to overseas recruitment, mainly from Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. But this the first government backed drive to bring nurses from abroad. Last November the government banned poaching from developing countries - particularly South Africa and the Caribbean - unless their governments gave consent. The Department of Health said yesterday that the China venture was strictly at the invitation of its government, which wanted its nurses to gain experience elsewhere. \"The NHS team will be finding out more about nursing and health provision in China in order to decide whether to accept the Chinese authorities' request for cooperation in enhancing the education and skills of Chinese nurses,\" a department statement said. \"The purpose of the initial visit is to gather information to enable the trusts to decide whether they wish to participate in this initiative and offer a period of employment to some nurses. \"The Chinese authorities have been very keen to encourage the NHS to employ Chinese nurses, but has made it clear that it would be essential for any staff employed to return to China at the end of the contract.\" Five trusts will be represented on the delegation, to be led by David Amos, head of the NHS Executive recruitment and retention unit. Among the five are believed to be St Mary's hospital in Paddington, west London, and Brighton Health Care. A health department spokeswoman said the trip was being paid for by the NHS \"on a minimum basis\" and would last a matter of days. The United Kingdom Cen tral Council, nursing's regulatory body, meanwhile disclosed that some 100 Chinese nurses had already arrived in Britain. About half had come direct and the others had moved on from jobs in other countries - mainly Saudi Arabia, the US and Canada. A council spokesman said the nurses were typically working as health care assistants while undergoing a period of adaptation, being tested especially on their mastery of English. \"Our understanding is that they have been trained to standards we would recognise. The big factor is language: not just being able to find your way around in a tourist kind of way, but more about being able to communicate with patients.\" A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing said: \"We welcome the experience and skills of nurses around the world, but overseas recruitment should not be seen as a long term solution to nurse shortages. \"The RCN is supportive of recruitment under the new ethical guidelines, which take account of the workforce needs of the origin country. To address nurse shortages, we need to continue to raise the value of nursing as a career to attract UK recruits and to retain experienced nurses.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/may/17/8","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-17T01:14:21Z","webTitle":"City briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/may/17/8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/may/17/8","fields":{"headline":"City briefing","bodyText":"Whitbread sells Swallow estate British brewing and leisure group Whitbread is to sell its Swallow Inns and restaurants to Enterprise Inns for £119m.

An analysis of the Pentagon's test-flight data claims to show that the US's planned anti-missile interceptor system is incapable of distinguishing between a missile and a decoy, a former defence department adviser said. Assertions that the US would be able to protect its citizens against incoming enemy missiles by taking them out with interceptors cannot be sustained on the basis of the data from the current US test programme, Professor Theodore Postol of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says. If Mr Postol is correct, President Clinton's decision later this summer about whether to go ahead with the $60bn (£40bn) NMD project will be taken on unreliable scientific evidence, and the anti-missile system which the US would install might not work. The potentially devastating charges against NMD come as Nato foreign ministers prepare to debate the US plan at a summit in Italy next week. Currently, no Nato member state other than the US favours the system. Mr Postol, who was scientific adviser to the Pentagon's chief of naval operations under President Ronald Reagan from 1982 to 1984, says that the data from the first of four NMD system tests prove that the anti-missile interceptor \"will be defeated by the simplest of balloon decoys\". In that test, which took place in June 1997 and involved a \"fly-by\" by an interceptor, the interceptor was unable to differentiate between warheads and balloon decoys. The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (BMDO) and its contractors subsequently \"attempted to hide this fact\" by tampering with the data and by changing subsequent tests to obscure \"programme-stopping facts\", Mr Postol charged in a letter sent to the White House on May 11. Later tests, including the scheduled June 26 test on the basis of which Mr Clinton is due to make his deployment decision, have consisted only of a warhead and a single, intensely illuminated balloon decoy. This has enabled the interceptor to make a simple differentiation between the two objects and has allowed the Pentagon to claim that its test programme has been more successful than it really has been, Mr Postol says. \"It is an elaborate hoax. It appears to be a piece of science when in fact it is just mumbo-jumbo,\" Mr Postol said yesterday \"It is a pretty coordinated fraud between the BMDO and its contractors. The system is not in any way workable. If an adversary deployed a bunch of aluminium balloons, the interceptor would not be able to tell which was the missile.\" The letter called for additional analysis of the NMD system by independent scientists. A White House spokesman said that it was premature to create an outside review of the NMD test programme. A spokesman for the BMDO said that a detailed written response to Mr Postol's charges was being prepared. President Clinton has said that the decision to deploy NMD - which is bitterly opposed by almost every government in the world, including Russia, China and, less vocally, the United Kingdom - will depend upon four factors: whether it works, what it will cost, whether it is judged necessary, and its impact upon international arms control. While it would be difficult for Mr Clinton to deploy the NMD system if it was shown not to work, the political imperatives of a US election year may compel him to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/may/19/news","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-19T10:33:56Z","webTitle":"May 19: In brief and latest casting news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/19/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/may/19/news","fields":{"headline":"May 19: In brief and latest casting news","bodyText":"• Building on the success of the revolutionary Kingdom Come website (see our review), director Michael Winterbottom has teamed up with Revolution Films to form a film and TV website design company - Resolve Media.

Who warned that cows with BSE could pose a threat to humans, when the government was categorically denying there was any risk? In both cases, the early warnings came from the media. A probing, questioning press is the citizen's prime safeguard against an officialdom whose natural reaction is to try to hush things up. Britain's culture of secrecy is buttressed by harsh libel laws and weak rights of access to official information. The freedom of information bill, now going through parliament, gives fewer rights to official information than those enjoyed by citizens of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Irish Republic. In some respects, the rights are weaker than those under the last Tory government's open government code. But three other bills well on their way to enactment with much less media attention also threaten the public's right to know or the ability of journalists to perform their watchdog role: the local government bill, the terrorism bill, and the regulation of investigatory powers bill. The freedom of information bill has drawn criticism from MPs and peers of all parties, yet ministers have made minimal concessions and the bill is progressing through parliament in essence unchanged. There are blanket exemptions for whole categories of information. Not only are sensitive policy discussions excluded - a standard exemption under FOI legislation worldwide - but also the factual information on which policy decisions are based, which other governments make available to their citizens. Scientific advice, on BSE for example, opinion polls, and submissions by lobbyists would all be exempt. Where information was exempt, the new information commissioner would be able to order disclosure in the public interest, but a minister would be able to veto the order. Under a late concession, the veto would have to be exercised by a cabinet minister. But under Ireland's 1997 Freedom of Information Act, the information commissioner can compel disclosure on public interest grounds and cannot be overruled by ministers. The FOI bill covers local authorities, NHS trusts, quangos and a wide range of public bodies as well as government departments. Information gathered through investigations is exempt, even if the investigation is over and prosecutions finished. That rules out much information about safety hazards, including the Paddington rail crash, deaths on building sites, and data falsification by BNFL- the type of information which has proved a powerful tool in the US for holding careless companies to account. Police investigations are exempt too, despite the Macpherson report's recommendation that the police should be fully accountable under freedom of information laws. Another clause exempts \"commercially confidential\" information - the excuse already used by the government to deny the Consumers' Association information on pension and endowment misselling. A catch-all clause, which applies to public bodies as well as government departments, allows disclosure to be refused if \"in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person\" - a minister or official - it would \"prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs\". The local government bill will take away existing rights to information about local authority decision-making. Now, most important council decisions are taken at open meet ings of the council or its committees, with council papers available beforehand. Under the bill, most decisions will be taken by the mayor or leader, individual councillors with executive powers, or a cabinet of councillors. Cabinets will be able to sit in secret and only have to publish their decisions once taken. Councils will be able to take decisions about housing, social services, and education in much greater secrecy. People will lose their existing rights to know, which apply only where meetings are open. They will have no right to know what decisions are about to be taken or to see reports and official papers in advance. The terrorism bill puts journalists in danger of arrest, search and questioning, and having material seized if they cover the activities not only of organisations most people would regard as terrorist, but also campaigning bodies, protesters and even workers involved in industrial disputes. The bill widens the definition of terrorism from political causes to include religious or ideological causes, and the definition of violence to include violent action against property as well as people. Poll tax demonstrators, road protesters or groups taking action against GM crops would come within the ambit of the bill. It would become a crime not to report suspicions about certain terrorist activities, but the definition of terrorism is so wide that journalists could find themselves expected to inform on a large range of campaigning organisations or activities. Photographers and cameramen in Northern Ireland who cover assemblies and funerals could be forced to hand over film. The bill makes it a criminal offence to collect information likely to be useful to a terrorist - which could include politicians' home addresses. The regulation of investigatory powers bill will jeopardise journalists' sources and confidential information. The bill will allow the state to intercept email and telephone communications across private networks, and force the decoding of scrambled information, for the purposes of detecting crime, preventing disorder, for public safety, protecting public health, and even \"in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom\". Law enforcement agencies would be able to force individuals to hand over encryption keys and passwords needed to decode encrypted data, and those individuals would be barred from telling anyone else, including an employer, about the demand. Those who lose or forget their password would risk a jail sentence of up to two years unless they could prove that it was forgotten or lost. The four bills add up to a legislative programme which, says the Society of Editors, \"will erode current safeguards, extend state powers, outlaw legitimate journalistic investigation and bolster state secrecy\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/may/22/tonyblair.healthandwellbeing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-22T10:21:47Z","webTitle":"Basking in the son","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/22/tonyblair.healthandwellbeing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/may/22/tonyblair.healthandwellbeing","fields":{"headline":"Basking in the son","bodyText":"When politicians want to ingratiate themselves with the electorate they are pictured kissing a baby; not a small child or a little old lady, but an infant. The association with a tiny, weeny, cooing, gurgling little babbakinsy-poos has a special power. Tony Blair has pulled off a spectacular variation of this political stunt. Not only can he now show off his baby son, he can do so in the run- up to an election. This is particularly desirable for a prime minister who, despite his popularity, has never really been loved or lovable. But what is most interesting of all is that no one - not even the most hardened of cynical political pundits - seems to doubt that the arrival of Blair Minimus will be a huge electoral asset, adding poll percentage points. No other life event would have the same effect on a politician's standing; not getting married, not being cured of a terrible illness, not even being in charge of the nation when winning the World Cup. The appeal of the little blighters seems to have exploded just lately, extending beyond the traditional domain of women into the lap or on to the shoulder of men, not all of them New. Take Dennis Wise, a man not known for his maternal, caring sharing ways. When he went up to collect the FA Cup on Saturday he stopped off to pick up his tiny infant. Astonishingly, we Chelsea supporters witnessed the implicit message that winning the cup was less important than showering his babba with kisses. To a significant extent this act was almost certainly copycat babyism. For it had been only a few days earlier that David Beckham celebrated winning the league title in the company of his 14 month old son Brooklyn. The other Manchester United players also brought their offspring onto the pitch. Nor is this a bit of local madness infecting soccer players. Across the media, celebrities known for their stereotypically masculine ways are showing signs of baby love. The Gallagher brothers, supposedly wild men of rock, did not turn up for the launch party of their new album because they were babysitting. Said a besotted Liam of his new son Lennon, \"I realise I'm blessed.\" Damon Albarn, his great rival, is talking of giving up work to look after his baby. Martin Clunes, who played the misogynistic Gary in the BBC's Men Behaving Badly recently added his voice to the chorus of baby-worhippers. \"No matter how many preconceptions you have nothing really prepares you for the second when your baby is born.\" What is going on? What accounts for the baby's pulling power? More than 50 years ago the ethologist Konrad Lorenz suggested that infants are equipped with features that automatically set off a rush of emotions in us. Their cuteness is comprised of soft skin and hair, almost adult-sized eyes from birth, big pupils, chubby cheeks, fully formed hands and feet, and small noses. Their heads are big and their limbs are small and springy. Evolutionists claim our response to these traits is built into us because infants need to arrive irresistible because without care they die. The basic baby construction is said to have profound meaning to us and to elicit tender feeling for this reason. As with all evolutionary psychological theories, it is a speculation which cannot be proved or disproved. Certainly, it is true that juvenile traits in animals instinctively evoke nurture. Chicks have stripes, lion cubs have spots and tail rings, and baby chimps have white tail tufts, all of which signal their helplessness. Thus, chimps who lose the tail tuft are not safe from attack. In the same way, it is speculated, the big heads, big eyes, chubby cheeks and little noses of human infants trigger a protective instinct in us. There is evidence that babies who do not look very babyish because they are ill or deformed or ugly receive less attention than normal-looking ones. The inference is that mothers are genetically primed to seek signs of health and not to waste valuable energy on infants who are a bad biological bet. It has also been suggested that men are responding to neotonous, infantile features when they are attracted to women. Evolutionists believe that men are attracted to the looks of the helpless and dependent. If infant features automatically evoke nurture then the more infantile a woman looks, the more men she will attract. Certainly, it is true that male desire is triggered by youthful attributes. A survey of 454 traditional societies showed that the average age of brides was between 12 and 15 years. The extreme youthfulness of the look (and increasingly, the age) of models in developed nations suggests this age group retain their desirability. In developed nations, when people are asked to create separate generic images for a child, an adult, a man and a woman using a special computer programme, they create very similar ones for female and child and for male and adult. As faces age they become more masculine; to look feminine is to look young. On top of all this, I would hazard that the appeal of a baby is also its psychological attributes, especially its authenticity. As soon as offspring can talk there is a loss of innocence. They show signs of the cunning, self-interest and other ugly adult attributes that led to Sartre's dictum \"hell is other people.\" By contrast, an infant is incapable of pretence. Honest emotion, unmediated by thought and language, can be witnessed on its face. In exactly the same way that a pet is unpretending and can be trusted, a baby denotes uncomplicated truthfulness. Certainly, when a politician plants his kiss on the baby (women politicians do not seem to do the baby gag) he is emphasising his nurturant potential - \"I'm a guy who can care for and show love towards the vulnerable.\". But every bit as much, he is also saying, \"You can trust me like you can trust a baby. I'm a human being (as well as a lying shit).\" But having said all this, there are also strong grounds for doubting that our intense feelings about babies are nearly as much powered by instinct as evolutionists would maintain. The fact is that much as we may love babies, we also hate them and, in evolutionary terms, until very recently there was a strong case for parents not to get too attached to offspring until they have passed the age of five. The problem with babies in the past was that they were a dangerous drain on emotional and physical resources. At least one quarter of children died before the age of five. Women gave birth to an average of eight children so the high infant mortality rate would have rocked them twice during their childbearing years unless they avoided caring too passionately for their infants. As the psychohistorian Lloyd De Mause put it, \"The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awake. The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorised and sexually abused.\" In this view, our passionate love for infants is a relatively new development. I found plenty of support for De Mause's analysis when carrying out a study of childcare in a village in western Ecuador. It was typical in most respects of what life was like for the majority of the world's population before 1900, with high infant mortality and basic subsistence a constant struggle. Few of the mothers became intensely attached to their infants. Given the infant mortality rate this made sense. If they fell in love with their babies in the way that mothers in technologically developed societies are supposed to do, they would be putting themselves at grave risk of suffering repeated bereavement. Other cross-cultural research bears this out. Compared with mothers in urban developed nations, those from agrarian, undeveloped nations are more concerned with meeting the physical needs and protecting the health of the infant than with forming intense relationships through play and talk. It has even been argued that abuse was a natural, healthy adaptation. Jay Belsky, a key thinker in this debate based at King's College in London, writes that \"across the animal kingdom, the mistreatment of progeny is so widespread that it would seem to be as much a part of the 'natural' condition as is sensitive, solicitious parental behaviour.\" He points out that in humans as well as animals, the interests of offspring and parents frequently compete rather than coincide. When this competition becomes too threatening to the parent's mental health or physical survival, abuse is liable to happen. Belsky presents extensive evidence that where instability, unpredictability or unavailability of resources exist for parents, they are more likely to maltreat children. Thus, poverty and low income correlate strongly with abuse and neglect. In evolutionary terms there were two conflicting pressures at work when it comes to babies. From their standpoint it made great sense to evolve as innately attractive, otherwise they would not survive. But for parents they were a risky investment before the age of five, a large drain on resources it was best not to get too attached to. In fact, genes may play only a minimal part in our feelings about babies, perhaps giving us a general tendency to feel positively towards them but allowing great variation depending on circumstances. Many individuals, for all sorts of reasons, prefer toddlers or children to helpless infants. Mothers who work full-time are more likely to believe that genes largely determine the personality of a child and that parental care is relatively unimportant. Full-time mothers are more likely to believe that what they do forms the child. It may well also be that the working mothers prefer children who can talk and with whom they can have a more adult relationship than infants. Indeed, many parents find the massive dependence of infants alarming and actually depressing. Women who are vulnerable to the illness are are at greatest risk of developing it during the first six months of a child's life. That parents of both sexes can find infants immensely upsetting is the reason why babies under the age of one are four times more likely than other age groups to be murdered. Nor is violence an unusual response - threequarters of infants have been hit by a parent before their first birthday. It is easily forgotten that until very recently anyone who could afford to would pass the care of their infant over to a nanny and that the example the aristocracy set was of a nonchalant lack of passion. Not until his fourth birthday did Charles share the day with Prince Philip (he was absent for six of the first eight birthdays). His mother seems to have been able to contain her enthusiasm for the future king as well. Her biographer reports that on returning to Britain after a six-week absence, the separation from her infant son had not caused \"any obvious consternation\" to her and therefore she did not \"find it neccessary to rush back to him.\" She caught up on her correspondence and other administration at home, went with her mother to watch one of her horses race and only after four days did she finally visit her two year old son. It is hard to imagine a mother acting like that today and even harder still to find such a negligent father. We can be sure that whatever the reality, Blair will not be presented as having acted like this. Indeed, one of the strongest pieces of evidence that baby love is largely dictated by social trends is today's unprecedented passion of men for their babies. A study done in 1960 found that the pupils of women and children dilate when shown a picture of a baby but not the pupils of a man. In those days men had no involvement in baby care and most had no special feeling towards them. But if that research were repeated today and the subjects included the likes of David Beckham or Liam Gallagher, the results would be very different. Part of the explanation for the new male passion is their increasing presence at the birth, following childbirth classes. Subsequently, they are more expected to change nappies and pull their weight and this greater involvement has increased their awareness of the the charms of the infant. There are even studies which are now being published that show men experience \"sympathetic pregnancies\" with their partners, up to and including changes in their hormonal balance. None of this change is remotely to do with genes. As with all the bogus attempts to explain our psychology by evolution, it turns out that your particular family history and the society you are in are far stronger determinants of your psychology.

Nothing more demanding to do than to stand in a packed sports hall and count the number of breeze blocks in the walls. Oh the pleasure of knowing that there are nine rivets to every roof truss, or that you can make up dozens of words out of the phrase \"Centre Number\". Yes, it's invigilation time once again. There are several ways to pass the time. Of course, walking the length of an aisle slowly in squeaky shoes is mildly diverting. Responding to a raised arm with brio is satisfying. Often the anxious questioner poses a painfully helpless comment like: \"Do I have to answer all the questions?\" \"Well, have you read the instructions?\" \"Yes, but it's all different from the mock exam.\" \"Well it would be, wouldn't it.\" But it turns out that the student was expecting a maths paper and the one they are staring at is economics. The fact that the paper started half an hour ago is another matter. People do funny things under examination pressure. Or rather, they do the wrong thing. And then there is the bladder moment, when the urge to rush to the toilet sets in. Once you have dealt with one student another one wants to go. This is not a problem. If you are lucky you can kill a good 20 minutes with trips to the loo. Even if this means skulking outside the toilets pretending to find the fire notice interesting. It is much the same domino effect with rulers, rubbers and any other piece of equipment that a question demands and the student has failed to bring. Trying to remember who has borrowed what from whom and where keeps the mind active. Helping yourself to a student's last Rolo is a fair reward for this service. In calm moments when your eyelids grow heavy, surveying the number of mascots on desks can pass an amusing few moments. Last year miniature teddy bears were popular, along with other fluffy members of the animal kingdom. However, when Roxanne, one of my own students, seated herself and then tipped something out of a jam jar I felt obliged to comment. \"You can't bring that in here,\" I whispered. \"But it is dead.\" She poked the rabbit's foot. \"And the rest of the rabbit?\" While Roxanne stared at me I understood what it feels like to be withered by a look. I retreated to my temporary torpor only to spot my mate Colin from maths lurking by the door. Colin has a reputation for organising boredom-relieving games in an exam hall. People who know this look to see when he is invigilating and then do a swap just to be on duty with him. One of Colin's favourites is to stand at the back where he can't be seen by the candidates and do a mime. He is fond of performing film titles. No student has ever asked why \"Deep Throat\" or \"Basic Instinct\" was added to the list of exams written on the whiteboard. But it doesn't need Colin to organise a round of \"Hunt the Phone\". It is the regulation that everyone has to leave their bags at the front of the exam hall. This is fine, until a mobile phone goes off. And, of course, it's always the last one you tear open that contains the offending item. Last time that bag turned out to be a tatty looking briefcase with a combination lock.

Responding to criticism in the Commons, Jack Straw said he had looked at a number of issues before coming to his decision on the boxer's visa request. \"It is my responsibility to make these decisions on the law as it exists,\" he said. \"The simple fact of the matter is that this particular immigration rule had been observed mainly in the breach rather than in the observance. \"Above all I had to take account of whether in this particular case Mr Tyson's entry would pose a risk to the public and on the basis of the history of this application and the need for fairness and consistency I took the decision that I did.\" Mr Straw said he had laid before the house a consultative document proposing changes in the immigration rules and their more consistent application in the future. Earlier Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill) used parliamentary privilege during question time to make accusations that one of the promoters of the bout has a violent criminal past. Without naming the promoter Mrs Fyfe asked whether Mr Straw had considered the policing requirements needed for the fight. She added: \"Are you aware that one of the promoters of this fight has a violent criminal past and has connections with Glasgow's criminal underworld?\" Senior Labour backbencher David Winnick urged Mr Straw to reconsider his decision. \"What sort of message is it if a convicted rapist like Tyson is allowed into the United Kingdom?\" he asked. \"Are you aware that it is men as well as women who are deeply opposed to allowing him in? I hope you will understand the feelings on this side at least and reconsider your decision.\" Meanwhile, at a press conference in Glasgow, promoter Frank Warren said the bout against Lou Savarese at Hampden Park would probably be the biggest fight to be held in the UK in financial and audience terms. He said it would be staged at 11pm before a sell-out audience of around 58,000 people, and would be televised to millions more in 180 countries worldwide. Nearly 20,000 applications had come in even before the box office number had been announced, he said. Mr Warren was accompanied at the press conference by Jimmy Wray, MP for Glasgow Baillieston, who has described Scots parliamentarians as \"a bunch of cackling geese\" for criticising Mr Straw's decision. Mr Wray said he was delighted the fight was coming to Scotland. \"Does Hampden not need the money? Does Glasgow not need the money?\" he said. Mr Wray also described the offence for which Tyson was convicted as \"a misdemeanour\" but, when questioned about that description, withdrew it and said: \"It is a serious offence. If I used the word misdemeanour I did not mean to belittle it.\" Women's groups will meet in Glasgow today to discuss whether to seek a judicial review of Mr Straw's decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/24/britishidentity.jamesmeikle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-24T01:37:35Z","webTitle":"England branded to pull in tourists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/24/britishidentity.jamesmeikle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/24/britishidentity.jamesmeikle","fields":{"headline":"England branded to pull in tourists","bodyText":"Never mind the violence of English soccer hooligans, the most enduring images of England are its heritage, tranquillity, culture, innovation, vibrancy, youth culture and city life according to tourist chiefs who today refuel the debate over national identity by trying to \"brand\" the country. Their new logo represents such \"English values\" with a rampant lion, a country road winding towards a distant village and its church spire, the masks of comedy and tragedy and an \"energy rose\", linked by the traditional cross of St George. Research among home consumers and foreign visitors by the English tourism council is said to have revealed \"a personality\" of England, \"hidebound by tradition on the one hand, yet progressive on the other; conventional yet unconventional, controlled but spontaneous; majestic and also humble ... conformist in our approach, being part of the crowd but at other times being non-conformist; straight and even formal, but also with a well developed sense of irony\". There is little irony evident in the £150,000 packaging of the new Englishness which also advises holiday operators about brand speak. They are encouraged to entice visitors with promises such as: \"From dreaming spires to millennium domes - there's nowhere quite like England.\" This tone of voice is \"humorous, confident and engaging\", whereas a \"downbeat and dull\" description of \"England - where tradition never dies\" is said to imply \"that's the only thing there is\". Likewise, \"England - there is always something different around the corner\" is \"intriguing, quirky and confident\" while \"England - always new and exciting\" is \"one-dimensional and rather flat\". The council insisted yesterday that the money had been well spent and was far less than the £1m or more often invested in brand strategy by multinational companies. \"Branding doesn't apply simply to consumer products and services. Countries can also benefit from developing positive brand images.\" About 85% of the 26m people likely to visit Britain this year will simply see England, and half of all foreign visitors see London, but competition from dragon-branded Wales, and Scotland, represented by its thistle, is growing. The tourism council also wants to persuade more English people to stay at home for their holidays and not be lured away by sun, sea and sand images of Spain, or the attractions of neighbouring France. The new brand follows years of debate not only about whether the English need or want devolved political institutions like other parts of the United Kingdom to help preserve their identity but also about the nature of modern Britishness. While John Major famously appealed to traditional images of England, warm beer and cricket on the village green, Tony Blair seems happier with promoting Britain as a hothouse of industrial and artistic innovation. As an alternative to the new \"flag\" branding, tour operators can use a smaller \"signature\" mark which simply has the energy rose hovering over the curves of the gentler English countryside. Mary Lynch, chief executive of the tourism council, said England was a \"fantastic country, full of contrasts, and it is these contrasts which define England's uniqueness - beautiful countryside and vibrant cities, avant garde culture and old landscapes, seaside towns and rural villages ... our individuality is central to the brand.\" Colin Doyle, secretary of the Countrywide Holidays Association, said: \"In a vast moving world, with consumer choice at previously unimagined levels, brands are vital to capture customers.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2000/may/24/highereducation.news","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-24T01:37:37Z","webTitle":"Hey, big spenders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/may/24/highereducation.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/may/24/highereducation.news","fields":{"headline":"Hey, big spenders","bodyText":"Ministers have been California dreamin'. Trying to find a key to a prosperous future for the United Kingdom, they have often been impressed by the entrepreneurial buzz surrounding the cluster of hi- tech businesses around the south San Francisco bay, silicon valley. Former trade and industry secretary Peter Mandelson came back convinced that we too could develop the next Microsoft, or Hewlett Packard - if only we could translate the fruit of university research into the next wave of new technology start-up firms. Inspired after his own American tour, Gordon Brown announced a £64m grant for Cambridge to help it pick up entrepreneurial tips from the US, especially the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). But a study out today says there is little chance the UK can become the California of Europe. For a start Californian businesses spend four times as much as the entire UK on research and development. If the UK were an American state, it would roughly be on par with Virginia or Oregon, not known as hotbeds of innovative activity. Commissioned by vice-chancellors for the Whitehall spending review, the report puts paid to the UK's pretensions to be on its way to becoming one of the leading technologically advanced nations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures show the investment gap in research is widening. The Blair government's preoccupation with encouraging academics to be more commercial is misguided. It is in company board rooms that more needs to be done to open minds to new ideas and developments. Aggregate research and development spending in the UK - by government and businesses together - has remained stagnant since the mid-80s. We have the slowest rate of growth in the OECD in R&amp;D spending and the gap between the UK and top OECD performers is increasing every year. In terms of the research budgets of government departments, the UK spends less than half as much as the OECD leaders. This gap is also escalating. And the industrial capacity to exploit research in the UK is weak in comparison to other OECD countries. The table sums up the position on company spending: the UK spends half as much as Sweden and the US per capita on business R&amp;D and the gap is widening. \"The 90s were a lost decade for UK private investment in R&amp;D,\" concludes the report (Talent, not Technology: Publicly Funded Research and Innovation in the UK, available on www.sussex.ac. uk/spru/index.html). While France and Germany invested inadequately over the same period, each also showed a poor overall economic performance. Other factors help explain their poor performance, such as the integration of the east into Germany and meeting entry conditions for the euro. In the UK, however, 1992-1997 were years of expansion. As for the universities, their research spending per head of population is less than half the amount spent in academic institutions in the United States. The UK has the 16th lowest growth rate in higher education R&amp;D in the OECD. Despite all that, researchers in this country perform well enough. Whatever measurement system is used, the UK is still among the world leaders across different scientific subjects. For example among the OECD countries, UK researchers produced the highest number of publications per millions of pounds of research funding in higher education in 1997. Of 152 recognised fields of research, the UK is a world leader in 26 of them. The number of citations (in scientific journals) per unit of funding is also high in the UK relative to other countries. This may however reflect past investment in university laboratories and infrastructure and the next generation of UK researchers may not be able to sustain this record. What returns does the UK get from this research? We do not know, at least the evidence is patchy, despite the best efforts of the authors of this report, from the science and and technology policy research group at the University of Sussex. Studies find a rate of return falling in the range between 20% and 50% of initial investment. Research does however have identifiable qualitative benefits: increasing the stock of useful knowledge; supplying skilled graduates; enhancing technological problem- solving capacity; creating new instrumentation; generating new firms; and providing new social knowledge. Schemes introduced by the present government have encouraged the exploitation of knowledge produced by the universities - which was highlighted in the 1998 recent competitiveness white paper. But there are limits to the commercial role that uni versities can play. Universities could be more entrepreneurial and in general universities tend to be poor commercial agents. The report suggests that an exaggerated emphasis on promoting university commercialisation is misplaced because it treats universities as a source of technology rather than scientific talent. \"The government needs to be conscious of the limits to commercial exploitation of university research, and should attempt to emulate the best of US practice. Where US universities have been most successful in supporting economic development, they have been allowed the academic freedom to develop and publish new ideas freely and to recruit and retain talented people.\" Lee Elliot-Major is higher education editor for Guardian Unlimited lee.elliot-major@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/24/alantravis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-24T01:38:00Z","webTitle":"Home Office reduces family visit bond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/24/alantravis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/24/alantravis","fields":{"headline":"Home Office reduces family visit bond","bodyText":"The scale of Jack Straw's climbdown over the plan to impose immigration \"bonds\" on visa applicants who want to visit relatives in Britain became clear last night when the Home Office said it was pressing ahead with a trial scheme for visitors from the Philippines and Morocco only. The bonds were to have been introduced for the hundreds of thousands of people from the Indian sub-continent who visit Britain each year for weddings, funerals and other events on family visit visas. The idea was put forward by Indian organisations as an alternative for those refused visas because entry clearance officers suspected they would not leave Britain at the end of their family visit. It was proposed that the family members in Britain would put up a cash payment in advance of the visit which would be returned when the visitor left the country. Initial reports that the bond was to be fixed at £10,000 stirred fierce opposition to the scheme. Last night the immigration minister, Barbara Roche, said in a Commons written answer that the bond would be set at £3,000. \"The pilot study on financial bonds will begin in October at two posts overseas, Manila and Casablanca,\" she said. \"It will run for six months, followed by a further six months to monitor departure from the United Kingdom, and a further, brief period for analysis of the results.\" It would be used in borderline cases: as an alternative to refusing a family visit visa if the applicant's intention to leave the UK was in doubt. The latest figures show that in 1998 1,500 people were refused a family visit visa at the embassy in Manila and 350 in Casablanca. A financial bond is expected to be used in only a small proportion of such cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/26/politicalnews.guardiancolumnists","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-26T01:26:50Z","webTitle":"Ploughing through agriculture questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/26/politicalnews.guardiancolumnists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/may/26/politicalnews.guardiancolumnists","fields":{"headline":"Ploughing through agriculture questions","bodyText":"Summer in the Commons, and agriculture questions provide a riot of colour. Sitting on benches as green as rolling hills, Shona McIsaac and Joan Ruddock are both wearing yellow jackets, the colour of genetically modified oilseed rape. Joyce Quin, a junior minister, is in dark green, like a field of early barley, and Ruth Kelly sports a suit the colour of bluebells in a sunlit copse. Only Anne McIntosh, Tory MP for the Vale of York, trim and elegant in her brown jacket, reminds us of the sombre hues of winter. But Ms McIntosh has no need for artificial cheer. She leads a life crammed with exciting incident, all of which she faxes to our Guardian office here at Westminster. \"MP queries council bid for new tennis centre,\" we learn. \"MP says, let's talk more pork!\" and \"Just the ticket! MP debates bus services in Vale of York.\" One recent arrival records: \"MP puts Vale of York on the map\", which is kind of her, though not strictly necessary. It's a vale, near York. Other Tories attacked the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, who they detest because he seems so nerdy. On pigmeat prices, Edward Leigh said that the French would never put up with the situation. \"We want a minister who is less nice, and acts more like a Frenchman!\" (He didn't say which Frenchman, but Marcel Marceau would be my choice. His speeches were so short.) \"Bonjour, Madam Speaker,\" said Mr Brown, to howls of laughter. This is an example of parliamentary humour, being completely unamusing out of context, but at the time, frightfully dreary. Mr Brown had a reply, one of those superb pieces of jargon which modern farming tends to throw up. \"Supply exceeds demand,\" he said, then added: \"the classic pig cycle has plummeted.\" It sounded like the storyboard from a Warner Bros cartoon. On we ploughed. Mr Doug Naysmith wanted to know when the full passports for pets scheme would be \"rolled out\". You'll know when you start to see people holding up their dobermans in the photo booths, trying to get their eyes level with the flash. John Bercow, the doberman of the Tory benches, essayed a sneer at Peter Mandelson, not something I would ever do. Will any ministers be taking advantage of the scheme, he asked. \"Will the Northern Ireland secretary's dog Bobby be an early beneficiary?\" There were many implications in this question, including the suggestion that the law might have been changed for one minister, and the faintly camp whiff which clings to single men who love their little dogs. But Mr Bercow was shot down, port engine ablaze, by Ms Quin. \"You seem to have forgotten that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.\" It would be an exaggeration to say that Mr Bercow looked embarrassed. He wouldn't look embarrassed if he arrived in the chamber with his hair replaced by oilseed rape. But he did look rather silly. The jargon continued. Mr James Paice, a Tory spokesman, demanded the government \"amalgamate set-aside in terms of headlands, so farmers can be persuaded to convert headlands to go to conservation set-aside,\" a remark which appeared to make perfect sense to everyone except me. Only Derek Wyatt could grow lyrical about this subject. \"Lapwings, skylarks, bunting and curlew numbers are growing. How can we cope if nature prefers set-aside?\" My eyes strayed to Ms Judy Mallaber, MP for Amber Valley. Her hair, a mass of red curls, made her look like a majestic copper beech.

A Ghanaian general, Emmanuel Erskine, sat on his shooting stick, high above the Litani river, waiting for the signal for his UN forces to occupy the vacated Israeli positions. He waited in vain, until an Israeli officer approached to tell him that most of the positions had instead been handed over to Lebanese Christian militiamen allied to Israel. Erskine, a formidable combination of British military style and African male presence, looked the Israeli up and down and pronounced: \"Major, you are a fuck-up.\" It is a phrase that could be applied to almost everything Israel has attempted in Lebanon since, including this week's final retreat. Operation Litani, the name the Israelis gave their 1978 incursion, was to be followed in June 1982 by a full-scale invasion that took their troops to Beirut and led to the Sabra and Shatilla massacres, and the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon. After that came countless other ground actions, bombings, and shellings as spring followed spring in southern Lebanon. Somehow, in spite of it all, the wheat continued to be sown and harvested, an example of human obduracy from which the Israelis should have learned a lesson. The Israeli record in Lebanon illustrated again and again that military power is often an illusory currency which a state can spend and spend without permanent gain or result. Israel in its early years was a country bent only on survival. The fortunes of war then brought it control over the West Bank, Gaza, and the Sinai, and from this position of widened power, Israel launched an ambitious attempt to remake the Middle East in a way more suited to her interests. The Lebanese entrapment, as Israelis came to see it, was just one aspect of a broader imprisonment as Israel, aware that these larger designs were foundering, nevertheless continued to find it hugely difficult to abandon the positions which it had occupied in pursuit of them. Twenty years ago Menachem Begin, the Likud prime minister, had taken up Anwar Sadat's offer of peace, but not, it swiftly turned out, as a stepping stone to agreements with Israel's other enemies. Instead he moved to confront them, first diluting his commitment to Palestinian autonomy, on which Sadat had set such store, then annexing the Golan Heights, and then allowing his defence minister, Ariel Sharon, to invade Lebanon with the object of destroying the PLO. The grand plan, at least for Sharon, did not end there. Sharon's hope was to change Lebanon into a Maronite-run satellite and then, by shifting Palestinians into Jordan, to bring about the fall of that kingdom and its replacement by a Palestinian state, into which much of the West Bank and Gaza population could be decanted. This mad scheme was soon in ruins, but in a way the retreat from it ended only yesterday, when the last Israeli soldiers pulled out. Even before these developments, Sadat, in one of his meetings in Cairo with the Israeli ambassador, had been so angered by Begin's growing betrayal of their compact that he kept repeating: \"May God forgive you, O Menachem!\" Avi Shlaim, the Israeli historian who records this incident in his compelling survey of Israel's relationship with the Arabs over the last half-century, shows how Begin took a course in 1981 and 1982 whose disastrous consequences are still apparent today. It is also to be recorded that many Israeli politicians, officials and soldiers were doubtful or opposed, but, as so often in that nation's history, did not prevail. Even Begin was misled by the wilful Sharon and came to regret the Lebanon war deeply. Yet what was done was done. The decision, in spite of his promises to Sadat, to refuse any meaningful autonomy or self-government to the Palestinians has shaped Likud policy, and influenced that of the Labour party, up to Netanyahu and beyond. The decision to annex the Golan set the hostile relationship with Syria in concrete and helped create a proxy theatre of war in southern Lebanon. The invasion of Lebanon brought into being a political and military force, Hizbullah, that over the years became a much more effective foe than the PLO had been on that front. Hizbullah turned out to be so tough, in fact, that Israel's surrogate, the Christian militia it supported, could not manage on its own. More and more the Israelis had to steel themselves to the steady loss of their own young men. The story of Israel and the Middle East in the past two decades has been of halting and painful attempts to reverse the Israeli decisions of the early 80s. They were, in Yehoshafat Harkabi's phrase, \"fateful\" decisions, and showed, as that astute former head of Israeli military intelligence remarked, that Israel was not so much a victim of others as it was of its own illusions. Through all this time Israelis have shown a growing awareness that their policies are in the long term untenable, infuriatingly combined with a refusal to pay the necessary price for peace. Oslo allowed progress toward agreement with the Palestinians to begin. That progress, however, was undermined by Binyamin Netanyahu, perhaps the supreme example of the Israeli tendency to believe that peace can be secured without concessions. But then came Ehud Barak, and many, in Israel and abroad, thought he carried with him the key to final settlements with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese. It seemed that at last the mischief of 1981 and 1982 would be undone. But Barak has proved to be a conjuror who, as the Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea has written, constantly suggested he could do the trick, but never actually did it. Trying to balance an undisciplined coalition, he could not offer Syria the complete restitution of territory in the Golan that President Assad, for his own compelling political reasons, naturally demanded. Resolving nevertheless to go ahead with his promise to get the boys out of Lebanon, but now without agreement with the Syrians or the Lebanese, he saw the withdrawal degenerate into a run for the border. Israel's Christian allies, about to be abandoned without even a half-baked deal on their future, not unexpectedly started to fold and, with no buffer left, the Israelis had to get out fast. The scuttle in prospect had already pumped up Palestinian street protest, at a high level anyway because Barak had left certain key concessions too late. The Golan, the Lebanon, and the Palestinian lands are as interconnected today as they were in 1981. Lining them up again in a manageable sequence, a sequence in which agreement follows agreement until a general peace is attained, is not impossible, but it is not going to be easy. • martin.woollacott@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/may/28/poetry","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-27T23:43:34Z","webTitle":"The elegy and the ecstasy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/28/poetry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/may/28/poetry","fields":{"headline":"The elegy and the ecstasy","bodyText":"How many buyers of Heaney's Beowulf translation have yet got as far as the funeral pyre? Long poems, although honoured on the bookshelf, are felt to be hard going for the contemporary reader. Now Douglas Dunn steps out to dare his audience with The Donkey's Ears (Faber £8.99), 172 pages of abba-rhymed quatrains about the Russian navy's voyage from the Baltic to its destruction by the Japanese navy at the battle of Tsushima in 1905. Dunn's narrator is Flag-Engineer Politovsky, who is caught up in an imperial adventure that dramatises the decay of Tsarist Russia. On a voyage of this kind nothing can be hidden. Politovsky's letters to his wife Sophie reveal his anguish at their separation, the texture of their love, his fears for this ramshackle navy, the inadequacies of the ship, the hopelessness of their captains, and the brutalities of conscript life. He conjures up the claustrophobia of the ships, and the bizarreness of their landfalls. It's a journey towards death, and against that backdrop each scene has the clarity of a lightning-strike. The Donkey's Ears is a wonderful story, told in poetry that fuses driving narrative, politics, choice imagery and the passionate inner life of a man who knows that no engineering talent can patch up the obsolete fleet of Imperial Russia. C.K. Williams has the courage to take his time and allow his characteristic long line to unfold the inner lives of his subjects. Repair, (Bloodaxe £7.99, pp70) his latest collection, won the Pulitzer Prize. He has a searching, humane imagination, and his anecdotes burn deep, starting from such places as the 'cheap, printed, pulpy, seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts' that women wore as housedresses in his childhood, and the curlers which they '...seemed constantly to have in their hair,/ in preparation for some great event, a ball, one would think, that never came to pass.' ('The Dress') Williams is the laureate of those whose great events don't come to pass, but who keep on getting ready for them anyway. Like Dunn, he is essentially a political poet in the richest sense of that word. Thom Gunn's America is also a place of loss and elegy. Like Catullus, a poet whom in some ways he resembles, Gunn is engaged in an erotic, undercover war against time and death. Each poem in Boss Cupid (Faber, £7.99, pp115) makes its report from the latest battleground, where Aids has multiplied the attritions of sexual love: He seemed all body, such As normally you couldn't touch, Reckless and rough, One of Boss Cupid's red-haired errand boys Who couldn't get there fast enough.' ('The Problem') In Gunn's poems, death closes everything, and is close at hand. Some poets aren't happy until they have made something redemptive out of this, but Gunn sees what he sees, and makes it visible. His lovers aren't on their way to any epiphany. They're just caught in the sexiness of being alive: Peter Redgrove is Laurentian in his hunger for the natural world, and his ability to lay it down in words. Redgrove has been pouring poetry into the world for more than 40 years, with a recklessness that cares no more about the odd bad poem than a river cares about the flotsam it shoulders into backwaters. The poet melts into the landscape, all his senses alert: He gripped the fruit And it buzzed like a gong stilled with his fingers And a wasp flew out with its note From the gong of sugar and scented rain ('Orchard with Wasps') Redgrove's Selected Poems (Cape Poetry, £8.99, pp136) are an excellent fix on this very prolific poet. The compression of his life's work emphasises the power of the poetry. He is considered a visionary, but this selection highlights his fineness of touch, and his humour. All the flies are reading microscopic books: They hold themselves quite tense and silent With shoulders hunched, legs splayed out On the white formica table-top, reading. Jamie McKendrick's marble fly in Sky Nails: Selected Poems (Faber £8.9, pp115) neither moves nor reads. It is 'perfectly preserved and just / a shade larger than life-size / and much stiller than life and harder'. This fly is part of a wall relief, which records and preserves everything of the animal kingdom. Except, of course, its life. McKendrick's poems tease thought. The fly will never be caught, because it has already been caught by its sculptor. It has been overwhelmed by stone much as the creatures of Pompeii will be overwhelmed by molten rock, or, as McKendrick observes: It can't have been long after that much the same idea occurred to Vesuvius. ('The Marble Fly') McKendrick is a prize-winning and highly regarded poet but a lot of readers are still missing out on his work. The best of his poems, like the marble fly, are sculpted to last. Poets stay young for a long time. It's one of the best bits of the business, the way a poet can be so described at 40 or at 45. But Matthew Sweeney, in his latest collection A Smell of Fish (Cape £8.00, pp64), is having none of it. The poet's daughter may be off to the pub in red velvet hipsters with the bass guitarist boyfriend, but it's no good Sweeney thinking he can join in. In Prague, he feels the same: I need that blue train to spirit me south, away from Prague and its appetites, the young in one another's laps, clothes in disarray ('The Blue Train') Sweeney's poems are like shards of mirror. As you bend to look more closely, they cut. His version from Dante's Inferno, a passage which deals with the damned locked in ice on the floor of Hell, is chilling and possesses a near-demonic energy. It seems that for Sweeney, as for Douglas Dunn, a long poem releases new force in the poet.

But instead, he 'went to Florida because the Daily Mail was delivered to my door by mistake. If my usual paper had turned up I'd be in Germany now'. The Mail was full of adverts for Florida and devoid of any for sunsational fun in Bavaria or fly-drive bargains in Schleswig-Holstein. So the next day, MacLean flies to the state that dangles off the bottom of the US, armed with shorts and sunscreen but no itinerary. He seeks to apply some of his hard-won Teutonic insights to his new destination but soon becomes intrigued by his own intuition and seemingly random choices to stop here or there or turn this way or that. There are plenty of opportunities to examine such profundities as he encounters Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp ('a Historical District since 1992'), the Liberty Correctional Institute and a mermaid in Weeki Wachee. He is propositioned by a hot chick in late-night Miami. He is punched by a German dad in the Believe It Or Not Museum because he refuses to confirm to a German brat the authenticity of the human unicorn (maybe a bit more research on Germans was needed). He helps move an alligator that was squatting in a suburban swimming-pool to the swamps that are disappearing under retirement homes. (It has to be caught again and released three times for the benefit of the local TV crew.) He visits the alleged site of the Garden of Eden (it seems Noah's Ark had been carried by the 'atmospheric drift' from Florida to Mount Ararat). Wherever he goes, he engages with local characters, often adopting tactics that could lead to nasty scrapes if used by someone with less charm. 'I wonder if you can help me. I'm looking for the best person in town. Who's Palatka's good samaritan?' he asks through the bulletproof glass of the police station of the town where he's been told there is 'nothin' and no one good'. Some travel books make you want to 'go there' with the writer. This one makes you pleased he's done it for you. For a month, he spent his time in his own company or that of strangers. Maybe it's easier to be yourself that way. As he returns to Gatwick, MacLean reflects that 'a journey is not a linear thread, as the Cruel Fates would have it, with cause and effect tumbling over each other along its measured length. Rather, it is a spiral, fluid and unfixed, elegant and ephemeral'. Sometimes, the journey is not just about travel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/may/28/features.magazine47","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-28T01:02:44Z","webTitle":"Italian stallion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/features.magazine47","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/features.magazine47","fields":{"headline":"Italian stallion","bodyText":"Ferrari. And before another word is said, a cacophonous mechanical kingdom is conjured in the mind's eye, and mind's ear. Of sensuous, blood-red machines, improbably powerful engines that howl with vulpine intensity. Of breathtaking speed. Of Manchester United's training ground at Carrington crowded with the road-going symbols of success of Beckham, Butt, Sheringham, Yorke and co. Of Formula One and racing legends. Of smooth, middle-aged gits balding around Surrey golf lands with leggy tots admiring the cut of their driver's credit card. A string of automotive clichés, in fact, before you've had the privilege of sliding down into the leather-sheathed driving seat of the latest Ferrari 360 Modena. Turn the key, blip the drilled aluminium, racing-style throttle, and catapult yourself along Surrey Tarmac away from Maranello Concessionaries, Ferrari's UK HQ, and away into a magic mystery tour of the fastest A roads and B roads you've ever encountered. Faster than fairies, faster than witches, this silver-grey road-racer beguiles like no other car you'll meet in a year of Sundays. The 360 Modena is quite simply one of the finest cars I've driven, and this includes many older Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Maseratis and De Tomasos. And Jaguars, Porsches and Moss knows what. What this car does so well is prove that a car that would not disgrace itself on a race track can be used as everyday transport, if you're rich and sybaritic enough in spirit and wallet. Not that the 360 is a gas guzzler. It isn't. It's simply beautifully made, mostly of aluminium and thus very light, and for an Italian supercar extraordinary in that it looks and feels as well put together as a Porsche, and that's saying something. A Porsche is one of the most beautifully made machines you can buy with your own money. Not only does the car feel all of a piece, but it's a doddle to drive. No, seriously. Sure, if you're used to Mondeos and Meganes, you might find the stupendous power a little unsettling and the width of the car disturbing (at 6ft 4in, it's among the very widest), but you would soon delight in the way you can overtake everyone in sight at will and in any gear, the way in which the car zips around any corner at virtually any speed you choose with almost no body roll, the hugely powerful brakes, the go-kart steering and the blissful comfort of the seats. Beyond this, the interior is wonderfully moulded and stitched together, the exquisite testa rossa (red-headed) V8 engine visible behind the driver's head, and the air-con works a treat. You really can potter through town in this supremely potent car, sit in jams without fear of the 400bhp engine overheating, and cope easily with a clutch that is neither heavy nor sudden. Is this too much of a good thing? Shouldn't a Ferrari be a snarling, flame-haired bitch of a car, a popping, spitting machine that is only rightly happy at grossly illegal speeds screaming like a banshee up and down twisting mountain roads as if the devil (or the polizia) was on its tail-pipes? Yes and no. While it will lug around town in top gear, the 360 will, should you want it to, move with a speed and dexterity that will delight aficionados and quietly terrify those who might find it hard to believe that a car really can be so quick through corners, up hills and over humpbacks. Unlike other very fast cars, its tyres do not 'tramtrack' on rough roads, nor under heavy braking. It has no Jekyll-and-Hyde character whatsoever. It simply does faster and faster without ever losing its composure (as long as you don't lose yours). There is, though, a 'traction control' system that ensures every driver should manage their first fast turn in this car without embarrassing or frightening themselves. When you switch this safety device off, the car can be chucked around, despite its physical bulk, as if it was a Caterham 7. Only its width means that Britain's automotive terrier could get away from the Ferrari on B-roads. There are, dammit, times when discretion gives way to valour and, also because this £103,000 car isn't mine (sadly) and must be returned to its owners without so much as a thumbprint showing on its gleaming Pinifarina-designed bodywork. And, no, this is not a car you will feel embarrassed to drive. It has no fins or spoilers. Aerodynamic testing nurtured a body shape that needs nothing to hold it down. Instead, like a Formula One racer, the 360 hunches down automatically the faster you push it. It never feels as if it is about to take off as E-Types and Lamborghini Miuras have done, in my experience, as they enter two-mile-a-minute territory. I know you're not meant to drive cars this fast and yes, of course, it's all very boyish and so on, but I bet you would want to go very fast indeed, too, if I were able to give you the key to the 360 Modena. For one thing, the sound of the 40-valve engine - titanium con rods, forged aluminium pistons, four camshafts, hydraulic tappets_ phwoarr_ is as compelling as any fast movement from the great Ludwig Van. Sorry, I'm getting a bit carried away, but you try and curb your passion when let loose in what must be, by most standards, one of the finest and fastest road cars ever built. There are, however, several snags with the 360. The price, for one, unless you're a dot.com teenage trillionaire in which case you can afford to buy Fiat which own Ferrari several times over and have change to buy Porsche, too. Then there's the parking. You need a lot of space and bottle to park a Ferrari in the street. Do you dare to? Naturally, every Modena sold features a hidden global satellite tracking devise. If stolen, the car can be found anywhere in the world. It works, as several lucky Ferrari owners know to their advantage. The other snag is the waiting list: two-and-half-years. Still, by that time I might have decided to grow a goatee, talk mockney, wear combat trousers, design a web-site and, hey presto, have made a trillion pounds. Or, perhaps not. Whatever. The 360 Modena is a superb machine, a mechanical jewel and proof that the car as we've known it pretty much for a century has plenty of life in it yet. It must seem decadent to have driven to Liverpool in a Ferrari to give a talk in a parish church (my journey from London took six hours, though I did go via Oxford, Broadway, the Elan Valley, Welshpool, Chester, Birkenhead and the wonderful Mersey Tunnel rather than taking the M1/M6), but this magnificent car makes motoring as much fun as it was when I first got my licence. It just happens to cost about 2,000 times what I paid for my first car. Certain pleasures get much more expensive as the miles reel by."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/may/28/1","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-28T01:02:46Z","webTitle":"Behind the Aryan curtain...","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/1","fields":{"headline":"Behind the Aryan curtain...","bodyText":"Kingdom of the Soul: Symbolist Art in Germany 1870-1920 Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, until 30 July No artist has ever suffered a plunge in reputation quite so sudden or so steep as the Swiss-born symbolist Arnold Böcklin, the leading painter of his adoptive Germany in the late-nineteenth century. He was as famous as those who acclaimed him - Nietzsche, Brahms, Schopenhauer and Munch, who called him 'the sacred flame' of German art. Every self-respecting burgher owned a copy of his masterwork, Island of Death, in which a white-robed priest ferries a corpse over Stygian waters to a mausoleum raked by moonlight. In its day, the picture was as familiar as the opening chords of Beethoven's Fifth; it was the Mona Lisa of German painting. When Böcklin died in 1901, Richard Strauss wrote the funeral hymn and the world's press rushed to eulogise 'the founder of a new yearned-for art'. One year later, however, the artist was disparaged as a pedlar of kitsch; two years later he was vilified in a book, The Böcklin Case, as the witting stooge of a chauvinist state. It didn't help that his main champions were nationalists. The sacred flame waned fast. Apart from a stint in the Thirties, Böcklin's work was rarely seen in European museums until his rehabilitation in the late Seventies. So what did for Böcklin? The Nazis, of course, who commandeered Böcklin and many of his peers for the Führer's pantheon of approved artists. But even before this posthumous patronage contaminated his career, there was another force which effectively deleted German symbolism from the history of art. This was the overwhelming tendency of the world's museums, even before impressionism set the seal, to favour French over German painting. A symbolist, according to this bias, was a nervy Parisian dreamer; not some coarse provincial labouring in a Bavarian forest. Kingdom of the Soul is the first show of German symbolism ever to be staged in Britain - or indeed Germany, where its European tour began. Given the circumstances, it could hardly fail to surprise: from Böcklin's alarming melodramas to Klinger's phantasmagoria and Zwintscher's eerie nightscapes, there are almost 200 works by 60 artists, most of them unknown in this country. Seen together, they amount to a visual opera performed at full-volume blast. Symbolism, a vague term in itself, is all about the gradual evocation of mood as opposed to the clear description of fact. In France, this produced an effete iconography of wilting flowers, floating wraiths, unicorns and the jewel-dripping fantasies of Gustav Moreau. In Germany, it meant everything from golden lads and lasses enjoying a Bavarian Eden to ravens, monsters and haunted chapels, Olympian gods, fallen mortals and shattering visions of the afterlife. Above all - and you see this throughout the show - it meant lonely figures silhouetted on a shore, looking out to sea, yearning for some unattainable land beyond. The unattainable can often be identified with some precision as Italy, Goethe's 'land where the lemon flowers'. More than half of these artists went to Italy and came back infatuated with classical culture. A typical symbolist landscape, as painted by Ferdinand Knab, shows a Roman temple against a heavy northern sky scattered with cawing harbingers. A typical symbolist myth, as painted by Anselm Feuerbach, shows Diana bathing - or it would, if you could make her out in the inky gloom of Feuerbach's Black Forest. In short, the landscape of German symbolism is profoundly Teutonic. The warm South, with its oranges and lemons, becomes the romantic North. Even Hans Thoma's Eden, a paradise of date-palms and parrots, is stricken with a cataract straight out of Caspar David Friedrich. In this context, it's horribly easy to see how symbolism's classical athletes could look to later eyes like Hitler Youth practising eurythmics for the Fatherland. Yet the mood evoked by this art - with some appalling exceptions of Aryan kitsch - is anything but triumphalist. Böcklin's shark-finned Tritan, copulating with a red-eyed Nereid in a dark convulsive sea, still seems frightening. Max Klinger's etchings of the afterlife - as a black canyon into which we are hurled by death - send shivers of foreboding across the mind. Klinger, who is very much the star of this show, painted a Crucifixion in which the figure of Christ is entirely, distressingly naked. It caused a sensation in 1870 and it still seems properly shocking today. But it turns out to be consistent with so much of this art, which never shies from full-on male nudity, female eroticism and all-out release of the irrational, emotional psyche. German symbolism is routinely diagnosed as a reaction to Bismarck's modernised, materialist state. But that doesn't begin to explain the astonishing variety of this show, which runs all the way from Klinger's magnificent bust of the glowering Nietzsche to Richard Muller's jackbooted skeletons and Franz Von Stuck's soft-porn tat. This variety even devolves to the micro-level of a single career. Von Stuck, for example, can surprise you with a single, incisive etching. Böcklin veers from the late romanticism of his Self-Portrait with Death to the Hammer-horror schlock of his ruined chapel. It may be that there is no clear definition of symbolist art, nothing to connect the flimsy fantasies of Moreau with the durable power of Klinger's etchings. But Böcklin seems to have identified some of the characteristics of German symbolism, wittingly or not, when he said that art should tell a story, as much as literature, and that it should aim for the resonance of music. Island of Death inspired Rachmaninov, Strindberg, Dali and Hesse. De Chirico acknowledged a lifelong debt to Böcklin. Look at Zwintscher's painted paradoxes and you see the makings of Magritte; look at Liepold's Gateway to the Cosmos and you see the graphic art of the Seventies prefigured. As this enthralling, if long-delayed show reveals, German symbolism is a crucial missing chapter in the story of art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2000/may/28/life1.lifemagazine6","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-28T01:02:51Z","webTitle":"The loafer's guide to popular culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/life1.lifemagazine6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/may/28/life1.lifemagazine6","fields":{"headline":"The loafer's guide to popular culture","bodyText":"Who is he? Denmark's nuttiest filmmaker. Oh, and Palme d'Or winner at this year's Cannes. For what?

Universally hailed as a work of genius, etc? Not quite. While the jury obviously loved it, the critics were poleaxed, one calling it 'less Pennies From Heaven than Springtime for Hitler', while others bandied about words like 'ridiculous', 'terrible' and 'lamentable'.

Far from it.

So, like a former prince of Denmark, he likes to put an antic disposition on? Something like that. He's known to get naked himself when filming nude scenes, believed when young that if household objects weren't placed in certain places there would be a nuclear holocaust, and countered a pathological fear of flying by driving down to Cannes in his VW camper van.

'Too bloody true, mate,' one is tempted to comment in the wake of an investigation into certain less than savoury cellar practices at the company's headquarters. It was student winemakers visiting from California who first made the allegations about 'illegal and unethical' winemaking techniques. Kingston, it has since been confirmed, did indeed use the banned substance silver nitrate to remove the smell of hydrogen sulphide (rotten eggs) from some of its wines. Silver nitrate sounds worse than it is, mind you. It is a perfectly legal additive in some countries, and the quantities found in the offending wines were well below the levels accepted for tap water. All the same, this is a (minor) scandal the wine industry could do without. Or perhaps it isn't. First, the Aussies dealt with the matter openly and quickly. Secondly, the publicity about silver nitrate might make us think a little more carefully about how wine is produced in general. It is a common misconception that wine is a natural product. But without chemicals, it is almost impossible to make drinkable wine. Ban sulphur dioxide as a legal additive, for example, and most wine would taste as flat as the Argentine pampas. Nevertheless, some wines are more natural than others. This is especially true in the vineyard, where organic and bio-dynamic producers eschew pesticides and herbicides (though not copper sulphate). This doesn't make them better winemakers, but it does mean their wines are 'greener'. The Kingston affair could undermine the public's trust in 'conventional' winemaking. And I'm not only talking about silver nitrate here. Just as bad, in my view, was Kingston's legal but not exactly wholesome use of grapeskins to colour white juice (and sell it as red wine). If you're worried about such developments, there are two alternatives. The first is to spend a little more on a bottle of wine (cheap plonk producers are often forced to trim corners). The second is to buy an organically certified wine. There's only one snag here: establishing authenticity. Not every winery that claims to be organic has been certified by one of the confusing array of organic bodies. Life would be much easier if there was a single accepted standard for organic wine. But don't hold your breath. Confused? You wait until you start trying to understand EU regulation 2092/21 and the workings of the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards. My advice is to invest in a copy of two really good books about organic wine: Friends of the Earth Organic Wine Guide by Monty Waldin (£8.99, Thorsons) and The Great Organic Wine Guide by Hilary Wright (£8.99, Piatkus), both of them full of wines that play by the rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/2000/may/29/northernireland.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-29T01:04:48Z","webTitle":"Peace first.

The peace process is saved: mainland Britain switches its attention over to England against Brazil: Peter Mandelson prepares to concentrate on the next election campaign. A crisis averted becomes inside page news for yesterday's papers. This is politics as usual, which disguises the fact that there is nothing usual about Northern Irish politics. What, for instance, would any normal party leader do if his deputy drifted off to Taiwan for the vital days of decision-forming? What would Blair do to Prescott? He would drop big John into oblivion from a great height, not greet him home and fete him as some mighty prophet. Yet John Taylor, preened with self-importance, is hailed merely because he agrees to support his boss. You don't have to be loyal to be a loyalist. Jeffrey Donaldson and the rejectionists, playing to a bizarre audience of 860 grandees, won't give up. Paisley's DUP will probably stalk away from the reconvened assembly and rail outside the walls. Even without the IRA's dumps of mystic verbiage, words put beyond use where Cyril Ramaphosa keeps his dictionary, the scope for trouble remains almost infinite. It is painfully easy, amid such confusion, just to recite the word \"process\" as some kind of mantra and to forget what it means. Pause, though. What is this peace process? It is a formula for reconciliation and quiet on the streets. It puts London and Dublin in a settled context. It persuades once mortal enemies to sit side by side as ministerial colleagues, deciding about jobs and schools and hospitals. By this transference of power, too, it seeks to make Ulster politics real at last, freed from a time warp of rhetoric and opposition posturings: the most necessary devolution of the lot. But here there are other connections. Real politics also means winning and losing elections. It means change to the pulse of democracy - the eventual boot for Blair, the rise of the pensioner's friend. It involves ebb and flow. We know that already from the matching devolutions of the last three years. Alun Michael has ebbed for ever. Donald Dewar may soon be gone with the flow. If you give voters assemblies and executives to elect, the voters become sovereign. You may make it difficult for them by installing the drag anchors of proportional representation: Scotland and Wales have those. They're stuck, by design, with coalition administrations. They, though, can change the weighting of those coalitions and the faces who front them. One fine day, there'll be a Scots Nat chief minister in Edinburgh. One predictable day, Labour will be cut out of the Cardiff action. The question for Belfast, the hole in the heart of this process, is where the reality of politics bites there. Let's assume that the assembly is back in business, stronger than before because of the worsting of Donaldson and the guarantees of the IRA. Trimble and his other (useful) deputy, Seamus Mallon, resume work: Martin McGuinness is more interested in A level results than Armalite stocks. That, crucially, is the first base camp of reconciliation. Everybody who stood for election and still wants to play has a guaranteed part of the action. Badmouthing the British government doesn't stop the leaks in school roofs or improve ambulance response times. The focus inevitably shifts to practical policies and their delivery. Who cares about the Battle of the Boyne when there are jobs wanted now? Getting there: got that. You could tell, even from the first few weeks of assembly life, how power and accountability can alter perspectives. (It's the old Yasser Arafat test: make him responsible for clean tap water and electrical supplies and he is seen in a different light.) The practical politicisation of politicians is the underpinning of peace. But how, thereafter, does Northern Ireland move on the next camp, to the stage where leaking school roofs or job losses bring electoral retribution? The difficulty with the Good Friday agreement is that it doesn't know: it never envisages a Bad Saturday. Our old chum d'Hondt, with his mathematical system to share out the fruits of proportional representation, operates relentlessly. The assembly, monitored by equality commissioners, has inclusion engraved on its founding statutes. If you're one of the chosen 108, you have a stake: you have to register as a nationalist or a unionist or something other and your vote matters, by parallel consent or weighted majority, in the choice of every committee, every chairman, every minister. It seems an odd question to put, but where is the opposition in such a controlled, infinitely balanced arena? Answer: except for Paisley, stomping on the lawn outside, there won't be an opposition that matters. The big boys within the walls are yoked together for all Good Fridays. We ought to be clear that that fix, however essential it currently seems, is also a terrible snare. It freezes the religious divides and histories in another time warp. It makes party labels the key to power and seals them in their own little boxes. It purposely delays the moment when the Unionists or Sinn Fein or the SDLP will look out from their own sectarian audiences and begin to match their policies to the orientations of London or of Dublin. In short, to practise the real politics which can free Northern Ireland from its infernal cocoon. I want to see Sinn Fein's policy bag emptied on to the floor for wider inspection so that I can see how its old collection of sub-Marxist nostrums is changing (just as the ANC in South Africa has changed). I want to hear about hospital waiting lists and bobbies on the beat. I want to see David Trimble and Gerry Adams locked in debate about gay rights. I want a relevance which doesn't end at the ferry terminal. I would even (ye gods!) love a good row over the euro. The latest wobbly triumph of Trimble is a million miles from such mundane joys. It is still locked in its own, claustrophobic cage, still absorbed with the symbolism of flags and guns fallen silent but not destroyed: the whether, not the how. In mainland Britain, we have handed in all our guns, because that is the law. In Belfast, the legacy of Dunblane doesn't count. The debate remains wholly internalised. Devolution, within the United Kingdom, means finding a different kind of balance. It means finding a matching political system that fits. It means the political ability to talk about the same things in the same tone of voice and to exact the same kind of electoral punishment in failure. That is the only real culmination of what we glibly call the \"peace process\". A new rhythm and new beginning which one distant day may be called normality.

The German foreign minister's appeal for a swift move to pan-European voting, constitution and all, caught them unawares. On the other hand they do not warm to Tony Blair's neo-liberal vision of a \"flexible\" Europe - which carried the day at the Lisbon summit (though they must wonder how far France's success in adapting to the internet age comes despite not because of French state practice and socialist policy). On security and defence, it is French unwillingness, which the United Kingdom shares, to give up the trappings and pretensions of great power status that helps explain the lack of movement since Xavier de Solana was appointed special commissioner last year. But it is the issue of enlarging the EU that exposes the French most cruelly. Inside the next six months, prior to the summit planned for year's end in Nice, they have either to tell the candidates from east-central Europe effectively to forget it or else accelerate the process of redrafting Europe's constitution to breakneck speed. So far Paris has shown no aptitude for either. Joschka Fischer said his enthusiasm for a great European leap forward was personal, but he carries a chunk of the German political class with him. Paris was nonplussed. After all, it used to be the French - Giscard, Delors, Mitterrand - who decided when and where the engine moved. Neither prime minister Lionel Jospin nor President Chirac are conviction \"Europeans\". Both have lately been discomfited by restless natives - Charles Pasqua and former followers of the Front National at Mr Chirac's shoulder, the left-wing nationalist, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, blowing raspberries at Mr Jospin's cabinet table. Now their discomfort becomes internationally visible, sandwiched as they are between German willingness to consider a profound shift in political power and the scepticism of London and the Scandinavians. (Political instability in Rome means the Italians bring nothing to the party; it is possible the French may have to contend with Silvio Berlusconi as head of an emphatically right-wing coalition.) Paris exhibits a similar discomfort in global affairs. French left and right toy with anti-Americanism but know that constructing a European alternative - one with its own version of market capitalism, with its own defence and security interests, for which it is prepared to fight - means submerging French sovereignty, including opposition to UK beef imports. Paris must now stage-manage an intergovernmental conference leading to a new treaty. Its main subject is how the EU operates if enlargement goes ahead. Mr Fischer has as good as said: formalise a Europe that moves in its different blocs at different speeds. Admit the Poles, Hungarians and others to an outer dimension, while a streamlined federal entity is created at Europe's (Franco-German) core. The logic says: either slow enlargement to a pace compatible with the EU's present governance, or allow expansion eastwards to happen on condition there are huge changes to the way Europe works. The first of these would require the French to tell the Poles to wait for full accession. The second demands from Paris outward-looking imagination of a kind that the Chirac-Jospin cohabitation has so far lacked. Perhaps there was a time of continental lassitude when Tony Blair might have seized the EU's leadership. If so, the moment has passed. The French now have the reins, even if they are unlikely to jerk the beast into new life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/may/30/thatcher.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-30T01:34:04Z","webTitle":"Tories go a'courting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/30/thatcher.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/may/30/thatcher.uk","fields":{"headline":"Tories go a'courting","bodyText":"This could be the week future historians mark as the start of pensioner pulling power. For the second time within a week, the Tories have produced a package specially tailored to those over retirement age. The latest offering, from a party which wants to cut taxation, includes six separate extra spending commitments. After decades of being ignored, with only tiny numbers of MPs present as earnings indices and other pension entitlements were whittled away, the pensioner lobby is not only being noticed but actively courted. What is going on? After Labour's disastrous local election results in May, surveys suggested the one issue defeated candidates blamed was the tiny pension uprating this year - a mere 75p a week. Fundamental factors are also at work, the most important of them demographic. Retired people are increasing in number. The population bulge which created the youth culture of the 1960s is beginning to retire. There is nothing deferential about this generation; they are accustomed to asserting their rights. Unlike their predecessors, they do not feel particularly grateful for the welfare state. They have known nothing else. Moreover, private polling by the Tories suggests they resent Tony Blair's projecting the United Kingdom as a young country. Of course the opposition is being opportunist. The same William Hague now promising to restore war widows' pensions to 2,500 women who lost it by re-marrying explicitly ruled this option out while he was a social security minister in 1995. Similar opportunities to introduce the new promises - extending invalid-care allowances to the over-60s, expanding breast screening to the over-65s, abolishing mixed-sex wards - were ignored by previous Tory administrations. But pensioners should ignore the opportunism and celebrate their coming of age. Indeed, cross-party peers have already amended the current pensions bill to give back war pensions to widows who remarry. What the pensioner lobby should examine is how they could make themselves more influential. Grey power has always been more successful in the United States through having a single association which caters for all needs of the retired from travel to politics. Hence its success in introducing an anti-age discrimination act 30 years ago, something for which the UK still awaits. It is time for Age Concern, Help the Aged and Saga to unite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2000/may/31/guardiansocietysupplement5","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2000-05-31T14:50:07Z","webTitle":"Carry on regardless","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/may/31/guardiansocietysupplement5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/may/31/guardiansocietysupplement5","fields":{"headline":"Carry on regardless","bodyText":"In the past, the public was perhaps more inclined to accept a culture where the doctor or nurse \"knew best\". But recent events have powerfully challenged this perception, and a simple clause in the new NHS act could see the biggest shake-up ever in these arrangements. The cases of the Bristol cardiac service, where two doctors were removed from the medical register, and the case of Dr Harold Shipman, the murderous Hyde GP, have shocked the public. Nursing, in recent years, has also had its share of scandal. Beverly Allitt, the children's nurse who killed babies, did little to instil public confidence, and a recent decision to restore to the register a male nurse who had previously raped elderly women patients caused controversy. Since late Victorian times, the health professions have been allowed the privilege of governing their own affairs. This is done through statutory instruments, approved by parliament, which created the bodies that regulate doctors, nurses and various therapists - bodies such as the General Medical Council (GMC), the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing (UKCC) and the Council for the Professions Supplementary to Medicine (CPSM). These august bodies are large, with between 60 and 100 members - a majority of whom get there by election from within the professions and the rest arriving by a combination of nomination by the great and good and appointment by the secretary of state for health. In theory, the job of these bodies is quite clear: they are there to protect the public from rogue or negligent practitioners. Their ultimate power is to remove a professional from the state register, thus debarring them from practice. Historically, all these bodies have had an in-built majority of professionals sitting on their governing councils. The problem with current self-regulation arrangements lies in the domination of these councils and their procedures by the professions themselves. In short, if you have a usurious complaint, the professional complained against is judged predominantly by his or her peers. The public is rightly beginning to question the independence of such arrangements. These bodies are also slow and cumbersome in embracing change, often through no fault of their own. Before the 1999 NHS act, any government wanting to change the law governing these professions had to go through a laborious process of preparing and enacting complex primary legislation. Even assuming that parliamentary time could be found, the process of changing law usually took years. The 1999 act changes all that. In future, the government can bring about rapid change by, first, consulting legitimate interested parties. Having consulted, the government can now pass changes through the privy council. And, once approved, proposed changes can be laid in the form of an order before parliament in a matter of weeks, and then pass swiftly into law. I hope that the government will be bold in using these new provisions to alter radically the shape and scope of these regulatory arrangements. Why should bodies like the GMC or UKCC be dominated by professionals? In today's world, where health care becomes more complex and the public rightly demands more involvement in decisions about their health, should the public not have a greater say in governing these professions? The councils of important bodies should have half of the seats filled by lay representatives, nominated by a wide cross-section of public organisations and by the public themselves. If governance of these professions was seen to be shared by a legitimate professional input, matched by an equal voice on behalf of the public, a true sense of balanced partnership could emerge. The public could draw far more confidence from such arrangements in protecting their interests when things go badly wrong. There is a perception that the current arrangements are stacked in favour of the professions, that vested self-interests might dominate at the expense of proper public protection. The 1999 act allows for rapid and bold change. Alan Milburn, the secretary of state, has recently used these new powers in a limited way with the GMC role in governing doctors. Let's hope that, if the government wins a second term, Blair is prepared to go further and use the act to rebuild public confidence in the health professions. • Ray Rowden is a registered nurse and visiting professor in the department of health studies at the University of York.

It has been an extraordinary series in which terrorists, soldiers, politicians and spies have spoken frankly about the last 30 years in a troubled corner of the United Kingdom. Only a journalist of his standing could have persuaded people from all sides of this conflict to cooperate in such a manner. The result was a first rate piece of journalism. It was also first rate history. Much that has hitherto been obscure or hidden was revealed or clarified for the first time. More satisfying still, the programmes also felt as though they were some part of a process of truth and reconciliation. There was a feeling of closure in the way that former enemies were willing to speak about their spent hatreds and grim deeds. Apart from what the series told us about Northern Ireland there are two wider points to be made. One is about the BBC. The entire series took five years to make. It was never going to reach a mass audience (though many serious newspapers and magazines would be pleased to reach its audience of 1.5m). It involved thousands of hours of research, a hundred hours of filming and, in Peter Taylor's case, a lifetime of contacts and reading. It is no coincidence that the other outstanding documentary series of the past five years, Norma Percy's The Death of Yugoslavia, was also commissioned and shown by the BBC. Every time a Murdoch tabloid sneers at the BBC, remember these two series. There is still such a thing as serious television journalism in this country and it appears to be increasingly pointless to expect it any more from ITV. There was some small irony that the last episode of Mr Taylor's series coincided with the Independent Television Commission asking whether public service broadcasting can be sustained - or is even \"needed\" - any longer on commercial channels. The second point concerns the role of journalists in informing citizens about what the security services do in their name. Peter Taylor had no cooperation from the Ministry of Defence in tracking down and speaking to former members of the intelligence community in Northern Ireland. Some of those he did trace were warned against speaking to him, with the threat of ostracism or financial penalty. We can confidently predict that those who defied these threats will not be prosecuted. Mr Taylor's reputation for responsible film-making is so well established that it would be madness to pick on those who cooperated with him. Colonel Nigel Wylde, a holder of the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his work in Northern Ireland, is less fortunate. He is currently being prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly helping the author Tony Geraghty with research. The MoD has nine injunctions in place against former soldiers preventing them from publishing books or speaking out. The government also has an injunction preventing the Sunday Times and its Irish correspondent Liam Clarke from writing about collusion between army intelligence officers and Loyalists. The Guardian and its sister paper, the Observer, are both being pursued by the police to hand over material which might incriminate the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. The former head of MI5, Stella Rimington, is being demonised for writing an account of her time in the security services. A secret offshoot of the cabinet office's joint intelligence committee, chaired by a diplomat, Michael Pakenham, is reported to be behind these Draconian attempts to pursue individuals, with Mr Blair's blessing. At the same time the government is passing still further laws jeopardising journalists working in this area. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill extends existing bugging and tapping powers to all forms of communication, including mobile phones, emails and pictures sent electronically. The police would find it much easier to acquire data, including addresses of emails sent and received as well as websites hit and browsed by journalists, who could then no longer guarantee the security and identity of their sources. The Terrorism Bill, also going through the Lords, makes it an offence for anyone - including journalists - not to disclose to the police any information obtained about the activities or intentions of \"terrorists\", or those they suspect of being \"terrorists\" - a term capable of very broad definition. All this is on top of a \"Freedom of Information\" Bill exempting all disclosures about the security services as well as any information which \"would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs\". Labour's FoI Act would have been no help to Peter Taylor. He could, in future, be prosecuted under no fewer than three further acts for the sort of programmes he makes. This government may have few liberal instincts. But self-preservation alone should surely hold it back from alienating every single journalist in the land by its current coordinated assaults on free speech."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/jun/01/news2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-01T09:14:43Z","webTitle":"June 1: In brief and casting news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jun/01/news2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jun/01/news2","fields":{"headline":"June 1: In brief and casting news","bodyText":"• Jodie Foster has moved swiftly to deny mushrooming speculation (triggered by a report in the Daily Mirror) that she is pregnant with her second child.

Successive results show it has a comfortable lead over the Tories when people are asked how they would vote if an election were to be held now. This position held since the general election in May 1997. But why then does Labour keep losing - the European parliament last year, May's council contests and London's new government? The ready explanation is that while electors tell pollsters they prefer Labour, when it comes to casting a vote Labour supporters are reluctant to turn out and do the deed. As part of an Economic and Social Research Council programme on the state of democracy in the United Kingdom we have been examining participation. We asked people to assess the likelihood of their voting at the next general election on a scale from one to ten. Some 71% were categorised as likely voters (with a rating from eight to ten), which is fairly close to the proportion who actually did turn out in 1997. If we compare the size of this group of likely voters across the parties, clear differences emerge in the relationship between support and voting intention. Interestingly enough the nationalists have the most determined backers. Some 94% of their supporters fall into this \"likely to vote\" group. The Tories are enthusiasts, too: some 87% of their supporters are likely to vote. Liberal Democrats came third with 85%. Labour, in contrast, came a clear fourth with only 80% of their supporters in the likely to vote category. Differences in willingness to vote have clear electoral effects as can be seen by applying these proportions to the results of the Guardian/ ICM poll published on May 16. The table sums it up. Labour's lead over the Tories in that survey was 7%. If we adjust the figures for differences in the likelihood that people will vote, according to our model Labour's lead has to be cut to 3%. The adjusted figures include non-voters (those who we assessed as unlikely to turn out). They expressed a party preference to interviewers but most of them are unlikely to translate that preference into a cross on a ballot paper one bright morn in May 2001 or whenever. These figures tell us why Labour cannot translate the poll leads it keeps chalking up into victories in real contests. To be fair, there are other recent polls which give Labour a larger lead over the Tories than the Guardian/ ICM survey. But the same need for adjustment applies to them too, namely that polls need to be tempered for the willingness of electors to turn out and vote - if we are to get an accurate picture of the standing of the parties in actual elections. The evidence also shows clearly how big a problem Labour has in its heartlands. In the southeast of England outside London, some 82% of respondents fall into the \"likely to vote\" category. In Leeds and Hull they are lethargic. In Yorkshire and Humberside only 65% are in this category. A similar point can be made about Scotland with 75% likely to vote; in the northwest of England 73% are in this group. An extra discount has to be applied to parliamentary seats in these regions because the Tories who live there appear to be more willing to vote than Labour supporters. As a consequence Labour is more likely to lose marginal seats in these areas than in other parts of the country. Since there is also a tendency for working-class people to turn out less than white collar workers, class and geography combine to reduce Labour support in these areas. Why is this happening? The most popular explanation is that differential turnout reflects disaffection with New Labour's delivery of policies, particularly in relation to the NHS and education. Surprisingly there is not much evidence to support this idea in our survey. There is little difference in turnouts between individuals who think that the government is doing a good job in health and education and those who think it is doing a bad job. However, just over a fifth of Labour supporters think that the government has done a bad job in managing the economy and they are much less likely to vote than Labour supporters who think that it is doing a good job. The latter group, who are satisfied with the government's performance on the economy, greatly outnumber the dissatisfied but there are enough Labour supporters who dislike Gordon Brown's policies to bring down turnouts. Most interesting of all is the fact that 28% of Labour supporters think that the government is not being honest and is not trustworthy. Supporters who think this are very much less likely to vote compared with those who think the opposite. So it appears that a combination of generalised disaffection among a minority of Labour supporters over the handling of the economy, coupled with a belief by a larger group that the government cannot be trusted is driving the decline in turnout. This is much more important than specific beefs over the state of the NHS or education. The scope for changing economic policy at this late stage in the electoral cycle is very limited, but the government can do something about the issue of trust. It should rein in the spin- doctors and stop over-hyping achievements, otherwise it runs a real risk of losing the trust of its supporters and with it the next general election.

It went on: \"If she makes money by writing why should not others of lower rank? . . . It will make no difference if she and her publisher agree to so many deletions that her book has become emasculated. It is the principle of not putting pen to paper that matters.\" It added: \"All members of the country's security forces should keep silent about their work, for life. When there is a requirement to publish, it is the government alone who should do so.\" The bitter rant, which appeared in the letter columns of the Times, was not a missive from some retired blimp residing in a home counties vicarage. It was written by David Lyon, colonel commandant of the SAS. The extraordinary public spectacle of of such an attack by a serving soldier on the former head of the Security Service, a woman once widely respected by the Whitehall establishment, reflects the ferocity of the dispute provoked by Dame Stella's initiative. It is a key issue on the increasingly crowded agenda of a sinister committee of officials from the darker corners of Whitehall which meets at the Cabinet Office. The official title of the committee is an official secret, appropriately perhaps, given that its task is to suppress information. It is an offshoot of the joint intelligence committee chaired by a diplomat, Michael Pakenham, son of Lord Longford. P arties to this spectacular Whitehall dispute include David Omand, permanent secretary at the Home Office, said to be on the side of the doves. Stephen Lander, Dame Stella's successor at MI5, is said to have calmed down after initially expressing alarm. In the hawks' camp, along with the SAS and the ministry of defence, is MI6, headed by Richard Dearlove. MI6, even more protective than MI5 about its secrets, is being blamed in Whitehall for leaking Rimington's intentions to the Sun. MI6, it is said, wanted to get its own back on its \"sister service\" and its former head, who in her time dominated Whitehall committees in her pursuit of an ever-expanding role for MI5. A key figure in the row is Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary, who says he has Tony Blair's ear. The prime minister, he tells the Pakenham committee, takes an ex tremely hard line on the need to prosecute all renegade spooks and silence any journalist who writes about them. Other ministers have no say in all this. They do not attend meetings of Pakenham's committee. Foreign secretary Robin Cook - to whom MI6 is nominally responsible - and Peter Hain, his minister of state, say they are horrified by the way the secret police are threatening to send journalists to jail. Apparently they can do nothing about it. Meanwhile, a battery of government lawyers waits in the wings, ready to fire off their next injunction, or court order demanding newspapers (including the Guardian, the Observer, and the Sunday Times) hand over material to help Whitehall in its battles against renegade spooks. Across the road from the Cabinet Office, a secret MoD cell has obtained no fewer than nine injunctions preventing former members of the special forces from blowing the whistle. Among them is \"Martin Ingram\", the pseudonym of a former undercover intelligence officer in Northern Ireland. Police in pursuit of him recently burgled a house and his manuscript was stolen. Liam Clarke, the Sunday Times Northern Ireland editor has been summoned to the MoD and advised to bring a lawyer with him. Fortunately neither this MoD cell nor Lyon succeeded in preventing soldiers from making startling revelations to Peter Taylor, presenter of the BBC trilogy, Brits, which ended this week. Last week Nigel Wylde, a former army officer awarded the Queen's gallantry medal for his working defusing bombs, was committed for trial at the Old Bailey. His alleged crime? Disclosing information about how army computers secretly monitor the activities of two thirds of the population in Northern Ireland. Army sources concede he has done no damage to national security. This is not the point at issue, despite Lyon's outburst. It is the right of whistleblowers and the media in a so-called mature democracy to reveal the past activities of our secret services. Instead of relying on unaccountable and self-serving members of a secret committee, ministers should wake up and set up a credible and independent vetting system for former spooks - and repeal the Official Secrets Act. richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/jun/02/culture.reviews2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-02T09:14:45Z","webTitle":"The Ninth Gate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jun/02/culture.reviews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jun/02/culture.reviews2","fields":{"headline":"The Ninth Gate","bodyText":"The Ninth Gate is a supernatural thriller produced and directed by Roman Polanski, starring Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, dealer in antiquarian books - a scholarly, recondite trade which Depp denotes by sporting a goatee, spectacles, and a canvas shoulder bag slung bandolier-style over his Oxfam coat, like a student from the 1980s.

Arnold was an inspector of schools, and a champion of higher education, and he believed in excellence in education as the way not only to staff the economy, important though that is, but to produce an enculturated society which will live up to the ideal in Aristotle's dictum: \"we educate ourselves in order to make noble use of our leisure.\" From China to France every country that is or aspires to be developed has an elite educational stratum, aimed at taking the most gifted students and giving them the best intellectual training possible. In China this is done from an early age, with special schools for the brightest children. In France the system of Hautes Ecoles - superior universities, entry to which is fiercely competitive - cream the highest-flying minds and subject them to a rigorous discipline. The aim in all cases is to enhance the best in order to gain the highest quality in science, engineering, law, national administration, medicine and the arts. Few could object to the rationale behind this, save those for whom universal mediocrity is a price worth paying for social equality. But there is a danger to which meritocratic means to the cultivation of excellence - or what should be solely such - falls prey. It is if, after the establishment of the means, merit by itself ceases to be enough, and money and influence become additional criteria. In many, perhaps most, countries in the world money and influence are the determiners of social advancement, even where meritocratic criteria still apply too: in America you need money to gain social advantages, in China it helps to be a party member. Until recently the United Kingdom was one of the few countries where educational excellence was available on grounds purely of merit, despite the fact that the superior education provided by private schools ensured that plutocratic influences interfered with meritocratic ones, in this case by purchasing meritocratic advantages. This remains the case, although to a much reduced extent than formerly. But recent changes mean that the money barrier has been reintroduced: university students now have to pay fees, and will soon be paying more. They do so either by borrowing or by relying on parents. Starting life in debt or expense, even for supposed greater rewards later, is a disincentive, and is felt especially by the already least advantaged. It is therefore an irony that a government which is reintroducing a money obstacle, and with it a serious derogation from merit as the sole criterion, should focus on influence, under the disguise of the \"old school tie\" - a much diminished and ever-diminishing factor - as a political ploy. If it were not a cheap opinion-poll trick, it would be troubling evidence of ignorance or unintelligence. It is easy for popular newspapers and populist politicians to make pejorative use of the term \"elite,\" but they are just as quick to complain if doctors, teachers, or sportsmen playing for national sides, fail our highest expectations - if, in short, they are not elite after all. Although there are few if any true democracies in the world - most dispensations claiming that name are elective oligarchies - the democratic spirit nevertheless invests western life, both for good and ill. The good resides in the pressure to treat everyone fairly, the ill resides in the pressure to make everyone alike. This latter is a levelling tendency, a downward thrust, which dislikes excellence because it raises mountains where the negative-democratic spirit wishes to see only plains. But democracy should not aim to reduce people and their achievements to a common denominator; it should aim to raise them, ambitiously and dramatically, as close as possible to an ideal. Excellence in every sphere should be held out as the target, fostered and encouraged wherever found by an effort of the social will: which means, among other things, by having institutions, especially of learning, which are the finest and most demanding of their kind. A society which resents excellence is a society in trouble. What good does it do us if we hold back the best to make the rest feel better? We would not dream of doing so in football, and we would be alarmed if we thought we did it in medicine. There is a crucial point here. It is that doing and being the best takes real effort. America's Camelot president, John F. Kennedy, was blessed in his speech-writers, one of whom wrote a memorable peroration on why America wished to put a man on the moon (the real reason was to show that America had a bigger rocket than the Soviets): we will do it, said the text of the speech, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; and doing hard things makes you better. That is what excellence is for: it is for striving towards the highest standards, and moving mankind forward thereby."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2000/jun/03/uk.politicalnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-03T00:44:30Z","webTitle":"EU allies seek to halt rights charter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jun/03/uk.politicalnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jun/03/uk.politicalnews1","fields":{"headline":"EU allies seek to halt rights charter","bodyText":"Britain is building alliances with at least four other EU member states to block a legally binding charter of fundamental rights that would be written into a new treaty at the end of the year. With the Tories on the attack over alleged government acquiescence in an embryonic \"constitution\" for the EU, it emerged yesterday that there is wide opposition to the maximalist version of the project. Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Spain all share Britain's determination to resist calls for a charter that includes new social and economic rights, diplomats said. Several other small countries have reservations, too. Lord Goldsmith, Tony Blair's representative on the committee drafting the document, insisted in a BBC interview that the government would \"get anything removed that goes beyond existing rights as recognised in the United Kingdom.\" Britain's main worry is that France, taking over the EU's rotating presidency on July 1, will push for a charter with new social rights, guaranteeing maximum working hours, worker consultation and trade union membership. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, wants a legally binding document, but is said to be much less keen on the social dimension. Italy, Greece and possibly federalist-minded Belgium are the keenest supporters of the charter and want it incorporated into a proposed treaty of Nice in December. The European commission also backs a strong and legally binding charter. But it has no say in the actual decision to draw up a new treaty. The government had originally hoped to get away with nothing more than a pledge card listing existing rights in an accessible way. Apart from the Conservatives, the CBI opposes the charter on the grounds that it would impose new costs on British industry. The TUC sees it as a possible means of strengthening employment relations law. Mr Blair is confident that he can find enough allies to make opposition comfortable. But the timing is bad because it coincides with important talks on EU institutional reform and the still unresolved issue of the withholding tax on cross-border savings. Eurosceptics are also seizing on strong Franco-German determination to step up the role of the 11 EU member states that have already adopted the single currency, in a way that would underline Britain's exclusion. Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday returned to the attack on the government. He told BBC radio's Today programme: \"There are two irreconcilable views on this. The government is doing its usual thing of saying, 'Don't worry, chaps, it's perfectly harmless, just a bit of window-dressing, nothing to worry about.' \"And yet you've got people on the continent who say this is the beginning of a written constitution for the European Union, that it is a fundamental building for the single European superstate.

Mr Prescott's relatively mild remarks, after seven days of high octane attacks on elitism, brought an angry reaction from leading academics in the north, who accused him of being ignorant and badly briefed. The government regards Mr Prescott as an excellent advocate of opportunity for all in education, since he himself failed his 11 plus but was subsequently given a place at Ruskin College in Oxford, from which he then prospered. The row had been fuelled over a week ago when Gordon Brown attacked Magdalen College, Oxford, for its \"scandalous\" rejection of the state school pupil Laura Spence, despite her excellent academic record. In a speech on Tyneside, Mr Prescott said: \"We believe many universities north and south could do more to attract people of ability regardless of their backgrounds.\" He also said he felt \"sensitive\" about the fact that regional universities did not take enough students from their own areas. Discussing his own education, he said: \"I felt lucky because there were many people who I felt had equal ability but just didn't get the chance to develop it. \"It is not only immoral to write people off like that, it doesn't even make economic sense because, in a world of change, learning and adapting are the key to success for individuals and the whole country - and we still haven't gone far enough. \"So where there are barriers to learning and opportunity, our job is to take them down for all people.\" Later he added: \"Whether we are talking about universities in the north or the south, it is for all of us to ensure a better spread of standards.\" But he added that some universities in the north were doing a great deal to improve standards. Labour party and government sources stressed that his comments were not intended as an attack on any individual university. Despite the emollient words, there was protest by Durham University's vice-chancellor, Sir Kenneth Calman. He said: \"It is clear from some of the things being said by ministers that they have not been well briefed about the efforts that universities such as Durham have been making for a number of years.\" James Wright, the vice-chancellor of Newcastle University, said ministers who were critical of admissions policies were \"not really aware of the facts\". He pointed out that his university had offered a place to study medicine to Laura Spence, but that she had turned it down. \"I am unhappy with the way [ministers] are addressing the situation. \"We wouldn't be putting in all these efforts ourselves if we didn't think there was a problem to be addressed. I am not sure that they know in detail what efforts we are making,\" he said. \"It looks as if they have been shown up not to be really aware of all of the facts on the issue.\" Diana Warwick, the chief executive of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom, said: \"Veiled comments like today's provide more heat than light about the real tasks in hand: which are to get more disadvantaged pupils into univer sities and to stimulate regional economies.\" Conservatives and Liberal Democrat spokesmen joined the universities in their attack on the government. The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said Mr Prescott was attacking a university a day. The Liberal Democrats' higher education spokesman, Evan Harris, adopted an attack from the left. \"It is breathtakingly hypocritical of senior cabinet ministers like John Prescott, Gordon Brown, David Blunkett and the prime minister - all of whom benefited from grants and free tuition - to refuse to own up to the difficulties caused by their government's abolition of maintenance grants and the imposition of tuition fees,\" he said. The National Union of Students, which is opposed to tuition fees, nevertheless blamed the universities for failing to reform their admissions system in order to make it easier for students from less well-off backgrounds to study at the elite centres of learning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jun/03/unitedkingdom","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-03T17:42:45Z","webTitle":"Angel of the west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jun/03/unitedkingdom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jun/03/unitedkingdom","fields":{"headline":"Angel of the west","bodyText":"If the sculptor Anthony Gormley could be transported instantly into the countryside, the place he'd probably choose would be Hatterrall Ridge, a long spine of high ground that offers huge views and marks the ancient boundary between England and Wales. \"It's real moorland,\" he says. \"You look down into Herefordshire to the east and you can imagine yourself as a Celt staring down on the lush pastures, working out which herd of cattle you're going to raid. It's very marked - the contrast between this wild, changeless moorland and the cultivated country.\" The ridge forms part of Offa's Dyke path after it emerges from the woodlands of the Wye Valley and crosses the farmland near Monmouth. \"What's nice about Offa's Dyke is that it's a defined route,\" he says. \"It's good for children because it's not easily lost, and it puts this ancient imprint on the landscape, which is wonderful - you're always looking for the ditch and the dyke and you see it in all sorts of ways. \"Sometimes it's on the skyline, sometimes it's lost in the woods, and sometimes it's not there at all, which makes it a bit like a treasure trail. I like that sort of intrigue, and the dyke gives the walk a very strong sense of history.\" Gormley, famous for open-air works including the Angel of the North in Gateshead, the Iron Man in Birmingham city centre, and Quantum Cloud at the Dome, has been on several long-distance walks including two in the Himalayas. Usually he goes with other people. \"Walking for me is the best way of getting to know someone else and of getting to know yourself: you think about your life and it gives you a kind of perspective. But I don't think that's what I do it for - it's more for that lovely feeling when you get off the train or leave your car and you know that for days you've left it all behind. \"There's a fantastic sense of freedom and getting back into an elemental world where there's just you and the sky and the earth and the birds and the sheep, and you find a different place for yourself. I find that really healing - the body escapes, and the mind escapes as well, and with the rhythm of walking you can somehow think better - more progressively.\" What was Offa's Dyke for? It's virtually certain that the dyke was built by the king whose name it carries. Offa ruled the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia and was keen to define his territory. Asser, writing King Alfred's biography in Wessex a century later, records that he built it \"from sea to sea\" - about 170 miles. The purpose of the huge earthwork, in places 25ft high, is less definite. It may have been a military barrier, but there are no signs of forts or roads. According to archaeologist Cyril Fox, it was primarily a boundary agreed between hostile kingdoms. There are no original records to settle the matter because Mercia was almost completely destroyed by the Vikings in the 9th century. \"It was a powerful message to Offa's enemies, and to other kings including Charlemagne, who was building up his empire in France at that time,\" says Ian Bapty, Offa's Dyke archaeological management officer. \"Whatever the original reason, it has had an enormous influence on patterns of settlement and cultural identity, a line in the landscape behind which people have thought of themselves as Welsh rather than English. \"It's the only place in Europe where an earthwork gives you such a strong sense of cultural geography.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2000/jun/03/euro2000.sport","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-03T21:44:40Z","webTitle":"Germany's bond is back but Bierhoff remains on the rocks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jun/03/euro2000.sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jun/03/euro2000.sport","fields":{"headline":"Germany's bond is back but Bierhoff remains on the rocks","bodyText":"Somewhere in Europe there's a multi-million-pound striker and national team captain struggling to justify his automatic selection for Euro 2000. Sound familiar? Thought so. Only for Alan Shearer of a few months back read Oliver Bierhoff this morning. Once the source of hope for Germany's future, Bierhoff is now seen by many as a figure who belongs in the past. His last goal for his country came 610 minutes ago against Northern Ireland last September. A poll released on Thursday on the German website Sport1.de showed that the Milan player is regarded by the public as the weakest of the five strikers in Germany's squad. The national coach Erich Ribbeck seems to disagree, though Bierhoff still has good reason to hope history repeats itself when he plays against the Czech Republic tonight. At Wembley four years ago he scored twice against the Czechs to win Euro 96. This evening's match in Nuremberg may only be a friendly but Bierhoff can sense the importance. \"I need a goal,\" he said, \"no matter what it looks like.\" Bierhoff scored 11 times in Serie A last season and was subjected to fierce criticism at times. Such attacks have been commonplace throughout his career, continuing even as his 20 goals led Milan to the 1999 scudetto . His admirers in Germany point out that the service he receives in the national side has been far from ideal. Germany's recent form has certainly been uninspired but there was an optimistic feel at their training camp in Mallorca last week. Real Mallorca were beaten 4-0 in a warm-up match and the internal squabbling seemed to be gone. \"The players have got clear heads again,\" said Ribbeck, who has ignored calls for his resignation. The Bayern Munich midfielder Mehmet Scholl confirmed the change in mood as preparations for the games against Portugal, Romania and England continued. \"I'm much more optimistic for the European Championship than I was before the training camp,\" he said. \"The atmosphere is even nearly better than before Euro 96. We had our doubts then, too.\" The Czech Republic, who won all 10 of their qualifying games, should offer a good guide to Germany's health. The Czechs learned yesterday that Holland, their opening opponents at Euro 2000, expect Edgar Davids to have recovered from an operation on an ingrowing toenail in time for their June 11 encounter. Roger Moore, a man who as James Bond became used to dealing with more serious problems than ingrowing toenails, is expected to be among a packed crowd in Ljubljana today for Slovenia's final warm-up match against Saudi Arabia. The Slovenian FA has agreed to donate a percentage of the gate receipts to the Slovenian National Committee for Unicef and Moore will be there in his capacity as a Unicef ambassador. The game is Slovenia's first since the end of April, when they lost 3-2 in France after going 2-0 ahead. Spain face a tough test in Sweden today. Their confident-sounding coach Jose Antonio Camacho has also organised a friendly in Luxembourg on Wednesday and asked his squad to relax ahead of the main event. \"It is important for the players now to show the same enjoyment that they have in training this past week,\" he said. \"They've done very well here and I'm not worried about anything.\" Norway, Spain's opening opponents in Rotterdam on June 13, take on Italy this afternoon hoping for a psychological boost. \"If we perform well the players will gain confidence,\" said their coach Nils Johan Semb. \"That is important to bring to the first game.\" More than £100m is expected to be staked on Euro 2000 with the United Kingdom betting industry, beating by about £20m the amount placed during France 98."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2000/jun/04/fiction.features","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-03T23:46:56Z","webTitle":"Back to where I once belonged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/04/fiction.features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jun/04/fiction.features","fields":{"headline":"Back to where I once belonged","bodyText":"'Yearning', she says. 'As a child I was always full of yearning.' For a home, stability, a settled sense of love; for children of her own (from the age of three, she used to dream up names for the son and daughter she wanted: Lancelot and Eloise were favoured). Now, in her mid-thirties, Esther Freud has found all these things - though the son and daughter are called Albie and Anna. Yet, still the novels that she writes are full of that sense of longing. I can think of no other writer who is so haunted by childhood, and who so authentically and unpatronisingly shows what it is like to be young, helpless, eager, vulnerable, resilient, awash with inarticulate needs. Esther Freud, who was in her twenties when her first novel, the autobiographical Hideous Kinky, was published, has had from the very beginning her own charismatic voice: candid, lucid, unflashy, with a freshness and a sweetness about it. Much like her own voice when you meet her, light-timbred, fluent. Or her face - small, mobile, interested, with huge murk-green eyes. Which is only one side of the story, of course, for the sunshine and sanity she presents is the pleasant surface that lies over darker things. This is only to be expected from her background. Her father is the disturbing painter Lucian Freud. Her great-grandfather is Sigmund. Her sister is Bella Freud the designer; her cousins include Emma and Matthew Freud; her uncle is Clement. She remembers picking up a copy of Time Out once, intrigued by the cover line, '100 Things We Love to Hate', only to find that one of them was 'anyone called Freud'. She has numerous half-siblings, some discovered only recently. She led a peripatetic girlhood, dragged off to Morocco after her hippy mother, wearing a red silk kaftan and longing for an acrylic jumper, breathing in exotic spices and dreaming of cornflakes. Family history breathes down her neck. Her name tags her. Her childhood dogs her. She grew up feeling that her life was extraordinary, while she herself was quite ordinary. This tension - between excitement and security; safety and adventure - tightens all of her fiction. Her latest book, The Wild, is about step-families. 'I have always known I would write about extended families,' she says, sitting in a café near Hampstead Heath, drinking tea and apple juice. Single father William - teacher by day, and in his spare time handyman, woodcutter, cook, singer and dancer, organiser of domestic adventures, insister upon cheerfulness - has three daughters. Single mother Francine, with her children Tess and Jake, rents rooms from him. We know at once that this is not a story of happy families, for the opening pages describe a violent scene towards which the rest of the novel then works its way, and which fills its pages with dread. Scenes that are ostensibly cheerful fall into the shadows. A starting point for The Wild was, says Esther Freud, a sentence: 'We are living in a really brilliant house' - very spooky when the reader knows from the beginning that the house is also a house of domestic horror. Another starting point was the character of Tess, nine years old, needy, clumsy, diligent, hopeful, imaginative, plain. She wets her bed, night after night: her shameful secret. She writes bright letters to her absent father. She adores William, spaniel-like. 'He fills up her entire vision,' says Esther Freud, 'while William, he has all sorts of things in his life, and right out of the corner of his eye, every so often, he'll glimpse her small figure.' She loves him with a passion; he scarcely notices her, and when he does it is with irritation. William, who provides the other main narrative point of view, is a sinister version of the New Man, except his creator has some sympathy for him: 'There's a certain kind of man I hate - the one who makes himself king of a very small kingdom. I know William's a monster. But I didn't want to write a didactic book. And I also know what it's like to be alone in a house full of children. Everyone howling. You can't escape. He wants to be this perfect father.' Instead he becomes like the leader of a cult where everyone has to smile and be happy. Esther Freud is candid about using the events of her own life and the life of her extended family in her novels - Hideous Kinky was followed by Peerless Flats and Gaglow. 'I am amazed how ruthless I am,' she says. 'I don't think of myself like that. But if it works, I feel compelled by it. I tell myself I'll worry later. People go \"God! I would have waited until everyone concerned was dead\". But I can't wait.' As a child, she was always telling stories (just like Tess does in The Wild), and she says that she has always 'hoarded' her past, anxious that she would forget it before she wrote it down and turned it into a narrative, her fictional version. 'My secrets and fears were so huge,' she says. She plucks a memory from her store for me, one that has stayed with her. 'I was seven, maybe eight, and was on my way to Scotland to see a friend and on the way we stopped off to visit my father. He gave me a chocolate shoe, it was full of chocolates. I was SO delighted. I arrived in Scotland and unwrapped it and I suddenly remembered that I don't like chocolate. I kept it for years and years and couldn't eat it and couldn't throw it away and couldn't forget how much it hurt.' She gives a little chuckle at the self she was - and yet this chocolate shoe (which in The Wild becomes a chocolate pig that her absent father gives Tess) could stand as a kind of emblem of the way Esther Freud treats her past: never throwing it away, hoarding it, compelled by it. Tess is a bed-wetter. Esther Freud used to wet the bed herself. She remembers it as 'a secret you hold on to and it takes over. It becomes this huge thing. There's the fear of being judged, being found out. I thought I was the only person in the world who wet my bed.' It's those things that stung and haunted her which then turn up in her novels. 'Writing freed me from the past,' she says. 'I think I used to live in the past, and in the future. I was strangely unconnected to the present. It showed in the way I was always locking myself out of the house, say, or I'd suddenly find I was on the underground on my way to Cockfosters, not the other line. In a way, when I wrote Hideous Kinky , I stopped having to think so much about the past. I had always worried that if I forgot it, then no one would know what had happened to us. I felt my past was what was interesting about me. I was invisible, really, and only my past made me special and glamorous. I would look in the mirror and see a normal-looking girl. My background didn't show in my face. I wanted to be different, at the same time that I so wanted to be the same as everyone else. I always felt I was watched as a child, and I was watching ourselves as well. I was making everything into a story as it happened.' At the same time she felt herself freed from the past by writing it, she stopped worrying so much about her future by moving into it; taking possession of the life she wanted. 'I stopped acting (a profession which maybe always makes you feel a sense of yearning to be at the centre), and I wrote Hideous Kinky at about the same time as I met the right man,' she says. The right man is the fine actor David Morrissey. 'Now I'm in the family that I dreamed of all my life. I always, always wanted children and I was always scared I wouldn't have them. You know when you drop a coin in a fountain and make a wish? I would always wish for children. In fact, when I went to Legoland the other day and people were dropping coins in the fountain, I realised I didn't really have anything urgent to wish for any more. I'd like more children, but it wouldn't break my heart if I didn't, not like it would have broken my heart to not have any.' So in a way, Esther Freud feels she has arrived at the place she has been longing for all her upturned life. 'Being married, having children, it hasn't changed me that much. It's more, \"Oh yes, this is what I should be doing\". I don't feel, my God, what has happened to my life, the way some women do when they have children. I don't feel as if I've lost my freedom - I didn't feel that free before. I didn't feel a young, free, this-is-my-life person. I was too busy waiting for the right man, the children. I was longing too much for my future. Now that I've got it, I feel more liberated. I feel more special to myself now. In a way, I feel younger than I did when I was young.' She adds quite simply: 'I'm just so happy.' (In fact, she was so very, very happy after the birth of Albie, that after five days she asked the midwife if she was still on drugs.) Journalists who interview Esther Freud tend to call her 'composed'. More than once, people have compared her to a cat - and there is something enigmatic and graceful about her. She blinks and grins at this. 'I am very happy for people to think that. I've spent a long time practising.' She is, she says, a very private person - while plundering her private life for her stories. Confession only happens on the page. 'I never wanted people to know if I had a problem,' she says. 'Like my bed-wetting, all my secrets. I used to be amazed by girls at school who'd chat away about having abortions or whatever. Sometimes I would try to imitate that openness, but I just couldn't. Maybe I was worried, somehow, that if I told my secrets and fears they would become real - I would see in people's faces that I wasn't all right. But if no one knew, it may not be real.' As if things aren't real until they are turned into words, stories. She remembers being at some strange party for the launch of a pen. There was a handwriting expert there, and she and some friends queued up to have their writing analysed. 'My heart was thumping so. I asked my friends, \"Are you scared?\" and they just looked at me. \"Why on earth should we be scared?\" But I was scared. I didn't know what he would find out about me. I don't know if I was worried he would find something out I did know and was ashamed of, or something I didn't even know myself. He looked at my writing and said, \"You don't like people to know about you, do you?\" \"No!\" I squeaked. \"No!\" I suppose I fear I will be discovered as a fraud. Maybe acting made me feel that - but I'm sure it comes from my childhood. All those secrets.' Secrets are what she explores in her novels. She stands up to go, five foot three in her trainers, light-footed and slight. A girl with green eyes, a woman with her own voice. • To order The Wild for £11.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2000/jun/04/labour.labour1997to99","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-03T23:58:45Z","webTitle":"C'mon, Tony, where's the Big Idea?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jun/04/labour.labour1997to99","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jun/04/labour.labour1997to99","fields":{"headline":"C'mon, Tony, where's the Big Idea?","bodyText":"Tony Blair has spent most of the six years since his election as Labour leader trying to lower expectations: no great transfer of wealth from rich to poor, no sudden splurge of spending on education or health, no new dawn for public ownership, no gleaming new trains or Tube lines. The main themes were 'modernisation' and 'constitutional reform', and nobody ever stormed a Winter Palace under slogans like that. Nor did anyone compose a song to the effect that the people's flag was deeply prudent. Yet in the past year, Mr Blair has made such extravagant promises that one sometimes wonders if he has taken leave of his senses. More, one doubts his grasp of either arithmetic or economics. At the Labour Party conference last autumn, we had the promise to abolish child poverty in a generation. Then on David Frost's sofa one Sunday in January, in the midst of a flu crisis (which figures now reveal to have been a real one, though people accused Ministers of talking it up in order to disguise inadequacies in the NHS), we had the promise to bring the proportion of GDP spent on health up to the European average. Now the Guardian reports 'an audacious strategy' to abolish NHS waiting lists. Each promise, in its way, is preposterous. Poverty is usually defined as living on less than half the national average income; the quickest way to reduce poverty, therefore, is to soak the rich with taxation at levels that one would expect Mr Blair to judge politically unacceptable. Bringing health spending up to the European average requires a rise of at least one-third from present levels (I say 'at least' since there is nothing to stop other European countries increasing their spending, as they have done consistently for the last 20 years, thus raising the standard Mr Blair has to reach). Abolishing waiting lists requires the repeal of a fundamental law of economics: that scarce resources must be rationed in some way and if they are not rationed by price or by some other means (such as a judgment that some cases are more deserving than others) they must be rationed by queuing. This is not to say that queuing is necessarily a bad thing - since almost anyone can take their place in a queue, it is probably the most democratic and egalitarian means of distributing resources - merely to observe that, where services are offered free, it is almost an inevitability. So Mr Blair's promises remind me of the agendas for journalists' union conferences that I attended some 20 years ago. These were packed with motions requiring the union leadership to bring an 'immediate' end to the British 'occupation' of Northern Ireland, to 'oppose' American 'imperialism', and such like. The leadership would usually rule these out of order on the grounds that they were 'incapable of implementation'. Mr Blair's big ideas are likewise incapable of implementation. Is that a bad thing? Not at all. Any political or religious movement needs a compass, something to give it bearings, benchmarks against which it can judge its mundane, day-to-day choices. Christians have been striving for the Kingdom of Heaven for 2,000 years; it is not expected to arrive, as the Americans would put it, any time soon. Labour used to have its Clause 4; but nobody seriously thought that the workers by hand or by brain would ever control significant sectors of industry. Margaret Thatcher aimed to roll back the state and to reduce the burden of taxation. She came nowhere near either aim (if anything, she was further away from her goals when she left office than when she entered it) but at least the country understood her intentions and, for that reason, she changed, for better or worse, the national culture. The weakness of Mr Blair's mysterious Third Way has always been its lack of such sense of direction; we can see the roads he doesn't want to travel far more clearly than the one he does. Long before Labour came to power, I remember discussing with a senior New Labour adviser how a left-wing government could give civil servants a simple guiding light, something that would concentrate their thoughts and channel their mental energies. Thatcher's governments, the adviser observed, were guided by a very simple question: 'How can we create a market?' That dominated everything Whitehall did; Ministers and civil servants knew, when they started to frame policy, that anything that failed to address that question was doomed. What would be the equivalent for Labour? Something like 'how can we increase equality of opportunity?' we thought - though, somehow, that didn't seem precise enough or bold enough? But over the past three years, I fear, the question has been nothing more than 'how can we avoid offending middle England?' or 'how can we get a good headline in the Sun or the Daily Mail ?' Just as no Tory policy got beyond the starting blocks without passing the market test, so no New Labour policy gets anywhere without passing the David Yelland/Paul Dacre test. The Thatcher formula led, to be sure, to absurdities, notably the internal market in the NHS and, long after Thatcher herself had left office, the botched privatisation of the railways. Mr Blair's initial popularity was based, in part, on his resistance to politics driven by ideology. But I do not think that, in the end, politics can flourish unless the voters are offered some clarity of goals. It is said that people become cynical when politicians make impossible promises and then fail to achieve them. I think they become more cynical when the promises are circumscribed and technical. Was it, for example, so clever of New Labour to promise that the under-sevens in state schools would be taught in classes of fewer than 30, knowing, first, that class sizes in the private sector are enormously lower and, second, that to achieve this aim within available resources, older pupils would have to be taught in even larger classes? To reduce politics to questions of management (Blair's 'what works?') is to reduce it to little more than the kind of choice we make between gas appliances or video recorders or a new pair of shoes. It tells people that politics can make only a marginal difference to their lives, that it doesn't really deal in big ideas at all. That is essentially the message from the Clinton presidency (where the Third Way trail was blazed), with the result that less than half the eligible population voted in 1996. And despite the attempts to jazz up politics in Britain - directly-elected mayors, polling stations open for several days, more postal voting - the same message is emerging here, with the turnout only 33.6 per cent in the London mayoral elections, supposedly the most exciting contest for years. That is bound to worry a Labour Government because low turnouts invariably favour governments of the Right. But all politicians should be worried, not that they are failing to sell their own particular parties, but that they are failing to sell democratic politics as a source of idealism and inspiration. I hope that the Nineties - in which just about the most memorable political idea, because of its sheer banality, was John Major's cones hotline - will turn out to have been an aberration. I hope that politicians can once more engage our deepest feelings and deepest prejudices, bringing angry voices to the radio phone-ins and the newspaper letters columns, as the Oxbridge entry issue has done over the past two weeks. I hope that Tony Blair continues to make reckless promises and that Gordon Brown continues to wage class war. We've had campaigns for real ale, real cheese, real education; let's now have a campaign for real politics.

According to the World Health Organisation, the US ranks a sickly 24th in a global table of healthy life expectancy. Compared with most other advanced countries, you die earlier and are more prone to disability in the land of the free. The UK is placed an unremarkable 14th in the table, the first such rankings produced by the WHO, although that falls a long way short of the picture of life in Japan - the healthiest country on earth by some margin. At the other end of the scale, the rankings reflect graphically the ravages of Aids in much of Africa. All 10 lowest rated countries are in sub-Saharan Africa and healthy life expectancy in strife-torn Sierra Leone, at the foot of the table, is put at less than 26 years. Alan Lopez, co-ordinator of the WHO's epidemiology and burden of disease team, said: \"Healthy life expectancy in some African countries is dropping to levels we haven't seen in advanced countries since medieval times.\" Previous exercises of this kind have been based purely on death rates. These new rankings, published last night, aim to assess the number of years lived at \"full health\", with periods of illness weighted by severity and subtracted from overall life expectancy. On average, people in the healthiest regions lose some 9% of their lives to disability; in the worst-off countries, where disease often strikes young, people lose 14%. For the UK, babies born in 1999 can expect 71.7 years of healthy life. But there is a marked difference between females (73.7) and males (69.7). This gender gap is even more pronounced in France, which is placed third most healthy nation largely because of the striking healthy life expectancy of females (76.9) rather than that of males (69.3). The WHO attributes this to the fact that French women have not been heavy smokers. But it says a recent upsurge in smoking among young women will inevitably cause a rise in tobacco-related disease and knock France down the table. The US's bleak showing is linked partly to smoking and to high rates of heart disease and Aids, but also to violence and the plight of groups such as native Americans, rural blacks and the inner-city poor, whose health is said to be \"more characteristic of a poor developing country than a rich industrialised one\". Average American healthy life expectancy is put at 70.0, below Israel and just above Cyprus and Dominica (both 69.8) and Ireland (69.6). Christopher Murray, director of WHO's global programme on evidence for health policy, said: \"The position of the US is one of the surprises of the new rating system. \"Basically, you die earlier and spend more time disabled if you're an American rather than a member of most other advanced countries.\" Post-unification Germany is ranked 22nd in the table, while Denmark comes 28th and New Zealand 31st - in contrast to Australia's second place on 73.2 years. The latter's performance is attributed to steep falls in smoking. The pre-eminence of Japan (74.5) is put down to traditionally low tobacco use and a low-fat diet, though both of these factors are changing. In sub-Saharan Africa, Aids is now the leading cause of death and is considered to have cut life expectancy in some countries by as much as 20 years.

The two men, suspected of travelling with the intent of causing trouble, are believed to be the subject of domestic banning orders preventing them from attending football matches in England. One of the men was turned back after landing at Schipol airport in Amsterdam and the other was intercepted at the Hook of Holland ferry port. The action by Dutch border authorities was welcomed by Jack Straw, the home secretary, as the first success of a joint intelligence effort by British, Dutch, Belgian and French police designed to avoid outbreaks of violent disorder at the three-week tournament. The two men are among more than 1,000 known or suspected hooligans whose names have been passed to Dutch, Belgian and French authorities by the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). The 1998 World Cup in France was marred by riots involving English fans in Marseille and Lens, and recent violence involving supporters of Arsenal and Leeds and the Turkish club Galatasaray has heightened tension. Anticipating familiar scenes, particularly at England's match with Germany in Charleroi a week on Saturday, the Home Office and the NCIS have been keen to demonstrate this week that they have done everything within their power to prevent hooligans reaching Euro 2000. Yesterday, however, Mr Straw was criticised by the chief executive of the European football association (Uefa), Gerhard Aigner, for failing to pass legislation allowing the courts to remove the passports of known hooligans. Confirming that the England-Germany match will go ahead in Charleroi despite misgivings about safety inside the 30,000-capacity stadium and crowd control around it, Mr Aigner said: \"It is regrettable that the government in the United Kingdom has not introduced legislation which would make it possible to stop registered hooligans from travelling.\" This week Mr Straw blamed \"maverick Tories and a pusillanimous Conservative front bench\" for blocking the legislation when it was introduced last year. It was not reintroduced prior to Euro 2000 because the legislative time was not available, he said. Mr Aigner defended the decision to stage the England-Germany game in Charleroi, claiming its suitability as a venue was not questioned until it was too late. \"Over the last three years, both Uefa and the organisers, together with the authorities in both host countries, have carefully prepared the event,\" he said. \"At no time did the authorities make any reservations with regard to the use of the stadiums, including the one in Charleroi, for the matches to be played there.\" Reacting to Mr Aigner's criticism, Mr Straw said the NCIS had launched the most extensive and sophisticated operation ever for a big overseas tournament. Officers from 19 regional police forces have been seconded to the football unit and will work closely with spotters on the ground in Belgium and Holland to monitor the movement of English hooligans. The unit has identified 99 people against whom there are international banning orders, 416 subject to domestic banning orders and hundreds with no football-related convictions but suspected of being involved in related violence. All those subject to domestic orders have been sent a letter from the NCIS informing them that if they travel to the low countries there is every chance they will be turned back. Those subject to international orders will have to surrender their passports or report on a daily basis at a police station from today. Bryan Drew, head of the NCIS, emphasised that Dutch and Belgian police were determined to arrest, charge and convict those involved in violence. He said that on returning to England those hooligans convicted would be arrested again and banned from football grounds for at least 10 years. International banning orders can only be imposed on hooligans if they have been convicted in a foreign court. There was dismay within the NCIS and the Home Office last month when hooligans in violent clashes between Arsenal and Galatasary supporters before the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen were deported without charge by Danish authorities. The Belgian justice ministry yesterday announced that 150 prisoners are to be released for the duration of the tournament to make room for hooligans in the country's overcrowded prisons. Though the scheme is voluntary, sex offenders, lifers and convicts in the process of being charged for other offences were not allowed to apply. Further space is to be created by delaying the sentencing of non-dangerous criminals until after the tournament. Belgium's prisons can hold a maximum of 8,500 people and are already full. Police garages in Charleroi have already been converted into makeshift cells. \"Anyone who is arrested under the fast-track procedure can be detained for five days before appearing in front of a judge. Granting prison leave will allow us to keep suspects locked up effectively,\" a spokeswoman said. The Dutch authorities are also willing to release inmates coming to the end of their sentences for the same reasons.

In fact national perspectives rule OK, especially when it comes to soldiers and the foreign policies they serve. Defence and security show most clearly how fragile European aspirations can be. Despite the trappings - Javier Solana's appointment as high representative, the promise at last year's Helsinki summit to create a European intervention force - a common \"identity\" is painfully slow in being born. The other day George W Bush's shadow national security adviser anticipated Robertson's speech to Nato defence ministers. Spending by European countries on defence had to rise, she said - Europe had to become more autonomous in security matters. (Neither spelled out \"or else\".) Backsliders will be driven - says Solana, Nato general secretary - by peer review: you show me yours and I will show you mine. \"Member states would discuss collectively their contributions to the headline goal and debate how to make up any shortfalls.\" That implies the existence of a common will not just to defend Europe (which Nato membership affirms) but to project force elsewhere. Some countries believe it - the Dutch say arresting the decline in their defence spending shows their Europeanness. Elsewhere the European security picture cuts little ice with voters and politicians. EU members signed up in Helsinki to a corps capable of speedy movement and intervention. By 2003 a force 180,000-strong, allowing 60,000 warriors to be mobilised at any one time, could deploy within 60 days; any given operation would be sustainable for at least a year. Rapid reaction units already exist in France, the UK and Germany. The problems surround the transformation of their defence posture to allow the Helsinki commitment to be met alongside Nato and other obligations. The big European players have the men, as the chart shows. The problem is their quality, how they are armed, moved and supplied. The German Social Democrat - Green coalition pledged to cut defence. But defence minister Rudolf Scharping admitted to SPD members of the Bundestag that Germany's armed forces are not capable of serving Nato nor Europe in their present state. His solution is a big cut in manpower (though the Schröder government has just agreed women can take frontline roles), freeing up money for equipment. About 13% of German defence spending goes on weapons, compared with 27.5% in the United Kingdom and 24.4% in the US. German forces are, as a result, badly equipped. They have more soldiers - 60.1% of German defence spending goes on manpower compared with 39.2% in the UK. But many are conscripts who do not fight. (The last British conscript was recruited in 1960 and selective service was abolished in the US in 1973; France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Belgium have recently de cided to end compulsory service.) On June 21 the German cabinet is due to cut the defence budget of DM45.3bn to 43.7bn by 2003. Because anything to do with the Bundeswehr evokes painful comparison with the Wehrmacht, the Schröder coalition took the precaution of appointing a commission headed by former president Richard von Weizsäcker to suggest cuts. Scharping now has its plan, for a cut in strength from 463,000 to 320,000. Military conscription would be kept, but only for 30,000 draftees, selected by lottery. The army's own general- inspector recommends 399,000 and mini-conscription. Tampering with the balance of forces is not just a technical decision. Conscription has been seen as a way of ingratiating the army with the public. What would the ethos of a fully-professional force be? The official answer is carry out alliance tasks, especially in Europe. But the French interior minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement wants the German army to be both big and capable of serving autonomous German policy objectives - final proof that the country is now \"reconciled in depth with its history\". Privately, many Germans agree. Cutting troop numbers ought to provide resources for the transport, communications and weaponry that Germany lacks and which may be supplied by new pan-European procurement schemes to which Tony Blair has now committed the UK. So a European fighting force capable of \"doing a Kosovo\" (ie under the American um brella) may just about be conceivable by the middle of the decade. A \"European army\" with the autonomy that implies is a different matter. Where, for example, would its intelligence come from? Solana has taken some tentative steps towards creating a Brussels version of the Cabinet Office's joint intelligence committee. But sooner or later it becomes a question of whether the Americans will share their material with non-British Europeans outside Nato. Charles Grant's recent pamphlet, Intimate Relations (www.cer.org.uk), wondered if Whitehall could build \"firewalls\" to stop European allies gaining access to American intelligence. The Americans are not going to tolerate genuinely independent intelligence-gathering in Europe: logically that would entail finding out what Washington knows. david.walker@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jun/09/books.booksnews","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-09T01:12:48Z","webTitle":"Apocalyptic fundamentalists set to shove Harry Potter aside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/09/books.booksnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jun/09/books.booksnews","fields":{"headline":"Apocalyptic fundamentalists set to shove Harry Potter aside","bodyText":"Move over Harry Potter. Forget John Grisham. Meet instead the two Christian fundamentalist science fiction novelists who are confidently expected to surge to the top of the US fiction bestsellers lists within days of the official publication of their new book. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are an unlikely pair of blockbuster fiction writers. Mr LaHaye is a soft-spoken 74-year-old Christian evangelical minister from California and Mr Jenkins, 50, is a jobbing professional writer. Yet the pair's latest novel, seventh instalment in the Left Behind series which they first started writing in 1995, topped Amazon.com's bestseller list in April based on advance orders alone, and on Sunday it is expected to move straight to first place in the coveted New York Times fiction bestseller list, an unparalleled achievement for a genre novel of this kind. The new book, The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession, combines science fiction with an apocalyptic fundamentalism of which Americans seemingly cannot get enough. The conservative slant of the two authors is underscored by the fact that the villain of the new book, an incarnation of the Antichrist, turns out to be a former secretary general of the United Nations, an organisation which many American conservatives believe is at the centre of an international conspiracy to overthrow the US constitution and establish a world government which would ban the private ownership of firearms and establish a global single currency. In the new novel, the hero of the series, Rayford Steele, falls under suspicion of assassinating the Antichrist. Another hero is a converted Jew, who has accepted Christ as the messiah. Mr LaHaye is among many conservative fundamentalists who insist that Jews must be converted to Christianity as part of the millenarian process. The Left Behind series has sold 17m copies in the US over the past five years, only about 3m fewer than the total American sales of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series, which have commanded the charts on both sides of the Atlantic for most of the past year. The Indwelling has already sold 1.9m copies and the specialist Christian publishers, Tyndale House, has had to built new warehouses at its printworks in Illinois to cope with demand. The success of the new book is all the more remarkable because many publishers and trade specialists had assumed that the success of the earlier novels in the series had been part of conservative America's mounting excitement over the approach of the millennium, when some enthusiasts believed that the world would end and the kingdom of Christ - US style - would be ushered in. Yet the anticlimax of the start of the new millennium has done nothing to dampen enthusiasm for the series. In interviews, Mr LaHaye appears to be the more driven member of the successful duo, saying that the books' message \"is the greatest message of hope in the world\". Mr Jenkins, by contrast, seems more worldly. \"There are some times when I think I was born for this project,\" he said recently. \"Other times I think I was born to play golf.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jun/09/euro.eu","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-09T02:30:58Z","webTitle":"Britain told: economy is ripe for euro","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/09/euro.eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jun/09/euro.eu","fields":{"headline":"Britain told: economy is ripe for euro","bodyText":"The government's attempt to keep the lid on the debate over joining the euro until after the election was undermined yesterday by an independent report from the world's top economic thinktank which said the British and core European economies were close to converging. In spite of strenuous efforts by the Treasury to delete mention of anything remotely contentious, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's regular healthcheck on the UK economy said that in some respects the UK would soon be more like Euroland than some of the new currency zone's existing members. Treasury officials spent six weeks haggling with the OECD over the report on a line-by-line basis in an attempt to water down the comments on the single currency. With polls showing the public 2-1 against Britain joining monetary union, the government is keen to prevent William Hague from turning the election into a referendum on the pound. However, the report is likely to widen the cabinet rift over the single currency, providing a boost to the group - including the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, the trade secretary Stephen Byers, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson - who want the government to campaign more strongly for monetary union. The Treasury said that the government's policy remained unchanged and that the UK would need to pass the five tests set by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in October 1997, before joining the euro. \"The government will publish as assessment of the progress against the five tests early in the next parliament,\" said a spokesman. But the OECD's message was welcomed by pro-monetary union campaigners who said it destroyed the myth that it was economically unsafe for Britain to join the euro. Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham, said: \"This blows out of the water the economic arguments of the anti-Europeans who allow their ideological hostility to Europe to overshadow hard economic facts. Pamphlets are being produced every week saying Britain is moving further and further away from Europe when the economic reality is that our future depends on deepening economic ties. I am glad that the OECD confirms that view.\" The report complimented the government for its economic reforms, calling the outlook for growth and inflation \"rather enviable\". But it urged ministers to make sure the much-needed extra cash being poured into the health service as part of the new spending review was well spent and said one of the major challenges ahead was what to do about euro membership. The OECD's view is that the UK passes the Maastricht criteria on debt, inflation, interest rates and borrowing levels with flying colours and is well on its way to fulfilling the chancellor's five tests, even though it doubts their objectivity. With the two business cycles coming into line, interest rates getting closer and structural reform in the euro area gathering pace, it said: \"In sum, on several scores, even as an 'out', the United Kingdom is projected to be as close, or even closer, to the economic centre of gravity of the euro area than some of the current 'ins'.\" The gap between UK and Euroland interest rates narrowed further yesterday when the European Central Bank raised borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.25%. UK interest rates are 6%. The OECD added that the pound/euro exchange rate remained a problem, although some City economists say that the recent fall of sterling shows that the markets are beginning to take a more realistic view of the pound's value. The euro rallied to a seven-month high against the pound yesterday, bolstered by the shrinking interest rate gap. Britain in Europe, the pro-European lobby group, welcomed the OECD report, saying it showed \"that those people who say Britain will never be able to join the single currency have got their facts wrong. As the high pound does increasing damage to manufacturing industry and inward investment, it is becoming clear that exclusion from the single currency is not a cost-free option.\" But Janet Bush, director of New Europe, the anti-monetary union thinktank, said: \"The OECD offers a highly selective and glib view of economic convergence between Britain and Euroland, basing its analysis on a handful of economic indicators that may well prove to be ships passing in the night. It offers no evidence of the 'sustainable and durable convergence' that the chancellor of the exchequer has declared essential.\" Condemning the chancellor's five tests as a sham, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo, said: \"The government is already committed in principle to join the euro. They are now waiting for a convenient time to hold a referendum. \"This government is committed to following the politics of expediency not the politics of principle, so when they think they can con the electorate into voting to scrap the pound they will.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jun/09/qanda.julianglover","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-09T13:01:16Z","webTitle":"The European single currency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/09/qanda.julianglover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jun/09/qanda.julianglover","fields":{"headline":"The European single currency","bodyText":"Why is this issue in the news? Because of comments in a report issued this week by the influential Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD says the British economy is becoming more and more like the economy in 'euroland' - made up of the countries which have already joined the euro. It suggests that on many of the most important tests of economic performance, the British and European economies are now running on similar lines. For instance, prices are rising in both Britain and euroland by around two per cent a year. The report suggests that the behaviour of Britain's economy will soon be closer to the European average than that of some countries which have already joined. Is this important? Yes - for two reasons. First, the OECD is an independent organisation. It doesn't have a political interest in persuading Britain either to join the euro or to stay out, so its comments will have a significant impact. Secondly, the greater the similarities between the British economy and the rest of Europe, the easier it should be for Britain to replace the pound with the euro without economic disruption. British opponents of the euro have long argued that membership would be a mistake because the British and European economies run differently - meaning that what might be good for Germany would not be good for Britain. This report makes that case look weaker. The Treasury must be happy? Not exactly. While flattered to be praised by the OECD for Britain's 'rather enviable' economic performance, the Treasury is worried that reports such as this will bring the issue of joining the euro to the top of the political agenda. Ministers would rather leave the question until after the general election. They worry that the Conservatives will be able to turn the election into a contest about euro membership - and every opinion poll shows that at the moment the public do not want to join. In fact the Treasury is so worried about this that it apparently persuaded the OECD to tone down those remarks suggesting that Britain was ready to join the single currency. So what do we have to do to join? The British have to meet two conditions - known as the 'convergence criteria'. The first, the 'Maastricht criteria', were put in place by the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, which led to the single currency. These require that any country wanting to join the euro passes a set of tests on its economic performance, in areas such as debt, inflation, interest rates and borrowing. Britain meets these with flying colours, so according to the rules we could join the euro tomorrow if we wanted to. But in October 1997 the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced five further tests he wants the British economy to pass before it joins. These mostly cover the impact of the euro on Britain's international competitiveness, but the most important of them requires Britain and Europe's economic cycles to be parallel, so that European interest rates do not cause economic harm when they are imposed on this side of the channel. Do we meet Gordon Brown's tests? Not quite. The new OECD report says Britain is close to doing so (although it also doubts the value of Brown's tests) but the recent low value of the euro against the pound means that few economists think Britain could safely join at the moment. There are signs, though, that the euro is beginning to rise in value, which would make this less of a problem. So we will join? Ah. At this point, economics matter less than politics. It looks as if Britain will meet every possible criteria for joining the single currency soon after the next election - but if the prime minister thinks the public don't want to go in, he may still shy away from holding the referendum he has promised on the issue. And even if the referendum does take place, there's no guarantee that it will be won by those who think we should join. So the pound looks safe for some time yet.

The engineer who designed it, Thomas Bouch, had taken the best advice available on wind force. On the night of December 28 1879, in a howling blizzard, the central spans of his year old bridge collapsed into the river, taking with them the Dundee express train and its 90 passengers. The game plan changed from brute strength and spectacle to durability, controlled flexibility and above all wind resistance. The result, 130 years later, is a new generation of bridges ever longer, lighter and more slender, instead of the massive towers and buttresses of the great Victorian spans. \"I think everyone loves bridges because they're so easy to understand,\" said Denis Smith, past president of the Newcomen Society, dedicated to civil engineering and industrial archaeology. \"Unlike most of civil engineering, which can seem very arcane and impenetrable to a layman, anyone can understand the principle of a bridge, and the form follows the function, which is one of the definitions of beauty.\" Dr Smith's obsessive interest in bridges is regarded as slightly over the top even by his peers in the Newcomen Society. To him the object of any journey is not the destination but the bridges deviated to along the way. He is already planning his journey to the Oresund link. \"Just think of all those little stone bridges, built by rule of thumb by some medieval stonemason, designed to carry nothing heavier than a horse and cart, which now have juggernauts thundering over them every day - they're miracles of design.\" Bridge building is a rare field in which Britain has led the world. What distinguishes British engineers from their peers abroad, he says, is their low status in the public mind. \"If I say in France that I am an engineer people expect me, however mistakenly, to be a person of culture and learning. Here I could just be the chap who comes round to mend the washing machine or the telly.\" Here, in tribute to the engineering art, are the facts about 10 splendid bridges: The Oresund link When it opens next month, it will hold the world title of longest bridge to carry both trains and motorway traffic. The road and rail link between Sweden and Denmark has taken five years to build, and includes bridges and tunnels. The main section is the 7.8km Oresund bridge, carrying cars on one deck and a two track railway on the lower deck. Clifton suspension bridge A typically audacious design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to cross a 250ft deep gorge, with a main span of 702ft. It was built against the advice of Thomas Telford, whose Menai suspension bridge had almost been destroyed by crosswinds. The original design of 1836 was modified many times in the financial crises which inevitably beset Brunel's big projects. It was completed in 1864, after Brunel's death, re-using the chains from another financially disastrous project, his Hungerford bridge in London. Tower Bridge In 1884 the corporation of London finally resolved to end the reign of the notoriously foul mouthed Thames ferrymen, and build the bridge the city desperately needed. The design, by Horace Jones and John Barry, hid under its charming Gothic exterior the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built. The hydraulically operated bascules - massive counterweights - still lift the arms to allow ships through, although since 1976 they have been driven by oil and electricity rather than steam. The bridge will close temporarily this year for the first major repairs to the bascules. Pont de Normandie Completed in 1995, this held the previous world record for longest cable-stayed - rather than suspension - bridge. Built at the mouth of the Seine, it takes 10 minutes to drive across and has withstood wind gusts of over 100mph. The Brooklyn bridge Crossing the East River in New York, it opened in 1883, 81 years after the first petition to build it. The first engineer, John A Roebling, was killed in an accident, one of 27 men who died on the site. His son, Washington Roebling, took over, became an invalid during the work, and finished supervising construction from his bedroom, with his wife relaying instructions to the builders and engineers. The Charles bridge, Prague It was begun in 1357, a date chosen, according to legend, because it was numerologically auspicious. The bridge, an outdoor gallery of baroque sculpture, outlasted wars and natural disasters to become the oldest stone bridge in central Europe. It is still the city's main meeting place, and now a haunt of buskers and traders. Sydney Harbour bridge This is the world's widest - though not longest - steel arch bridge. The central arch had to soar 134 metres above sea level to leave clearance for ships. Many of the steel parts were prefabricated in Middlesbrough, but the Australians boast that they made all 6m rivets. It opened in 1932. The Golden Gate bridge Stretched across almost a mile of San Franciso Bay, it has been named one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It opened in 1937. Its colour is officially called Golden Gate Bridge International Orange, and was chosen over conventional silver, black or dark blue after passionate argument: the US Navy is said to have wanted yellow with black stripes to make it more visible to passing ships. The Forth Railway bridge Designed by John Fowler and Benjamin Baker, the bridge was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1890 at a party attended by international VIPs including Gustav Eiffel. It became famous as the bridge where painting never stopped. When it did stop, in a cost saving exercise, there was a public outcry and the painting resumed. The Bridge of Sighs The Venetian original has been copied in at least half a dozen places, including Las Vegas and St John's College Cambridge. It was built in 1600, by Antonio Contino, to link the dreaded inquisitor's room in the doge's palace with Venice's main prison. Its name came from the prisoners' response to their last glimpse of freedom, through the small barred windows looking out towards the lagoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jun/10/hunting.ruralaffairs1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-10T01:11:55Z","webTitle":"Fearful but defiant, in the village where hunting is a way of life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/10/hunting.ruralaffairs1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jun/10/hunting.ruralaffairs1","fields":{"headline":"Fearful but defiant, in the village where hunting is a way of life","bodyText":"The headline on the local newspaper billboard says it all: \"Anxious wait for hunt report\". The people of Exford, a compact Somerset working village that nestles on the edge of Exmoor, say they have knots in their stomach as they wait for the findings of Lord Burns' inquiry to be published. Exford, more than any other place in the United Kingdom, relies on hunting for its economy. This is the home of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and a number of foxhunting packs are based here or nearby. Evidence of hunting is everywhere. Horseboxes and Range Rovers with \"Endangered Exmoor\" car stickers are all around and the howling of the kennelled hounds can be heard in the distance. In the bar of the Exmoor White Horse, the walls are hung with hunting trophies, memorabilia and pictures of the hunt. A sign on the bar says \"Hunting First: What Next?\", punters are urged to buy The Hunting Gene, a pro-hunting book, and a woman sipping a lunchtime drink has a stag's head tattooed on her arm. Here, hunting is in the blood. Statistics vary but a large number of local people say they will be badly affected if hunting with hounds is banned. Pro-hunting lobby groups assert that it will bring about the end of the rural way of life, that countless people will be made unemployed. The Countryside Alliance claims that 16,000 jobs would be lost but the Burns report is expected to put the number much lower: between 350 and 6,000. Most of those will be concentrated in the south-west, the report will say. Jeanette Branton is the owner of the village livery yard behind the Exmoor White Horse and a founder member of Endangered Exmoor, which campaigns primarily for the preservation of hunting. She keeps 15 horses for hunting people during the season, each paying £85 a week. Sitting in the tack room amid cartons of hoof oil, tins of saddle waxes and rows of tack, she says: \"If hunting was banned I wouldn't have a business at all. I rent the yard from Lord Townsend on an annual basis and I wouldn't carry on doing that. I just wouldn't have a business any more.\" Mrs Branton has worked with hunters since she was 20. During the hunting season - Exford's is a long one at nine months - she employs two local girls full- time and another two part-time. She says: \"Exford is a working village. We have got a blacksmith, a village school. Nearly everybody in Exford of working age is employed in and around the village, which is quite extraordinary. A ban would spoil Exford, a village like this would go forever.\" Shooting The Crown is a hunting hotel. Its sketches, paintings, even duvet covers are all representations of the hunt in one way or another. Mike Bradley has owned the Crown for six years and been in the Exmoor hotel business for 22 years. He estimates 15% to 20% of his business is hunting related and another 20% comes from shooting. \"We don't cater purely for field sports but the Crown has been synonymous with the hunt. It does bring a lot of revenue to the area,\" he says. \"It's very, very important as far as the hotel is concerned. The hunting and shooting are at times of the year that without it there would not be a lot of trade. It actually enables us to keep staff all the year round.\" Mark Malin runs a mobile farrier business, complete with portable forge in the back of his van. \"In an average week, 50% of my earning comes from hunting - if not a little more. If that were to go I couldn't earn a living,\" he shouts over the sizzling as he brands a hot horseshoe into the hoof of Reggie, a hunter. In the village post office, postmaster Dave Whitehouse runs the post office counter, a sorting office with four postmen, and the retail side of the shop. If hunting is banned, he fears an exodus from the village. \"I reckon hunting represents 50% of my business.\" More likely to be directly affected by a ban is Donald Summersgill, huntsman with the Devon and Somerset Staghounds. Along with a kennelman and two whipper-ins, he is in charge of 124 dogs. Mr Summersgill, 34, left school with no qualifications. He has reached the top of his profession and lives in a tied cottage next to the kennels. His council tax, electricty and fuel bills are all paid by the hunt. He says he does not know what he will do if there were to be a ban. \"I have never worked at or done anything else,\" he says. \"I can't even drive a tractor. \"I wouldn't be no good doing farm work or anything like that. I would have to be retrained completely - the government would have to come up with something.\" As he walks through the kennels, past the flesh cut from some stillborn calves and over to the gate behind which scrabble a few dozen bitches, Mr Summersgill shakes his head in regret. He calls each of the hounds' names and they in turn come to the gate for a little affection. He says: \"It's my life, it's all I do. I eat, breathe, sleep hunting.\" Like many others, Sid Westcott, master of the Minehead Harriers who hunt foxes, says the whole area would be \"devastated\" financially and socially. He lists the \"countless\" businesses that will be affected. He cites the social occasions organised by his hunt alone and points to a calendar of events that has at least one official social gathering every month. \"Hunting keeps people together. They have got a common language,\" he says. Cruelty But others in Exford have quietly raged against the hunt, campaigning to have it banned for what they see as its unnecessary cruelty. Nigel Winter is one of those. He runs Exmoor Lodge, a vegan B&amp;B in the heart of the village. He even has a \"Ban Hunting With Hounds\" sticker in the window and disputes that the village will be destroyed by a ban. He says a large number of tourist will not come to the area because they don't like hunting. \"I went to a meeting at which they said about 40 jobs would go but I think in total the hunt employs about 10 people,\" he says. \"There are people who support my point of view and quietly tell me so. One couple told me that they are opposed to hunting but they don't actually tell anyone because they are concerned what might happen to their jobs. And then there are a small number who are very anti me being here. I do get some abuse. \"One chap challenged me about my anti-hunting sticker. I said everyone was entitled to their own opinion, and he said, 'If you live round here you are not.' \" Graham Floyd, of the League of Cruel Sports sanctuary on Exmoor, agrees. He used to follow the Devon and Somerset Staghounds but is now backing a complete ban. \"There are far more people against hunting on Exmoor but are too scared to say anything about it,\" he says. If the government goes ahead with a move to ban hunting with hounds, however, Exford will not go quietly. \"We are not going to say that's it, we better just carry on with our lives,\" says Mrs Branton. \"The countryside is really going to rebel against a ban. I am not going to say that we are going to fight or there will be a civil war. But I am sure Mr Blair will be aware that it is going to cause huge unrest in the countryside.\" In Exford, people are not prepared to say they will break the law and carry on hunting. But sometimes, when they are talking about the sport, their eyes tell you a different story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jun/11/theobserver.uknews1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-11T21:55:01Z","webTitle":"News in brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/11/theobserver.uknews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jun/11/theobserver.uknews1","fields":{"headline":"News in brief","bodyText":"Police seize £11m cannabis Three men and a woman were being questioned after nearly three tonnes of cannabis with a potential street value of £11 million was seized at a smallholding north of Bracknell, Berks.

A condition report on the ship, which has spent the past 30 years in dry dock in Bristol, where it was built, has shocked its trustees. It shows that years of expensive work have done nothing to arrest corrosion of the hull. Some of the restoration work - including an expensive new deck which rotted within 10 years and has now been replaced - has made the ship's problems worse. Matthew Tanner, the ship's curator, said: \"This is simply one of the most important and influential ships in the world, but we have a terrifyingly small window in which to save her.\" Brunel, the maverick engineering genius, had already built an enormous wooden paddle ship, the Great Western, but realised he needed to build bigger to beat the competition to carry passengers to America. His solution was a propeller-driven iron ship, with sails to save fuel in the right winds. The Great Britain was launched by the technology-loving Prince Albert in 1843. However, its design was considered so radical that only 50 nervous passengers bought tickets for the first journey to New York, despite the ship's luxurious facilities. The report says extensive conservation work must begin within five years. Rust is swelling the ship's iron plates, which are laid in the same way as the planks of a clinker-built wooden boat, and bursting them off their ribs. Dozens of rust holes are stuffed with chicken wire to stop pigeons flying into the hull and the 19th century dry dock itself is leaking, so the ship is surrounded by damp. Long before it collapsed, the ship would become so dangerous that the public would be barred from visiting. Ships were never designed to last longer than a few decades and the long-term conservation problems, particularly once they are taken out of the water, are notorious. The famous tea clipper, the Cutty Sark, kept in dry dock at Greenwich, in south-east London, has similar problems. The Great Britain's trustees, along with conservation architect, Julian Harrap, have devised a striking solution: a glass artificial waterline, which would cut the humidity, stop the rot, give the illusion of the ship floating on water, and still allow visitors to walk around the hull on the floor of the dock. The glass alone would cost £1m, and the trustees have applied for a lottery grant towards the £7m project. The Great Britain had a long but star-crossed working life. In 1846 it ran aground in Northern Ireland. None of the 180 passengers, including a troupe of 48 German dancing girls, was injured, and a group of clergymen conducted a service to calm their nerves. The ship lay on the beach \"like a useless saucepan\", as Brunel raged, for a year until he devised a rescue so expensive that it bankrupted the vessel's operators. The ship was sold in 1850 for £18,000, a fraction of its original cost. Converted to sail it took thousands of emigrants to Australia. In 1861 it carried the first England cricket team to tour Australia - they played 12 matches, won six, lost two and drew four. In 1886 it ran aground again on the Falkland Islands and spent another 50 years as a floating wool store. Then in 1937 the ship was abandoned at Sparrow Cove. Historians never forgot the Great Britain, and eventually Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire, backed a spectacular rescue, which led to the ship being towed back to Britain in 1970. More than 4m people have visited the ship since then, but visitor numbers have been falling and are now down to 100,000 a year. The trustees are convinced their new plan would reverse the slump."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.features111","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-12T00:52:20Z","webTitle":"Eton, beagling, and history of art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.features111","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.features111","fields":{"headline":"Eton, beagling, and history of art","bodyText":"How well has William been educated and trained for inheriting the crown? It is not possible to make a sensible assessment of that issue without asking a more fundamental question: what kind of king does the country need? While there is now, according to much of the evidence, no real enthusiasm for a republic, there is certainly a range of views about the monarchy and its future. There are large numbers of citizens who are very critical of the personal behaviour of some individual members of the royal family. They also criticise the present financial arrangements whereby the taxpayer pays about twice as much as other Europeans pay for their royal families. (Do the Windsors really need five palaces as well as Sandringham and Balmoral?) As a reaction to much unfavourable publicity in the 1990s, the royal \"firm\" set up a small working party - the Way Ahead Group - to improve their public image, but there is little indication that they seriously considered the preparation of William for his future role. What kind of role should it be? In a recent book about royal education, Peter Gordon and I began by looking at the changes over time in the role of the monarch - from the almost absolute power of the Tudors, to limitations placed on their absolutism by parliaments in the 17th century (when one king, Charles I, was executed and another, James II, was thrown out). We looked at further moves towards a constitutional monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries and finally to the present situation, where monarchs have virtually no power but retain some of the symbols of power. For example, the Queen's speech and the ability to dissolve parliaments remain as misleading impressions of real power. Part of the training of modern monarchs has to be how to cope with such ambiguities: how to take ceremonial occasions seriously without being confused by the difference between appearance and reality. (That was one of the mistakes of the Queen's uncle, Edward VIII, and one of the reasons why he abdicated and was replaced by his more compliant brother.) The problem of preparing individuals for this strange role is complex. Yet little thought seems to have been given to the kind of education future kings or queens should have. The problem is that the monarchy as an institution inevitably conflicts with some of the principles of modern democracy, such as equality of opportunity. Our present Queen's education was left almost entirely to a young nanny - Crawfie - whose own education was extremely limited. The top priority for Elizabeth's parents was that she should have a happy childhood, and they interpreted this to mean no school, no university, nothing too demanding. When Crawfie later broke the rules and wrote a book about life with the royals, she said she was surprised that the King and Queen showed so little interest in their daughter's education. Although Elizabeth has, superficially, coped reasonably well with her constitutional position, it is said that she finds the company of academics and intellectuals difficult. Compared with many of her predecessors - Elizabeth I, for example - she has made little contribution to the artistic or intellectual life of her country. But Elizabeth I's education had been carefully planned according to Renaissance theories of education; she had been given the best tutors available, including Roger Ascham - not only a great scholar but an excellent teacher who wrote one of the best books of the 16th century about education, The Schoolmaster. Queen Elizabeth I surprised a group of foreign ambassadors by her ability to converse in French, Latin and Italian, and she had a real grasp of the theological, political and other issues of the day. A little more thought was given to the education of the present Prince of Wales. His education at Gordonstoun, inspired by the German educator Kurt Hahn, seems to have produced an individual who cares about society and the environment, but his lower-second Cambridge arts degree has left him confused, prejudiced against science and much too fond (for a future constitutional monarch) of putting forward personal views as facts rather than opinions. What kind of education was \"planned\" for William? At age three, William became a pupil at Mrs Mynor's private nursery school in west London. He stayed there until 1987 when he transferred to Wetherby School in Kensington, an exclusive pre-preparatory school. After three years he became a boarder at a preparatory school - Ludgrove School in Wokingham. His curricular and extracurricular activities were typical for boys going on to an elite independent school and university. In 1995, when he was 13, William passed his Common Entrance examination and proceeded to Eton, the most exclusive school in England. He followed the normal Eton curriculum and wore the distinctive Eton uniform designed to mark off the privileged pupils from the less privileged outsiders: black tailcoats, striped trousers, white ties. Having been taught in small classes compared with state schools, it was not surprising that William passed 12 subjects at GCSE; he went on to study geography, biology and history of art for A-levels. His university course has yet to be made public but it is likely to be history of art at a non-Oxbridge University, probably Edinburgh. The arrangements for \"preparing\" William for kingship also included the appointment of Tiggy Legge-Bourke: following the official separation of Charles and Diana in 1992, Legge-Bourke was appointed as a companion/nanny to William and Harry whenever they stayed with Charles. Her official position was assistant to the Prince of Wales's private secretary, but her duties were recreational and social - for example, helping to teach the boys to shoot rabbits. Clearly she was chosen for her social rather than intellectual accomplishments, since her academic qualifications consisted of four passes at O-level and a Montessori teaching certificate, which would not have qualified her for employment in a state school. There are three reasons for suggesting that William's education has not been an adequate preparation for a future king. First, Eton, although a \"good school\" in some respects, is an unsuitable environment for a future king. At a time when the monarchy needs to become more \"democratic\", William has been brought up in a privileged institution, where he was socialised into thinking of himself as a superior person. At Eton he also became identified with such upper-class pursuits as beagling (hunting hares with dogs) and other blood sports, which many find offensive. He has mixed throughout his schooling with a limited section of the population. His education and training should have broadened his social experience, but have restricted it instead. Second, the choice of history of art at university will not be adequate unless supplemented by courses that will give him a thorough understanding of the British constitution and his future position within it. A constitutional monarch has to learn that it is not possible to accept all the privileges of the role while ignoring its responsibilities and limitations; a special kind of moral education is needed. And does he know enough about national finances and how the parliamentary system works? Does he understand the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations and other international organisations? Finally, William needed to learn not to abuse his privileged position to foist his views on the rest of the population. The country needs someone who will demonstrate that he can have a useful but limited role in a modern democratic society. One of the dangers of being \"prepared\" for monarchy is that the deference paid to royalty, plus the privileged lifestyle, may actually encourage royals to believe that they are superior. That is not the kind of king the country wants or needs. The advantage of having a monarch rather than a presidential system is that it places the position of head of state outside politics. Some would add that a royal head of state preserves valuable historical traditions and serves to unify a kingdom by reinforcing our national heritage. That is a more controversial view, not least because it involves contradictions and tensions between the traditional role of monarch and the modern principles of democracy. Part of the education and training of a future king must be to encourage the dignified performance of the role of head of state while constantly reminding the role-player that he is a normal human being in no way superior as a person to any of his subjects. This is a difficult lesson to learn: Edward VIII never grasped the distinction and some suggest that Prince Charles has occasionally been guilty of the same delusion. In our book, Peter Gordon and I pointed out that in recent years the position of private secretary to a monarch or future monarch has been important in providing educative advice on the role of a constitutional king or queen. Several constitutional disasters have been avoided by taking good advice. We suggested that this kind of advisory role could be extended for Prince William and combined with an explicitly educative one with the appointment of a private secretary who would act also as a kind of moral tutor. Such a position would have to be filled carefully. But without some such arrangement the future of the monarchy might be in doubt. It may already be too late. Although among the population as a whole there may be royalist support of a kind, among young people - the decision-makers of the future - the picture is less comforting for those who wish to preserve the status quo. Only a few days ago it was reported that Barry Hale, an 18-year-old comprehensive school pupil from Liverpool, had written an open letter to \"Dear William\" condemning the monarchy as an outdated institution that should be abolished. The letter was the basis of a BBC TV programme which was to be shown to coincide with the Prince's 18th birthday. The BBC has now scrapped the plan, though it may be shown \"later\".

So Gordon Brown's decision to raise the universal state pension by a generous 75p a week must have been welcome news to the 74-year-old inhabitant of a modest little pile at SW1A 1AA, bringing her weekly income to an estimated £678,846.75. Or thereabouts. The real story behind the Queen's wealth is how successfully Buckingham Palace has managed to avoid embarrassing disclosures about the size of her loot. Somewhere in a tax office in Cardiff, where all the most sensitive returns are dealt with, there is a man or woman who knows more or less how much Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor is worth. Everybody else is taking wild guesses, ranging from an estimate of £2.18bn, in Eurobusiness magazine last year, to Fortune magazine, which has her sitting pretty on a £5bn nest egg. In fact, the Queen's dosh can be roughly divided into the bits we have no idea about - her private investment portfolio, where estimates range from £100m to £1.1bn - and the bits we know about but aren't really sure who owns: the Crown Estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, her jewels, stamp collection and the fabulous art collection which includes 9,000 paintings, 28,000 watercolours, and 20,000 pen-and-ink drawings, including sketches by Raphael and Da Vinci. The Sunday Times used to include the value of the collection - valuations range from £600m to £4bn - in her fortune, but they caved in to pressure from the Palace and dropped the paintings on the rather shaky grounds that, as she can't sell them, she doesn't really own them. It is an argument the Palace uses frequently to knock down some of the wilder estimates of her wealth. Thus, for example, the official Buckingham Palace website states that the jewellery, art and royal palaces belong to the Queen as sovereign, not as an individual, and thus should be excluded from estimates of her wealth. They must be handed down to the next monarch, and cannot be sold off to raise a quick bob or pay off the Queen Mum's overdraft - or so the Palace says. In fact, it's not quite that clearcut. Some of the jewellery was bought by individual sovereigns; Queen Mary snapped up the Russian imperial family's baubles at bargain-basement prices during the Depression, which suggests that her granddaughter should be free to sell them. Estimates of the value of the jewellery range from £70-£130m, although if they were ever auctioned off the bidding would go much higher than the face value of the stones, simply because of who used to wear them. Likewise, the palace was furious when the Eurobusiness survey included the Crown Estate in its estimate of the family's wealth. The estate consists of some 380,000 acres of prime land and buildings throughout the United Kingdom, valued at £1.1bn. So who owns it? Under a settlement reached in 1760, the monarchy surrenders the Crown Estate to government at the start of each reign in exchange for payments to cover its expenses - the civil list. The Treasury pockets the revenues from the Crown Estate - £125.8m in 1998-99 - while the civil list has been set at £9.79m annually since 1990. It sounds like a sweetheart deal for the taxpayer and, every so often, the palace murmurs that perhaps it should take back the revenues from the Crown Estate in exchange for covering all its own costs. But if the royals think they are entitled to the income from the Crown Estate, that surely suggests they think they still own it, despite claiming not to? Phillip Hall, historian and expert on the royal finances, says that the argument for giving the income from the Crown Estate back to the royals is disingenuous. Before George III handed over the Estate, the monarchy used the revenues to cover all the expenses of running the country apart from going to war. \"The Crown Estate income has always been for paying the expenses of government,\" says Hall. \"When the monarch was effectively the government, that is the basis on which he or she received the income. It was never private income. Now that the government is the state, the state receives it.\" So if the Palace wants to take back the Crown Estate revenues, it should cough up the £200bn annual costs of running a modern government. Not such a good deal, perhaps. The Duchy of Lancaster is another mysterious part of the royal port-folio: 51,150 acres of land and at least £35m worth of investments run like a government department, with a minister at its head, currently the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam. But all the money it generates - £5.9m a year - goes to the Queen. \"That she draws this revenue suggests that it is her private property, yet when the Palace calculates her private wealth they never include [it],\" says Hall. Eurobusiness didn't include it in their estimate of the Windsors' wealth, either. The one clear piece of the puzzle is the property that the Queen owns as an individual rather than a monarch: Sandringham and Balmoral, conservatively estimated as being worth around £100m. The most shadowy part of the Queen's finances is her personal fortune. Since 1993, she has paid tax on her private income - the fruits of her investment portfolio and the income from her private estates - but aside from that anonymous tax official in Cardiff, it's anyone's guess how much the bill is because no one can be sure how large her investments are. The most accurate figure - or at least, a figure that the Palace did not dispute at the time - was that, in 1971, her portfolio was worth around £21m. Conservatively invested, this would now be worth around £861m, according to investment bankers CSFB. Standard Life, meanwhile, values her portfolio at £1.25bn. However, the palace regularly denies that she is worth anything like this much, pointing out that she has drawn down on her capital at various times. Sources close to the palace suggest that the true value of the portfolio is more likely to be around £100m. As well as the annual income from her investments and the Duchy of Lancaster, the government provides the Queen with a sum known as the civil list, which the Palace insists is not a salary but a grant to cover some of the costs of being royal. When the government and the Palace used to haggle each year about the size of the payment, it generated plenty of embarrassing headlines about pay rises for the royals. To avoid that, the palace and the previous government agreed a deal in 1990 fixing the civil list at £9.79m a year for the rest of the decade. It was deliberately intended to be generous at the start of the period on the expectation that inflation would erode its value. In fact, inflation has been much lower than expected, so the Queen has been able to make savings from her £7.9m annual share and may even take a pay freeze for the next few years as a result. The taxpayer also forks out £15m a year for the maintenance of the five royal palaces: Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, the palace of Holyroodhouse and St James's Palace. All of this adds up to a tidy annual income of perhaps as much as £35m a year, from which the Queen runs seven properties, employs 1,300 people and subsidises several of her relatives. Taken together, the Windsors are the most expensive bunch of royals in all of Europe - in fact, the cost to the state of running them is more than the expenses of all the other royal families combined. Mr Brown's extra £39 a year for pensioners won't make a huge impression on the Queen; it might pay for an extra bunch of flowers, perhaps. In fact, the Palace says the Queen does not receive a state pension, even though, like anybody else over the age of 65, she is entitled to one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.andybeckett","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-12T00:52:37Z","webTitle":"Welcome to Charlieville","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.andybeckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.andybeckett","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to Charlieville","bodyText":"In Poundbury, gravel is an issue. At first sight, raked across the wandering pavements of Prince Charles's ideal village in Dorset, the tiny stones give the streets an attractively dusty air. When the sun shines, the cottage shadows cut the roads into tourist-brochure triangles; you could almost be in Siena, the prince's favourite town in Tuscany. And when you walk in Poundbury, as you are much encouraged to, the pavements and old-fashioned squares and courtyards crunch beneath your feet. Every step seems a slightly formal public gesture. It feels like being at a royal garden party. It is not quite as special for the residents. Some of them have been here for six years now, while the prince's town planning experiment has grown from a handful of houses to 200, enduring the builders and visiting dignitaries, the peering tourists and reporters. Yet, more than anything, they are tired of the gravel. \"That fucking stuff goes into the house,\" says an otherwise cheery retired man in cords and an anorak. The woman he is talking to gestures at her front door. \"Everyone is doormat-obsessed,\" she says. \"Because of the gravel.\" It spreads across the narrow roads, forms drifts in the gutters, gets stuck under people's shoes. A tide of small stones lies halfway up her doormat. A few rogue fragments have almost made it to the carpet. The man interjects: \"Of course, there's a security upside. It makes it difficult for burglars.\" The village has barely suffered a break-in in its history, he says. The woman, who is younger, perhaps in her 30s, interrupts in turn. \"But you can't go round and sleep with your neighbour.\" The preoccupations and peculiarities of Poundbury, like those of its patron, have long exercised a certain fascination. From its conception in the late 80s, to the planning battles and compromises of the early 90s, to its painstaking expansion since 1993, this tight hilltop maze of white walls and beige stone has become a steadily more vivid metaphor for Charles's approaching rule. The local taxi drivers call it \"Charlieville\". To its critics, it is a royal vanity - social engineering driven by self-interest (Charles owns the land and profits from every house sale) and contradictory ideals (some properties are rented cheaply through a housing association, but the use of traditional building materials makes the others more expensive than the Dorset norm). Architectural authorities, in particular, point out that Poundbury is going up, fake antique brick by fake antique brick, just when public taste is finally turning to modernity. In the London Evening Standard last year, a panel of design writers chose Poundbury as one of \"The 99 Worst Things This Century\". But its supporters are swelling in number. Last month, a government report praised its densely clustered homes, attention to detail and emphasis on pedestrians as a healthy alternative to the usual suburban sprawl. In 1998, John Prescott visited. \"What is being done here,\" he said, \"is very important work for this country's urban future.\" Poundbury's theme-park quality - its cosy reproduction of features from existing ancient villages and market towns - may actually fulfil the desires of English house-buyers. With millions of new dwellings needed, especially in southern counties like Dorset, the prince's little prototype kingdom is planned to expand far beyond its current 400 subjects. It could, to different degrees, be the future for all of us. You approach it off a roundabout. Poundbury, like Charles, is not a self-contained entity but the latest addition to an ancient institution - in this case, the former Roman town of Dorchester. Poundbury is out by the bypass, beyond the genteel Georgian facades, the Victorian terraces and the 20s council houses. The weather on this side of town is locally described as \"draughty\". Amid the crisp new walls and doorstep plant pots, along the roads free of dustbins and litter and modern traffic markings, whole minutes pass without a pedestrian. The odd builder's van or resident's Volvo squeezes round the blind corners, grumpily changing gear. Barely another sound carries across the rooftops. In the squares, the benches stand expectant and unused. The prince's saplings rustle in the breeze. There is only one shop. A pub and cafe and corner shop are planned to open later this summer; until then, to gossip and get out of the rain, people have had to make do with an interior design showroom. The Stitchinghouse has no sign outside - Charles disapproves of gaudy shop fronts - and closes at four in the afternoon. At lunchtime, there are two people in the shop, discussing archery and Nigel Kennedy's failure to shave. Sue McCarthy-Moore, the owner, is sewing a quilted curtain attachment. She is very keen on Poundbury. \"I've lived here since the beginning,\" she says. \"It's safe. It's friendly . . . I like the attention to detail. I think it's nice not to have TV aerials and telegraph poles.\" In a loud, well-informed voice, she takes issue with a recent newspaper letter from the architect Richard Rogers criticising Poundbury. \"People here get interested in design. There's zero crime. People look out for each other.\" She picks up the cushion by one of its reproduction brass rings. \"At least Charles was brave enough to have a go.\" Her neighbours appear to agree. They are retired couples, many of them, who wear the country uniform of the prosperous: smart cardigans and cords, green quilted jackets and V-necked jumpers just like Charles's. For royalists, there are a reassuring number of Commonwealth citizens. A dapper man from Sydney is unloading books from a lorry. Is he worried about the wind? \"They're supposed to be very fuel efficient houses.\" Poundbury feels carefully worked out. There is a monthly organic market and an alternative medicine clinic. There is a business park, with factory buildings like Tuscan farm compounds, their ugly money-making ducts and pipes hidden behind red towers and pretty walls. There is a maker of \"fine chocolates\" and a cereal manufacturer promoting \"healthy eating\". The prince's every crusade and polemic is represented here in picture-postcard form. A manifesto of sorts has been inscribed on the inside of the Millennium Belvedere Tower, a small stone pavilion in a field on the southern edge of the settlement, quoting Clough Williams-Ellis, the architect of the utopian Welsh village Portmeirion: \"We must preserve what may be of our ancient heritage . . . that desolation be stayed, that standards of graciousness may here and there persist.\" The Poundbury ideal took shape during that great decade of revivals, the 80s. In 1984, the prince began attacking modern architecture and praising the \"eternal\", \"natural\" forms and ways of life that had only really existed in Britain before the Industrial Revolution. By 1989, with his television documentary and polemical volume, A Vision of Britain, a programme for rescuing his future kingdom from concrete and alienation had been devised. \"We do not have to live in surroundings that directly reflect the latest technology,\" he wrote. Instead, developments should be built \"on a more intimate scale\"; \"a sense of hierarchy\" should be restored to buildings; \"good lettering must be taught and learned\". To illustrate these principles, he would \"produce something of real beauty in the English countryside\". Through the Duchy of Cornwall, which had provided an income for male heirs to the throne since the 14th century, the prince owned large pockets of south-west England. One piece of land was outside Dorchester; the local council wanted to see houses built on it. The result was Poundbury. Its evolution has not been as natural as its royal overseer probably intended. Its Englishness, for one thing, was in question from the start: Leon Krier, the planner Charles chose, was from Luxembourg; and Krier's initial models imagined Poundbury as a perfect Italian town, with campaniles, rotundas and unlikely-looking trees from the Mediterranean. These grand designs had to be simplified and shrunk and made to reflect the settlement's cool, green surroundings. The property price slide of the early 90s slowed construction further. Yet nowadays, at the small Duchy outpost in Poundbury, modest satisfaction is the order of the day. The houses are selling. \"He's happy, I think - generally,\" says Simon Conibear, the development manager. Plans for buildings still go to the prince, but he consults before making his mind up. His exercise of power over the hilltop is \"constitutional\". As Charles's ambassador in the village, Conibear has two ways of behaving. Out in the street, in his old-fashioned suit, he strides through endless tours, greets locals, and even borrows a phrase from the anti-capitalist protests: \"We've reclaimed the streets from cars.\" But in his office, amid the bright lighting and decor that usually sits behind Poundbury facades, he is much more hard-headed. \"This is the most profitable development per acre in Dorchester,\" he says. He shows the plans for the settlement's ultimate shape: over 2,000 buildings, over 6,000 inhabitants, the current \"village\" a mere thumbnail. \"A few key houses with period detail,\" he says. \"Fill in the gaps with a lot of concrete blocks and render.\" Poundbury's air of quiet can deceive in other ways. It is, to an extent, an enforced calm: there are rules against ball games in public courtyards; rules against altering the outside of properties; a £70 annual charge for the upkeep of the roadside trees and flowerbeds. And there is the residents' association. Attendance at meetings is high. Warnings are given about talking to reporters. References in the minutes to \"the Poundbury Concept\" are in capital letters. A recent minor bit of vandalism is crossly attributed to culprits \"not local to Poundbury\". Yet the place has its tensions. The social housing, to look at, is admirable: well built, no smaller than the rest, discreetly scattered. Young mothers and men with tattoos tend their flowers like everyone else.

Testifying on the fourth day of the King Commission hearings, Bacher further alleged that two Pakistan games in last year's World Cup in England - against Bangladesh and India - were fixed. Bacher, the managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, broke into tears as he painted a damning picture of global match-fixing corruption. He said an Indian bookmaker, revealed only as Mr R, had told him that Akhtar, the Pakistani umpire, had been bought before the match by \"one of the biggest bookmakers in Karachi\". \"There were 10 lbw decisions in that match,\" Bacher told the commission. \"Nine were made by Javed Akhtar, eight were against South Africa and seven were considered dubious by knowledgeable observers. \"Mr R told me that the Karachi bookmaker had even travelled to Leeds a few days before that test to make sure his client complied.\" England won on the last morning by 23 runs to clinch a thrilling 2-1 series victory. Bacher, who also named the former test batsman Majid Khan as a source of his information, said he first met Mr R in 1995 and was confident that he was \"above board\". He said he could not name him because he was concerned for the man's safety. In an even more bizarre piece of evidence, Bacher substantiated his previous claims that two World Cup games were fixed by producing a letter from a South African businessman, Jacques Sellschop. In his letter Sellschop recounted in detail a conversation he allegedly had with the Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, in which Shoaib claimed Pakistan were paid $1m (£660,000) to throw the game against Bangladesh. \"So many matches were fixed that I was not able to remember all of them,\" Sellschop said in his letter to Bacher. \"[Shoaib] said the match between Pakistan and Bangladesh was fixed and the Pakistan side received $1m. He said it was very common and that you only needed three or four players to make it work. \"He said Hansie [Cronje] had been so stupid, that you only dealt with these people through a third party and never on the phone. He also said that at least one match on Pakistan's tour to South Africa in 1998 had been fixed and that many leading players had offshore bank accounts in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Cayman Islands.\" Pakistan's 62-run loss to Bangladesh was the upset of the World Cup. Against India at Old Trafford, they were bowled out for 180 chasing 228 for victory. Sellschop said he did not know the man who had introduced himself as the world's fastest bowler, but he had later seen a photograph of Shoaib and had no doubt that it was him. He said \"Shoaib\" also implicated Australia in match-fixing, saying \"The Australian authorities deal with it more sensibly but they are heavily involved in making money like this.\" There was also no respite for Cronje yesterday, with his team-mates Mark Boucher and Lance Klusener hammering yet more nails into their former captain's shattered career by confirming that he had \"mentioned some sort of fix\" before South Africa's second test against India in March this year. Neither player took it seriously but, with the benefit of hindsight, both admitted that the offer was probably serious. The hearing was also told that over $47,000 (£31,000) was deposited into a Cronje bank account barely a week after the match-fixing scandal first broke in April. Cronje, though, is not due on the stand this week after all as his senior counsel, John Dickerson, has prior engagements. Bacher, asked about the impact of the revelations that Cronje had accepted money from bookmakers and offered bribes to team-mates, said: \"It has devastated the country ... and I don't think we have recovered.\" For Cronje the pain is relentless. He is understood to have accepted the prosecutor's offer of indemnity and is willing to tell everything. Throwing himself at the mercy of Judge Edwin King is now his only choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2000/jun/13/tvandradio.television3","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-13T01:34:02Z","webTitle":"A fool and his money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jun/13/tvandradio.television3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jun/13/tvandradio.television3","fields":{"headline":"A fool and his money","bodyText":"Alot of waffle has been talked and written about TV alternatives to football as we enter the scheduling free-for-all that is Euro 2000. But if you wanted to escape far, far away from sport last night, Channel 4 had the dream ticket - or, as it turned out to be, nightmare. True Stories: Pimp Snooky was one of the most infuriating, depressing and exhilarating pieces of television to come this way for a long time - a trip deep, deep into the underworld in the demonic company of Milwaukee's premier procurer. Snooky, a handsome man in his late 20s or early 30s, ran a stable of prostitutes from a smart-looking house in the city. He cruised around in his flash Mercedes looking for fresh talent: \"gonna find me a new bitch today\", he said, putting on his headhunter's charm. It didn't last long. Once the new bitch, a hapless creature named Mika, had been recruited, she was subjected to a programme of mental torture that left her - and viewers - gasping with shock. Pimp Snooky was filmed over a 12-month period last year by Clive Gordon, a man who clearly knows no fear in pursuit of a good story. Such was the rapport between film-maker and subject that Snooky allowed Gordon to witness the most revealing moments of his life: knocking his girls around, trying to stay calm during a drive- by shooting, or coming sheepishly out of prison. He emerged, blinking and shaken, into the daylight, his drab sportswear in sharp contrast to his more usual pimp threads. \"I look like a trick\", he complained. \"They treated me like a trick.\" You might have expected the film to reveal a warm, caring side to Snooky, or to have led us to understand and perhaps sympathise with his way of life. But as he showed more and more of himself, we could only come to loathe him. His treatment of his women - and their terrified, brainwashed compliance - was jaw-droppingly horrible. He employed his nephew, a young man of about 19, to attempt to seduce the girls under concealed video surveillance; if they succumbed, they faced the wrath of \"Daddy\". He nutted Mika on the forehead, and would have done much worse had he not suddenly become aware of the camera's presence. He bragged endlessly about his financial acumen, and even organised a glitzy party (The International Players' Convention) to celebrate the pimp lifestyle. If all this sounds disgusting, it was - and yet it was impossible to stop watching. The Players' Convention was shown in slow-motion, the girls writhing obediently at the feet of their men, a carnival vision of hell. Mika's training by two of her \"wives-in-law\", Fantasia and Unique, was a ridiculous parody of sisterhood. \"You say yes and no, you call him Daddy at all times, you walk behind him, open doors, wait for him to get out of the car before you do. He puts his ho's on pedestals. He treats us like queens, so we gotta treat him like a king.\" And Snooky was a king in his own kingdom, a dictator no less. God help the girl who stepped out of line. Mika, who, it transpired, was only 18 and unprepared for life on the game, had her wrathful family on Snooky's tail, and we feared for her life. Gratifyingly, this little dystopia began to fall apart in the final section of the film. After the tacky climax of the Convention, Snooky spent a night in prison, endured gunmen shooting at his house and, we suspected, had heavier foes than Mika's irate uncle to deal with. The enemy was at the gates, and it was hard to fathom what was going on. Snooky remained calm throughout, but he was running scared. At the time of transmission, Snooky was in prison - probably the safest place for him, and it's a miracle that one of his bitches didn't pick up a gun and blow his head off first. Clive Gordon deserves to be showered with awards for having the guts to bring back this report from the pit. Presumably he developed some kind of rapport with Snooky (who called Gordon from jail, begging him to bail him out), but even so he didn't let it get in the way of this cold, dispassionate dissection. The rap soundtrack, with its usual catalogue of bragging and swearing, seemed comically feeble compared to the reality on screen. \"I'm not no crazy sadistic fucked- up-in-the-head fool\", said Snooky. Oh, but you are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2000/jun/14/guardiansocietysupplement3","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-14T14:50:02Z","webTitle":"Growth is good for the poor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/jun/14/guardiansocietysupplement3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/jun/14/guardiansocietysupplement3","fields":{"headline":"Growth is good for the poor","bodyText":"The protesters against the world trade talks in Seattle last December and against the World Bank and IMF in April succeeded in getting their main argument widely accepted: namely, that global free trade is widening the gap between rich and poor both within countries and between them. There is overwhelming statistical evidence for this view. The United Nations Development Project has been saying it for several years. Its 1999 Human Development Report stated that the income gap between the fifth of the world's people living in the richest countries and the fifth in the poorest was 74 to 1 in 1997, up from 60 to 1 in 1990 and 30 to 1 in 1960. Within countries, inequality had been rising since 1980 it said, citing China, the countries of eastern Europe and the CIS, and OECD countries, \"especially Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States\" as examples. But the free traders, led by the World Bank, are fighting back. Their new weapon, widely hailed in the financial press last week, is a long, detailed economic research paper full of equations and theory, called Growth is Good for the Poor, by David Dollar and Aart Kraay, of the World Bank's development research group. The Financial Times said that the paper \"provides what appears to be incontestable evidence\" that sustained growth raises the real incomes of the poor and that growth is \"helped along by just the policies many of the demonstrators oppose: by macro-economic stability and openness to trade\". Even the Guardian joined in. Mark Atkinson wrote on the economic pages that the report illustrated \"the harm that would be inflicted on the poor if governments were to listen too hard to the protesters at Seattle and retreat from open markets\". It does no such thing. As Dollar and Kraay's purported conclusions seem set to become one of the myths of our time, to be used triumphantly whenever arguments about globalisation break out, it is worth looking at what their report actually says, and what its figures really show, rather than the spin which is being loaded on to them. Labelled \"preliminary and incomplete\", their paper claims that 370 observations from 125 countries over four decades show that: • When a country grows economically, the incomes of the poor - the bottom 20% of the population on the income scale - tend to rise at the same percentage rate as those of everyone else. • The incomes of the poor do not drop by proportionately more than those of the better-off in economic crises. This applies to poor countries as well as richer ones. • The relationship has not changed in recent years as countries have progressively opened themselves up to the free movement of goods, services and capital. • Openness to international trade benefits the poor to the same extent as everyone else. • Government spending on primary education and democratic institutions doesn't do anything to raise the share of national income going to the poor. • Cutting government expenditure and curbing inflation raise the growth rate. They also seem to give the poor a larger share of the higher incomes that result. • State social spending does not increase the growth rate. Nor does it increase the share of national income going to the poor. The final three remarkable conclusions have been greeted with glee by economic fundamentalists and require an investigation by themselves. In the space available here, the best we can do is to look at the claim hard-wired to the paper's title, that growth is good for the poor because it raises their incomes by as much as those of everyone else. Since the poorest fifth of the population in every country gets only a tiny fraction of total national income - in the US, for example, it gets 4.2% - one explanation for D&amp;K's results could be that their data isn't accurate enough to pick up the real changes taking place. A 1% error, for example, could mean that the poor had lost a quarter of its income, without it showing in the figures. \"There's a lot of approximation,\" says Ray Thomas, who teaches statistics at the Open University. \"Estimating the income of the bottom 20% [they way D&amp;K have done] is defensible because of the lack of any alternative. But it is not really good enough when the aim of the exercise is to make generalisations about the average income level of the bottom 20%.\" Especially, as Dollar and Kraay write, they know very little about what has happened to the distribution of income within the bottom 20%. Thomas thinks that as the bulk of the incomes received by the bottom 20% go to the richer members of it, their figures might well be missing what's happening to the poorest of the poor. So the most likely explanation of the conflict between the UNDP statistics and Dollar and Kraay's is inadequate data. \"For most countries, only one or a handful of observations are available,\" their paper admits. Moreover, even if we accept the paper's finding that the incomes of the poor grew at the same rate as the rich in percentage terms, what this means in real life is that the absolute number of possessions the rich could afford was growing much faster than those of the poor. If the top 80% of the population had 96% of the income and the bottom 20% had 4% initially, 25% growth would have enabled the poor to acquire one more possession for every 20 acquired by the better off. But this is playing the economists at their own game by measuring everything in money terms. This is a mistake because when economic growth takes place, almost everything in society and the economy changes, and even if incomes rise sharply it is impossible to say without a detailed social investigation whether the population of the country concerned becomes better off. For example, because the growth statistics only measure the monetarised parts of the economy, they ignore those things that people do for themselves. Thus, if a child is cared for by its mother at home, that does not contribute to national income and hence growth. If it is placed with a childminder, it does. A meal in McDonald's adds more to gross national product than a meal cooked at home. Growth can therefore be generated by making people less self-reliant. Whether this indicates they are better off is another question. Supposing, for example, that when a third world country opened up its economy to the world its agricultural workers were required to become more mechanised. If, as a result, fewer workers were needed in the countryside and they moved to city slums, growth could well be generated by such a change and the incomes of the people who moved could well be higher than they were in their villages. However, as they would then have to buy all their food and fuel rather than producing it for themselves, and might have to pay rent and fares for the first time, they could easily be much worse off. Dollar and Kraay's paper is not pure research. It is a political document written, as Dollar told me, because \"we were afraid that the current debate on globalisation was losing sight of the basic fact that the status of the poor is linked to the overall health of the economy. If the economy is not growing, it is very unlikely that the poor are doing well.\" That's true, but only because we have an economic system that, whatever damage it is doing to people's lives or to the environment, has to continue to expand if it is not to collapse, taking the poor, and the rest of us, with it. Instead of acting as growth promoters, D&amp;K would have been better employed investigating how the system has to be changed so that growth can be brought to a stop without costing millions of the poor what little income they have. Indeed, if we turn its findings around, what their paper shows is that the impoverished are being used as the excuse for continuing with a growth process that is failing to make the poorest any better off in relative terms. After all, if the income of the poor rises only one-for-one with overall growth, they'll never, ever, catch up. • Richard Douthwaite, a former Department of the Environment economist, is the author of The Growth Illusion: How Economic Growth Enriched the Few, Impoverished the Many and Endangered the Planet (Green Books, £12.95).

The revelation that transfusions might now be acceptable, apparently decided by the church's world governing body by a vote of eight to four at a secret meeting last month, caused anguish and astonishment to adherents that one of the central tenets of the faith - and the cause of death for thousands of members over the years - was being abandoned. The decision means that members who accept transfusions may not be automatically expelled and shunned, so long as they repent and seek spiritual guidance. The church fears that disaffected members whose relatives have died after refusing blood may now seek damages. The witnesses' British headquarters at Watch Tower House in north London described the decision, which will be conveyed to members at Kingdom halls across the country by letter as \"a minor procedural change\". Geoffrey Unwin, an author and former Jehovah's Witness specialising in writing about cults, who broke the story in Britain, said: \"Witnesses are in a state of self denial at the moment. They will be shocked that the elders who are supposed to get their messages direct from God should have voted for a change like this. \"Countless thousands whose relatives have been allowed to die needlessly will be angered that this could now be changed by a bunch of old men hiding in a room in New York after supposedly talking to God. They must be terrified of litigation.\" Jehovah's Witnesses believe that as life is a gift from God, blood should not be intermingled, taking their text from Acts chapter 15, verse 20, which instructs the faithful to abstain from things \"polluted by contact with idols, from fornication, from anything that has been strangled and from blood.\" The religion's 130,000 British adherents - among 6m worldwide - are not supposed to accept blood transfusions even if refusal results in their death. In January Beverley Matthews, 33, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, died after refusing a blood transfusion and last week a teenager, Brent Bond, of Nottingham, accepted a transfusion only seconds before lapsing into unconsciousness after losing five pints of blood in a machete attack. The church said yesterday that he was not a Jehovah's Witness because he had not been baptised in the faith, although his mother who is a member, tried to prevent the operation. Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for the strictness of their observance. Members do not give presents at Christmas or birthdays, exchange greetings with non-believers or allow their children to take part in games or plays at school. Even use of the internet is frowned upon. The church insisted yesterday that the New York decision was clarification of existing rules and a simplification of the process of excommunication, though that came as a surprise to some witnesses. Paul Gillies, the church's spokesman said: \"If someone accepts a transfusion in a moment of weakness and then regrets it afterwards we can offer assistance, just as if they had committed adultery. But if they are no longer living by the rules they have excluded themselves. \"Nowadays the movement towards bloodless health care means we have had members who have had open heart surgery and liver transplants without using blood.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2000/jun/16/guardianobituaries1","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-16T01:04:27Z","webTitle":"General Sir James Glover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jun/16/guardianobituaries1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2000/jun/16/guardianobituaries1","fields":{"headline":"General Sir James Glover","bodyText":"General Sir James Glover, who has died aged 71, was one of a rare breed who, after a highly successful military career, moved effortlessly to an equally successful career on retirement. He was a natural soldier, with the army in his blood. Mens sana in corpore sano could have been written to describe his ethos. His ordered mind was represented in remarkably neat and regular handwriting. That was the outward and visible sign of a clear-sighted and intensely capable man, who was known for never doing things by halves - as in his typically clear assessment of the IRA when he was the senior army officer involved with intelligence work in Northern Ireland. James, or \"Jimmy\" as he was universally known, was born in India, where his father, who also became a general, was serving with the Indian army. After Wellington College and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, he was commissioned, in 1949, into the Royal Artillery, with which he served until 1956. He then transferred to the Rifle Brigade, then on operations in Malaya. On return to England, he attended the staff college, to which he had obtained a competitive entry, in 1959, from where he was appointed brigade major of 48 Gurkha Infantry Brigade in Hong Kong. In 1963, Glover returned to his battalion, then in Cyprus, and, in 1967, after attending the Joint Services Staff College, went back as a member of the directing staff, being promoted lieutenant-colonel at the youngest age possible. In 1970, he was given command of his battalion, now 3rd battalion, the Royal Green Jackets, commanding it on operations in Northern Ireland and with the United Nations peace-keeping force in Cyprus. He also organised a memorable parade to mark the temporary reduction of the battalion to a company, about which Sir Arthur Bryant wrote most movingly on the demise of his favourite regiment, the Rifle Brigade. From then on, Northern Ireland dominated Glover's career, certainly in the minds of the public who take an interest in the province. After promotion to colonel, and a first tour in the Ministry of Defence - in charge of the branch responsible for all operational deployments - and attendance at the Royal College of Defence Studies, he became Brigadier-General Staff (Intelligence), or BGS (Int), the senior army officer involved with intelligence work in Northern Ireland. This was followed by promotion, firstly to major-general, as commander, Land Forces, Northern Ireland, and then to lieutenant-general, as deputy chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence), the senior military intelligence post, which he held during the Falklands war. But it was for a leaked document, entitled Future Terrorist Trends, written while he was still BGS (Int), that Jimmy became a well-known figure. In it, he pointed out that the IRA had taken a calculated decision to regroup from their earlier position of weakness. It now had a new and effective cellular structure, and was equipped with all the sinews of war - men, money and weapons - and must be taken seriously. This typically accurate assessment, however unpalatable to those who did not want to accept it, enabled the army to respond appropriately. Ten years later, Glover gave an equally forthright interview on the BBC's Panorama programme, in which he pointed out that the Provisional IRA could never be defeated militarily, being dedicated to what it called the long war, and that Gerry Adams was a man \"with whom we can do business\". Glover's only other military appointments were both connected with Northern Ireland. As vice-chief of the General Staff, with membership of the army board, from 1983-84, he was the immediate day-to-day link with the commander-in-chief, and, in his final appointment, with the rank of general, as commander-in-chief, United Kingdom Land Forces, he was responsible for the dispatch of troops to the province. It was from this appointment that Jimmy went to great lengths to develop the army's links with the community. This included a number of briefings for senior people, including businessmen, from which he received an immediate invitation to join the board of British Petroleum on retirement. He was also asked to chair the company responsible for building and operating the new Royal Armouries in Leeds, and, in 1997, became chairman of Merlin Communications International, the company formed from the privatised international transmission arm of the BBC. His retirement was thus as active as his military service. Glover was awarded the MBE in 1964, the KCB in 1981, and appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hampshire in 1997. But he will, above all, be remembered as a cheerful companion, and a generous and welcoming host, with his wife Janet, whom he married in 1958. She survives him, with their two children, Carolyn and Jonathan, and five grandchildren. In his younger days, Jimmy Glover was an accomplished middle-distance runner, whose classical style suggested a natural athlete. To the end, he looked lean, alert and fit, his daily routine invariably including a long walk at a brisk pace. It was typical of him that he should have spent much of his last day gardening and walking at his home.

Anglo American, the giant conglomerate which is by far the largest gold and nickel mining producer in Zimbabwe, described the president's comments as \"unhelpful\" for investor confidence. \"It's disastrous,\" said a local mining executive with Anglo American. \"Just by making such a statement Mugabe is weakening Zimbabwe's mining sector. It will have a terrible effect on mining and the entire economy.\" Many businesses are still coming to terms with the decision to confiscate more than 800 farms in Zimbabwe. The president told the Johannesburg Star newspaper: \"After land, now we must look at the mining sector ... At the end of the day black people must be able to say 'Ah, the resources are ours. Our people own the mines. Our people own the industry'.\" Mining is a key element in Zimbabwe's economy, accounting for about 30% of export earnings. The country has about 1,000 mines, of which 800 are owned by Zimbabweans, but the big mines owned by multinationals account for 60% of production. Nick von Schirnding, Anglo American's senior vice-president of investor corporate affairs, said that Mr Mugabe's statement might have been pre-election \"politicking\" rather than a direct threat. \"Anglo has certainly not been approached on this issue\", he said. \"We are confident in the long-term future of Zimbabwe. Of prime concern is economic and political stability, the rule of law and policy certainty. Free and fair elections are particularly important for investor confidence.\" The United Kingdom is the largest private sector investor in Zimbabwe, with holdings estimated to be worth £350m. The Confederation of British Industry said: \"This is potentially the start of a downward spiral which will not only critically damage Zimbabwe's economic capacity, but threatens to undermine fatally investor confidence in the country.\" The Foreign Office dismissed Mr Mugabe's remarks as \"posturing\" before the elections, due on June 24-25. \"This cannot help Zimbabwean jobs, wealth and opportunities. Zimbabwe is currently suffering from a crippling shortage of foreign exchange and a weak Zimbabwean dollar,\" said the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain. \"These threats only make matters worse and, if carried out, would risk bankrupting the country.\" President Mugabe is not learning from history, warned John Robertson, a Zimbabwean economist with extensive experience in mining. \"Look what happened to other African countries that nationalised their mines. Zambia's copper mines went into serious decline. Eventually the Zambian state had to sell the copper mines back to the original owner, Anglo American. That is a telling example for Zimbabwe.\" Mr Mugabe's warning would bring \"an immediate stop to new exploration and investment in mining in this country\", said Mr Robertson. He added that Zimbabwe's mining sector was already under siege as a result of Mr Mugabe's economic mismanagement. \"By fixing the exchange rate at an unrealistic level, the government is making the mines earn less money than they should for their exports, yet their domestic costs are going up by more than 60%.\" Zimbabwe's business and industrial leaders were similarly dismayed. \"Next he'll go after the factories,\" said Danny Meyer, director of a company that produces medical supplies and equipment and the former chairman of the Zimbabwe national chambers of commerce. \"I feel cheated,\" he added. \"For years we have stressed the need to work with government and to encourage and accelerate participation of black Zimbabweans at all levels of the economy. When Mugabe talks of ownership by black Zimbabweans, he means black members of Zanu-PF [Mr Mugabe's party]. There is no transparency in this. It is frightening.\" Morgan Tsvangirai, the president of Zimbabwe's leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that Mr Mugabe \"has no constitutional right to seize any property\". \"By making such irresponsible statements he is doing irreparable harm to the economy,\" he said. John Holloway, a Harare mining consultant, said: \"There are possible repercussions in neighbouring African countries such as Zambia and Tanzania, where there is already unease about the control of assets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jun/16/qanda.julianglover","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-16T12:08:22Z","webTitle":"Euro divisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/16/qanda.julianglover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jun/16/qanda.julianglover","fields":{"headline":"Euro divisions","bodyText":"What's happened recently? Gordon Brown and Robin Cook have both made well-reported speeches referring to the likelihood of Britain joining the single currency. The chancellor's Mansion House speech, on Thursday night, made it explicitly clear that the Treasury, rather than any other department, will decide whether the time is right for Britain to join the single currency. The foreign secretary's speech, delivered hours earlier in the Commons, did not dispute this. But journalists noticed that four short passages praising the single currency - included in the draft speech handed to journalists - were not used by Robin Cook. They were quick to interpret this as the result of efforts by the prime minister to hide differences between his chancellor and the foreign secretary. What are these differences? On specifics, it's hard to tell. Neither the chancellor nor the foreign secretary think Britain should join the single currency immediately, and neither of them wants to rule it out all altogether. Both seem to think it sensible for the government to plan a referendum on membership at some point after the next election. Gordon Brown sets great store by the five 'tests' he has devised to determine whether the time is right to join. He explained them in detail last night. As well as many economists, Robin Cook may think these tests somewhat subjective. Unlike them, he has not said so - in public, at least. So they really agree? Not quite. Robin Cook and Gordon Brown might agree about the broad sweep of policy towards the euro, but they certainly disagree when it come to the matter of tone. The chancellor's early enthusiasm for the single currency, in 1997 and 1998, has been replaced by a cautious neutrality. Some people close to him think he has become an enthusiast for the American economic model. In contrast, the foreign secretary - always a pro-European - has become openly keen on joining the single currency. His draft speech, for instance, included a promise that the government 'would not let Britain lose by staying out' - words that the chancellor would be unlikely to use. Is the government split on the issue then? To a degree. Apart from the foreign secretary, two other leading ministers; the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, would like the government to be more openly enthusiastic about the euro. But the real issue is not a fundamental split between pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but a concern on the part of pro-Europeans that the single currency is not an issue on which the government should remain neutral. They think that without a clear lead from the prime minister and the chancellor, public opinion will never swing in favour of the single currency. What about Tony Blair? The prime minister's main concern is to maintain a united front. The last thing he wants is a public split between his chancellor and his foreign secretary as the election approaches. That's why it looks like Downing Street could have been behind Robin Cook's decision not to use the most pro-euro lines in his speech (although the foreign secretary says it was a spur-of-the-moment decision he made while speaking). Privately, Tony Blair seems keener on the euro than Gordon Brown, but he wants, at all costs, to avoid the single currency becoming an election issue. That might allow William Hague to exploit public disquiet about the subject. After the election, the prime minister hopes to call a referendum on membership - but he will only do so if he thinks it can be won.

Yet it was the MPs who complained about the censorship in the first place. In an episode that would have delighted Kafka, the Guardian requested information that the Commons defence committee was told by the MoD it could not disclose. The information is readily available in the US. The committee in March published a report on military intelligence-gathering so studded with asterisks that in parts it was rendered meaningless. On other occasions the content of the censored material is so obvious that the asterisks are simply redundant. The committee's report shows that at one point Bruce George, the Labour chairman, asked senior military officers in a private hearing: \"How dependent [are] you on material provided by the United States?\" An MoD witness responds: \"***.\" \"Does the United States make available any of the material that it gives to you to any other Nato ally?\" Answer: \"***.\" Crispin Blunt, a Tory member of the committee, then asked whether \"information would not necessarily be available [in] an operation where the Americans were not involved?\" Answer: \"***.\" \"They have a veto over the process?\" Answer: \"***.\" \"But if it was an operation of which the United States disapproved?\" Answer: \"***.\" \"Then there is a problem for us and our European allies, is there not?\" Answer: \"***.\" The questioning turned to the Kosovo war. Mike Hancock, the Liberal Democrat MP, asked: \"Were we, the United Kingdom, in any way responsible for the targeting errors that related to the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade?\" Answer: \"***.\" The MoD refused to disclose under what treaty US spy planes were allowed to fly from British bases and even the number of Serb tanks seen on the ground in Kosovo during last year's Nato bombing campaign. The committee chided the ministry for being over secretive. It was also critical about the department's refusal to allow the MPs to disclose information which was freely available in the US. The Guardian requested the release of the suppressed information under the open government code. The MoD replied that it was reassessing the classification of the information in light of the committee's criticism. It added, however, that the (censored) report was \"subject to parliamentary privilege\". It was up to the committee, and not the ministry, to decide whether and how the expurgated evidence should be published.

This is hardly surprising because, although most are in grim hovels from which slum-lords make a killing, at least they can walk outside without stepping on a Nato cluster-bomblet or breathing uranium dust. Moreover, many Kosovans no longer have homes or relatives to return to. Some do wish to return. Some would just like to return to London, where they had started to make a home before being dispersed throughout the United Kingdom. The same government that spoke so tearfully about their plight while bombing Yugoslavia now wants to round them up again and kick them out. Some people who supported the bombing are appalled by this. There were those who supported the war for genuinely humanitarian reasons. They didn't give much thought to what the government might be up to. If we don't take account of motives, we won't understand what is happening or what will follow. Those who imagined that Nato was trying to help the Kosovans must either have been shocked when they learned it was showering the area with anti-personnel mines, or have imagined that they are designed to deal with the problem of ugly footwear. Depleted uranium must have been a clerical error or an attempt to have the place twinned with Iraq. It would follow that the government is forcing Kosovan refugees to return for their own good. Refugees from other parts of the world must either be being expelled for the same good motive or for motives which, although bad, contrast with the benign rationale behind the expulsion of Kosovans. Of course, some Kosovans arrived before the war started, partly because of violence and partly because the Yugoslav authorities had driven ethnic Albanians out of their jobs. This confuses the issue because, in Home Office logic, employment discrimination is not persecution, and the motive for fleeing it is financial. The same logic is applied to the Roma. The fact that a person is forced to live in poverty means that their flight is based on acquisitiveness and that they imagined any violence because they were faint with hunger. Furthermore, even if people can prove that they have been persecuted, they must also prove that the state connived in that persecution at high level. One would think all these clever immigration lawyers and traffickers would encourage victims of violence to ask for a receipt. Unlike a government, a refugee has to prove a motive. A Polish Gypsy who has been attacked by neo-Nazis while police turned a blind eye, must establish a motive for telling her story to a British immigration officer. It might be that she has a well-founded fear of persecution, or it might be that she was bored with telling the story to relatives who'd all had the same experience. If one believes that the British government is doing its best to help \"genuine\" refugees, a number of things follow. Dispersal to Belfast, for example, must be an effort to find a familiar habitat, a war zone riven by ethnic hatred being ideal. Moreover, since Ann Widdecombe is in almost total agreement with Jack Straw, either her motives are equally honourable or she has arrived at the same humane conclusions by accident. We would have to examine her views in context. Perhaps she finds herself in agreement with Jack Straw by pure chance. Whereas she agrees with making asylum seekers apply from their home countries because it will reduce numbers and pander to racism, he wants to enable them to plan their move and leave a note for the milkman. He doesn't want to make it harder for refugees to come, or to criminalise those who arrive without the right papers. He wouldn't want people who are already in danger to get arrested after telling their stories to their local British embassy, or simply to be rejected because we get on with their government. He just wants to spare them a pointless journey to Britain and possible travel sickness. For, surely, \"something must be done\" about the asylum system. As with the oppression of ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia, it doesn't matter what is done or what the consequences are, so long as it is something. It would have helped if Labour and the Tories had not whipped up racist hysteria against refugees, just as it would have helped if the west had not crippled the Yugoslav economy, but it's too late now. Some people are whipped-up and something must be done. In the case of Kosovo, the something was to make things worse, which made British liberals feel temporarily better. But that cannot have been the motive for the something, because British liberals rightly feel terrible about the way the government is treating refugees. So what motivates British liberals? The failure to see a pattern. comment@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2000/jun/17/art","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-17T16:17:00Z","webTitle":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Howlett (1857)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jun/17/art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2000/jun/17/art","fields":{"headline":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Howlett (1857)","bodyText":"· View the work online Artist: Robert Howlett, died 1858, an obscure early photographer whose death, shortly after taking this picture, was said to have been caused by the chemicals he was exposed to in his work. The Illustrated Times praised \"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\". Subject: Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859), the great Victorian engineer who built the Great Western Railway and Bristol's Clifton suspension bridge before spending the last decade of his life on his doomed project, the Great Eastern, a gigantic ocean-going iron steamship. Distinguishing features: Pictured in front of the giant chains of a braking mechanism used in the attempted launch of the Great Eastern from its dry dock at Millwall in 1857 - an event that attracted thousands of paying spectators, who witnessed these chains whip out of control and throw a worker over the crowd to his death - Brunel is a tower of strength. The massive chains, the stovepipe hat, the cigar - can the photographer really not have known what it all signified? The strap across Brunel's waistcoat belongs to the bag full of spare cigars he always carried. But if this is a study of rampant Victorian manhood, it is also about the birth of photography. The negative-positive photograph resulting in non-unique prints was invented by WH Fox Talbot in 1841. By the time this picture was taken, fantastic results were being achieved. Yet so many early photographs are airy-fairy fantasies, with everyone in the garden in fancy dress. The excitement in this picture is that of photography recognising itself. This photograph has no medieval disguises, no precedent in the history of art. It represents the self in a new way - it's as if through all Brunel's butch accessories the photograph is trying to give us a physical experience of the man. The National Portrait Gallery also owns a painting of Brunel from the same year. The painting, by John Callcott Horsley, is a conventional image of the designer at his desk, a represen tation of the intellectual that could have been painted any time since the mid-18th century. This photograph is from a different world. Brunel is not trammelled by tradition. He displays his power to us directly, as he displayed it to the men in the shipyard. It's a likable picture dirty boots and trousers, hands in pockets, barely contained energy. It looks as if Brunel has his eye on some clumsy subordinate. Yet the chains behind are bigger than he is they are his authority but threaten to overwhelm him. These monstrous chains are excessive, sublime. At his feet they vanish into darkness, as if they might be rattling down into hell or are links in an infernal machine. No wonder the Great Eastern was nicknamed Leviathan when it was demolished decades later it was said the skeletons of two labourers were discovered, sealed between its twin hulls. Brunel himself was never as confident as this again. Shortly after posing for this picture he tried to launch the ship, only to find it was stuck in its dry moorings. It took several more tries to get it waterborne. On the eve of the first sailing he had a stroke. The ship was plagued by problems and instead of the world's greatest passenger ship it became a cable-laying vessel. This tale of hubris was forgotten 50 years later in time for Cunard to build the Titanic. Where is it?

It is about identity and belonging. Those of us of Scottish and Anglican extraction, whose families have been a part of this island's history for more than 300 years, regard ourselves as the real British presence in Ireland. For us, our sense of identity and belonging, while rooted geographically in the soil of Ireland, lies politically in our citizenship of the United Kingdom. I see no contradiction in being both Irish and British. My concept of unionism is a union of parts where the diverse peoples of these islands can come together in a common purpose of social advancement. Such a union should enrich and enhance rather than diminish or deny each group its sense of culture, identity and citizenship. The United Kingdom is moving away from the idea of a solitary 'nation' governed by a unitary parliament. Areas such as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands have their own degree of independence. Scotland has its parliament while Wales and Northern Ireland have their assemblies, and England edges closer to regionalisation. Meanwhile, Europe becomes more involved in our daily lives. The United Kingdom of the future will certainly look very different to the United Kingdom of the past. Responsible unionists will acknowledge those differences and commit themselves to a unionism that is progressive. It is important that all citizens of Northern Ireland look to the future and back political structures that will meet the political and social challenges of the new millennium. As a loyalist I welcome the creation of modern, progressive and innovative structures that meet the demands of a changing Northern Ireland within a changing United Kingdom and within a changing Europe. Such structures will also take into account the changing nature of the Republic of Ireland and the development of more agreeable relationships between the governments and the people of both jurisdictions. It is clear, however, that good relationships across these islands will prove ineffective unless they are accompanied by good political relationships within Northern Ireland. A significant number of my fellow citizens aspire to a United Ireland and most identify closely with the political and religious ethos that underpins the Republic. A growing minority of republicans, while aspiring to a United Ireland, do not want to identify with the revisionist politics of post-1916 republicanism or the Catholic ethos that underpins that revisionism. As an Irish Unionist I have no difficulty in endorsing the right of either republican nationalists or republican socialists to seek the achievement of those aspirations through peaceful and democratic means. Thus, while rejecting the political objectives of both Sinn Fein and the SDLP, I welcome the moves by the Sinn Fein leadership to embrace the democratic process. Nationalists and republicans are our fellow citizens and, being a sizeable minority within Northern Ireland, must be represented at executive level. In short, there must be a 'sharing of responsibility' between unionists and nationalists. As a trade unionist whose politics are Labour-oriented I am committed to the politics of commonality, equality, and plurality. The party to which I belong attracts its support from the working-class, the workless class and the underclass. It is my hope that the implementation of the Belfast Agreement will facilitate a radical realignment of political groupings along the lines of issue-based politics. At that stage there will be, I hope, a radical political realignment where those of us who aspire to a genuine social democracy can engage in debate and action on how best we can ensure that the social and economic benefits derived from the new politics will actually reach the people who need them most.

British police and ministers knew Europe's flagship soccer championship would provide a stage for English hooligans to display their savagery. The fixture against the Germans would be a focal point for their efforts. But a parliamentary wrangle verging on farce meant that Britain failed to put enough new legislation on the statute books to stop convicted or suspected hooligans travelling abroad. The tournament started with English soccer thugs able to leave the country - and thus with the chance to get to games in Holland and Belgium where they could cause mayhem. In Germany, the authorities' operations to control hooligans were far more robust, with people merely suspected of involvement in soccer violence being banned from leaving the country. The anti-hooligan drive was founded on one of Germany's biggest surveillance operations of known football thugs, which began two years before a ball was kicked in Euro 2000. Officers monitored gangs' activities, compiling a dossier of their movements and political affiliations. A similar operation was carried out by British police, spearheaded by the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), which liaised with Belgian, Dutch and French forces. But at this point the two countries' approaches diverged. In Germany police efforts were bolstered by special legislation enabling them to confiscate the passports of hooligans they suspected would travel to Euro 2000. The fact it was feared that an individual could cause trouble was enough to take his passport away. Empowered by this law, German officers raiding the homes of several hundred hooligans. As many as 500 had their passports seized. In Britain the power magistrates had to stop thugs from travelling abroad was withering through underuse. By the start of the tournament just 23 international banning orders were in force. In the long leadup to the tournament, the government did not provide any of its own parliamentary time for soccer violence legislation, instead leaving it to be tabled as a private member's bill. The Conservative MP Simon Burns had introduced a bill in the spring of 1999 that would have given British authorities German-style powers to stop hooligans leaving Britain for Euro 2000. The bill tightened the requirements on magistrates courts to impose international banning orders on anyone convicted of a football-related offences. Previous laws passed in 1989 merely asked magistrates to issue restriction orders if they knew it \"would help to prevent violence or disorder\". The Burns bill changed this to \"reasonable grounds to believe that making the order would help to prevent violence or disorder\". In addition, instead of simply being required to report to police stations, hooligans would also be required to hand over their passports at named police stations for five days surrounding overseas matches. Ministers realised new powers were needed when figures showed that by December 1997 there were just nine restriction orders in force, prompting the home secretary, Jack Straw, to write to the courts reminding them of their powers. Mr Burns also planned to widen the scope of his bill, to allow banning orders against people without soccer violence convictions where there were reasonable grounds to suspect they would cause trouble. This plan, supported by the Home Office and NCIS, was spurred by the fact that English hooligans involved in violence during the 1998 World Cup in France had not been put on trial there but were deported. They arrived back in Britain not covered by the terms of the existing banning orders. Though the Tory frontbench supported this tough measure, in the vanguard of opposition were the rightwing Tories Edward Leigh, Eric Forth, Roger Gale and Michael Fabricant. Mr Forth called the idea worthy of the old Soviet Union. \"One of the most fundamental rights of our citizenry over many centuries is that a person who has not been convicted of an offence is regarded as innocent until proven guilty by due process of law,\" he said. The Labour MPs Tom Pendry, Joan Whalley and Peter Pike also raised doubts about the plan, but less vociferously. By May 1999 Mr Burns had decided against tabling the new clause, after it became clear that opponents were willing to kill his whole bill. He thought the government would then pick up the part of his bill that had been scuppered. The then Home Office minister, Kate Hoey, said the government in principle supported the measure. But she later told MPs the idea was premature. \"We clearly have to monitor the effectiveness of the bill - if it is passed - in terms of offences committed and the number of orders,\" she said. \"We need to be in possession of that information before we can further consider the significant new powers proposed in the new clause.\" Weeks before the start of Euro 2000, the fear that not enough had been done to combat English soccer thugs was voiced by Detective Superintendent Brian Drew, head of NCIS's football unit. He accused magistrates of failing to act on their new legal duties. Last month the threat of violence was again brought home when the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen between Arsenal and Galatasaray was marred by clashes. Uefa, organiser of Euro 2000, grew more and more exasperated by Britain's apparent lack of action. Gerhard Aigner, Uefa's chief executive said: \"It is regrettable that the government in the United Kingdom has not introduced legislation which would make it possible to stop registered hooligans from travelling.\" Yesterday, after being attacked by the Conservatives for doing too little, Mr Straw said none of the first 200 people sent back to Britain had convictions for football-related violence or was known to the NCIS's hooligan spotters. England was suffering a \"cultural\" problem which had seen the appeal of drunken thuggery apparently extending beyond the hardcore hooligans to attract people who otherwise led respectable and law-abiding lives, he said. \"We can target those who we know about, but it is much more difficult to target those who have never come to the attention of police in the UK.\" Useful links Euro 2000 Official site Football Unlimited Football Association National Criminal Intelligence Service"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2000/jun/20/educationalbooks.booksforchildrenandteenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-20T00:48:17Z","webTitle":"Outsiders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/jun/20/educationalbooks.booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/jun/20/educationalbooks.booksforchildrenandteenagers","fields":{"headline":"Outsiders","bodyText":"As the media case against asylum seekers gathers pace and is reinforced by vote-catching politics, everyone - especially children - needs to know something much closer to the truth about why people leave their countries and what the reality is when they come here. Anyone trying to understand the complexities of life as a refugee child would do well to turn first to the winner of this year's Bisto Book of the Year Award. Marilyn Taylor's Faraway Home (O'Brien, £4.99) is a tale of Jewish children who came to safety on the Kindertransport after the rise of Hitler. Like the refugee children of today's conflicts, they had to make new friends who understood little or nothing of what they had been through. Based on a true story, it tells how Karl and Rosa adapt to life on a farm set up by the local Jewish community just outside Belfast. Their survival depends on building new trust and keeping hope alive. Beverley Naidoo's The Other Side of Truth (Puffin, £4.99) comes much more from the present day. It tells how Sade and her younger brother Femi see their mother shot dead on the doorstep in Nigeria, the victim of their father's political enemies. With no time to mourn her death, the children are smuggled out of the country. Arriving in London, they are abandoned by their hired courier and left to fend for themselves in a country that is alien in every respect. Helped by foster parents and the refugee services but, above all, by the moral courage inculcated by their parents, the children cope outwardly. Inwardly, however, the emotional toll tells in Femi's retreat into silence. Sade tells the story of the disintegration of her world, a grief that is compounded by the hostile reception from her fellow pupils, ignorant of the upheaval she has been though. In The Girl in Red by Gaye Hicyilmaz (Orion, £4.99) the arrival of a group of Romanian gypsies is greeted with violent abuse by the residents of Poets' Rise. Strange alliances build up between previously warring neighbours as they unite against the newcomers. To Frankie's shock, his mother becomes leader of the bigots, forfeiting her new boyfriend in the process. Frankie sees the Romanians only through his obsession with Emilia, the beautiful girl with the long plaits in a red dress and sandals who arrives in his class speaking no English. Comparing his love with the boundary-crossing of Romeo and Juliet, he takes sides against his mother and allies himself instead with other, more compassionate adults. Gaye Hicyilmaz's adolescent Frankie observes and learns, moved by compassion for an individual that leads him to reject the prejudice that surrounds him. Frankie's view lingers and informs. Like Sade and Femi, Kaninda in Bernard Ashley's Little Soldier (Orchard, £4.99), has seen his family killed. He arrives in England alone, only holding himself together by his secret plans to get back home. Kaninda has been a gun-toting boy-soldier fighting for the rebels in East Africa: he has the scar to show for it. On the estates around his new school in east London he finds tribal warfare of a different kind - less bloody, but every bit as pernicious. Taking sides with Laura, daughter of his adopting family, he is sucked into new friendships, ties that help him to begin a new life. • Children's Book Award 2000 has been won by Michael Morpurgo for Kensuke's Kingdom (Mammoth, £4.99).

To what extent do you feel that this suggests (a) the poor don't have time for civil liberties, so are quite happy to sacrifice them, (b) the poor are more conservative and punitive than the\"'woolly liberals\" you repeatedly affect to despise? Jack Straw: Neither (a) nor (b). You have a remarkably condescending view of my constituents. (I suppose you also think that they wear clogs and shawls, and eat nothing but tripe and onions?) My constituents - well-off, and less well-off - believe very strongly in civil liberties, for the victim and the community, as well as for any accused. Your error is in thinking that defendants alone have civil liberties. By the way, on the subject of woolly liberals, I took the Guardian Unlimited \"woolly liberal\" test, and it turned out that whilst I was not a woolly liberal, I was a liberal after all (but a flaccid one). To add to this reputation for flaccid liberality you should know that I have volunteered this information even before our freedom of information bill is law. Linda45: Why not just legalise all illegal drugs and tax them? Drugs in one form or another have been part of human culture from the beginning. Let's bring in a system similar to the family planning clinics with doctors on hand to offer advice and support to the drug takers. Bring in an age limit of 18 and clamp down hard on those that supply to children. On another point, you will never stop the people of the third world growing these crops - not when the farmer gets $10/kg for wheat, coffee etc and $150/kg for drugs. Then again the third world needs \"trade not aid\". JS: Linda 457, legislation to control drugs has been brought in across the world during this century because of the damage that is done by narcotics. Our system of control is led by science - with different arrangements for control and different penalties according to the classification of the drug. I accept that of course the law does not stop some people consuming narcotics, but legalisation of drugs would, I believe, be bound to lead to a huge increase in consumption and so make a difficult situation much worse. postperson: The conservatives gave us police and community consultative groups, part of the Police Act 1996. Together with the 1995 white paper, 'Tackling Drugs Together', time was the only barrier preventing common sense from emerging. The delayed Police Foundation report is likely to recommend decriminalisation of personal possession. You, the PM and the deputy PM, are together the biggest obstacle preventing a change of law in this country. But public opinion is not with you on the subject of cannabis. JS: postperson, we have built on the drugs strategy of the previous government, not least by the appointment of the UK drugs coordinator (Keith Hallawell), and by additional funds for prisons' drug treatment, and for the new drug treatment and testing order. We are working hard to improve coordination, especially between the NHS and the criminal justice system. I agree: the prime minister, John Prescott and I are obstacles in the way of legalising cannabis, since we do not believe that this is sensible. quux: Words by a certain Mr T Blair on the government proposals for the FoI act: \"This white paper explains our proposals for meeting another key pledge - to legislate for freedom of information, bringing about more open government. The traditional culture of secrecy will only be broken down by giving people in the United Kingdom the legal right to know. This fundamental and vital change in the relationship between government and governed is at the heart of this white paper.\" Can I ask how you could square this with a) Giving yourself power to veto the release of any documents. b) Withholding certain documents for 30 or 75 years before making them available. Why are you attempting to maintain direct (or indeed any) government control over the release of information ? Just what have you got to hide ? JS: Comrade, there is a fundamental flaw in your argument. We are not taking a power in the FoI bill by which ministers can \"veto the release of any document\" (don't believe everything you read in the Guardian.) Under the bill, public authorities will be required by law to release all kinds of documents, and can be ordered to do so by the information commissioner, the tribunal or the courts. It is only where the commissioner, the tribunal or the courts say that there is no duty to release that the authority then has a discretion as to whether to release or not. Even here, the law is tilted in favour of release. robbarnes: Having been a member of the armed forces since 1985, and holding a position now which is considered to be middle management, I would like to ask you how the government feels when it is publicly announced that approximately 30% of junior ranks within the forces are eligible to draw either income support or family credit benefits? Surely a man who is representing the government and the country in the way that we do has the right to a decent wage in order to keep his family. JS: I am sorry that I'm not immediately familiar with the pay structure of the armed forces - but I will pass on your concerns to Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary and ask him to send you a reply. However, I applaud people who serve in the armed forces and can tell you that as a government we are committed to the proper defence of this country. MaxSurvise: If the home secretary realises that there is such furore over Pinochet's extradition, and countries as far as Belgium are vehemently protesting over him being sent home, why does he not feel compelled to review the case? The landmark indictment of the Chadian dictator on Friday was inspired by the Pinochet case. Perhaps Mr Straw could take note and also make history? JS: Of course I understand the strong feelings which people have about this case. However, my duty in this extradition case, as in any other, is to apply the law in the fairest way I can. JS: I'm sorry that I have to go. I've greatly enjoyed this conversation. I'll do my best to reply separately to some of the specific questions asked, but for which I have not had time to answer now.

That was not always the case. Companies used to close their eyes to human rights violations. But in 1980, Mobil Oil withdrew financial support from US public service broadcasting after the film Death of a Princess showed the execution of a 17-year-old Saudi woman on her grandfather's orders. \"Over the last 18 months there seems to have been a change in the willingness of business to engage in human rights issues,\" Mr Frankental said. \"Companies are open to much greater scrutiny than in the past, because of the internet and global media. There is a greater awareness by shareholders of what companies are doing, and more consumer concern,\" he said. About 30,000 Britons work in Saudi Arabia and there are more than 90 UK-Saudi joint venture companies. With a growing, youthful, population and increasing unemployment, the kingdom is keen to encourage foreign investment. Amnesty, which in March published a damning report on human rights practices in Saudi Arabia, argues that violations contribute to social instability and increase the risks affecting investment. Companies which operate in the kingdom are likely to come under scrutiny with regard to the human rights aspects of their operations. In a booklet, Amnesty says: \"Those companies that have an appropriate policy framework in place will be in a strong position to avoid damage to their reputation.\" Several multinationals, including BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell, have already adopted such policies. Amnesty's checklist, which is designed to help companies formulate policies, includes procedures to protect the legal rights of employees, including their right to life; to ensure that the company's products are not used to violate peoples' right to life, liberty or personal security; guidelines to prevent collaboration with enterprises that use unpaid labour, renege on employment contracts or deny employees access to their travel documents and to protect employees' freedom of religion. Foreign Office minister Peter Hain said investors in Saudi Arabia would have the British government's full backing. But he warned that bureaucracy and lack of openness could impede investment. \"There are signs that investors are looking elsewhere. Foreign direct investment in the kingdom has fallen behind that in other markets,\" he said. \"Greater openness will improve mutual understanding, develop common values and increase respect for international standards, in the social , as well as the economic spheres.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/jun/21/guardianleaders","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-21T01:05:48Z","webTitle":"Summit smiles on City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jun/21/guardianleaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jun/21/guardianleaders","fields":{"headline":"Summit smiles on City","bodyText":"Yes it was, as Tony Blair said, something of a triumph for Gordon Brown. He may not wear black tie at the Mansion House, but in his successful battle against the withholding tax on cross-border savings he has proved himself a dear friend of the City of London. He fought hard and, by some accounts, even resisted moves within Whitehall to compromise. Finally, yesterday, the Treasury's recipe became a policy option for the 15. But we must not get carried away. The deal involved nudges and winks about lifting diplomatic sanctions against Austria. It is pretty conditional, too, with a seven-year delay till full implementation. The accord provides for member states to exchange information on financial holdings; but in this \"globalised\" world that can only work if reciprocal arrangements are agreed with non-EU jurisdictions, including Switzerland and eventually the United States. This is potentially a recipe by which progressive government can fight back against tax evasion even in a borderless world. One bonus is ending the cult of bank secrecy - which, among other things, prevented justice for Holocaust survivors for too many years. Yet the Blairite stand would look a lot more coherent if the government's latest statement of proposed rules on taxing offshore corporate accounts were clearer. What happens when Mr Brown's praise of \"tax competition\" is taken literally and companies threaten to vacate the United Kingdom? Step forward Chris Gent of Vodaphone, the man rewarded upfront in telephone numbers for being in the right seat at the right time when the lottery wheel of corporate restructuring turned. While Mr Blair went to Portugal earlier this year in positive mien, brandishing proposals for e-commerce and internet employment, this time he found it hard to avoid Thatcherite \"we bent them to our will\" tones. Perhaps on tax harmonisation, holding out against the odds was justified. But there is a mountain of European business to be done over the next six months that will demand compromise and agreement if enlargement is ever to occur. To get through it the UK will not just have to play honest broker when the French and the Germans dispute, say, imbalance between population and voting strength.

It is the first time the WHO has produced such a league table, which will shame some governments and offend others because of their low ranking and clustering with nations they do not admire. There had been political pressure on the WHO to abandon its radical and ambitious plans to publish the report, but after much soul searching it is understood that the director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland, took the decision a couple of months ago to go ahead and take the flak. The World Health report in previous years has focused on levels of disease, with tables of significant indicators such as life expectancy, fertility and infant mortality in different countries. All the data came from the countries, and was accepted without question, even if there were doubts among officials about the accuracy of the cholera or TB rates. But in the last two to three years, with Dr Brundtland at the helm, the organisation has collected its own figures, made its own analyses and come to its own conclusions. Dr Brundtland believes the WHO should be doing its best to make governments accountable to their people for the health service they provide. \"The main message from this report is that the health and wellbeing of people around the world depend critically on the performance of the health systems that serve them,\" said Dr Brundtland. \"Yet there is wide variation in performance, even among countries with similar levels of income and health expenditure. It is essential for decision-makers to understand the underlying reasons so that system performance, and hence the health of populations, can be improved. \"The difference between a well-performing health system and one that is failing can be measured in death, disability, impoverishment, humiliation and despair,\" she says in the report. \"Dollar for dollar spent on health, many countries are falling short of their performance potential. The result is a large number of preventable deaths and lives stunted by disability. The impact of this failure is born disproportionately by the poor.\" Virtually all countries can do better, says the report, based on estimates for 1997. While the UK does very well in providing healthcare free at the point of access to the entire population, it falls down on inequalities - affluent, middle-class people are more likely to live longer, disease-free lives than those who are worse off. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, was pleased with the UK's ranking. The report \"provides a ringing endorsement of the principles of the NHS - free and fair care for all. The WHO analysis confirms our own analysis of the strengths of the NHS. The report shows we have much to be proud of,\" he said. It also shows, he said, that there is a lot more to do to improve the way the health service responds to the changing needs of the public. \"However, we are not prepared to trade off being fair and free for efficiency and responsiveness to the demands of patients.\" One of the biggest success stories is Oman, placed 8th in the table. In 1970, child mortality was high but government investment has paid off - Oman tops a second table for the way in which expenditure on health succeeds in delivering disease-free life expectancy, above Malta, Italy and France. The UK is 24th; the US 72nd. Money plays a big part in the success of any country in treating its sick, the WHO acknowledges. It suggests that there is a baseline investment of $60 (£39) per head per year, below which healthcare is not going to be adequate. The bottom of the table is dominated by African countries, with war-torn Sierra Leone last. Healthcare systems in some of them are grossly overburdened by Aids. The WHO knows there is little these countries can do to improve their placing, but hopes that donor countries will take note. The WHO freely acknowledges that its league table will not be completely accurate. It compares each country's system to what the experts estimate is the most that could be achieved in that country with the level of resources available. This methodology breaks new ground, but officials believe it is valid and will become more accurate in years to come as better data is accumulated.

At a brownfield site, next to the Marchwood power station on Southampton Water, he brought together major projects in the Marchwood Engineering Laboratories. During the next 16 years, the centre developed an international reputation for power industry research and development. Many projects he initiated are still bearing fruit, others are today's standard engineering installations. Many of the techniques, design codes, instrumentation and machines developed at Marchwood - for welding, nuclear reactor inspection, turbines and other plant - have prolonged the life of Britain's conventional and nuclear power stations, while the large, low-speed wind tunnel, built to study power station emissions, has found customers as far afield as Hong Kong. Born in Enfield, Middlesex, Johnnie took a science degree at London's Northern Polytechnic, while working for the BBC. In 1934, he moved to EMI at Brimsdown, Enfield, to work on the development of the television tube. In 1936, the EMI system was chosen by the BBC for its - and the world's - first public television broadcasts. Meanwhile, electronic engineering efforts were switching towards the first radar early warning systems, with secret \"chain home\" stations being built along Britain's east coast. By 1938, the radar pioneer Robert Watson-Watt had recruited Johnnie into the research station at Bawdsey Manor, near Felixstowe, to work on the new system. Johnnie had to advance his wedding from September 9 to September 2 1939, when the research station was air-lifted to Dundee. He and his wife, Kathleen, spent their honeymoon at Stenigot, on the Lincolnshire wold; he had a radar station to run there too. Eight months later, the headquarters became the Telecommunications Research Establishment, initially based near Swanage, and later in Malvern. In the 1950s, Johnnie joined Vickers-Armstrong, becoming commercial manager of its guided missile division. That experience led to a senior appointment in 1957 with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, whose Risley group, under Sir Christopher (later Lord) Hinton, designed the Magnox series of reactors. As deputy director (overseas), Johnnie was responsible for the Magnox nuclear power stations at Tokai Murai, in Japan, and Latina, in Italy, the only British nuclear power plants that were ever exported. In 1958, Hinton became chairman of the new CEGB, and boosted power industry research 10-fold, for which he brought across Johnnie, initially as a deputy director of research, then, in 1961, as a director. In retirement, Johnnie worked as a consultant for, among others, the British National Oil Corporation. But most of his attention was focused on the Swanage Sailing Club, of which he was commodore from 1973 to 1977. He was known throughout the power industry for his work for the Electrical and Electronics Industries Benevolent Association. Kind, humorous and astute, Johnnie had the capacity to think about people, as well as things. He leaves his wife and two daughters, Jenny and Billie. • Harold Robert 'Johnnie' Johnson, research engineer, born October 8 1913; died May 27 2000"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2000/jun/23/dvdreviews.culture","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-23T01:58:40Z","webTitle":"Video roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jun/23/dvdreviews.culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jun/23/dvdreviews.culture","fields":{"headline":"Video roundup","bodyText":"Complicity Rental and DVD (£19.99) Entertainment in Video Cert 18 *** A typically unflinching tale of sex, drugs and journalism from Iain Banks, whose gripping and sometimes disgusting novel is brought properly to life by veteran director Gavin Millar, best known for TV treats like Cream in My Coffee. Banks's oeuvre would probably have been deemed unfilmable before Trainspotting put heather and whimsy-free Scotland on the screen and, appropriately, Trainspotter Jonny Lee Miller gets the lead role as the lefty firebrand reporter thrown off the crime desk for his over-political reporting style. Even when he is given the safe job of a puff piece on a local brewery, Miller finds that it's being taken over by the Japanese and as a series of rightwing villains start popping their clogs in imaginatively gruesome Banksian ways, our hero becomes chief suspect. Dark and murky deeds are a given with Banks and they get ever more twisted as police chief Brian Cox tries to untangle them and Miller looks ever more guilty. This is like The 39 Steps rewritten from an anarchist-Marxist point of view: \"It's worse than conspiracy. It's complicity.\" Banks fans will be pleased to see that the book's sex scenes (ice cubes and restraints) emerge intact along with his demented plotting.

Foster makes the role implicitly pre-feminist - this being the 1860s - and Chow makes a far less imperious and camp monarch than Brynner. Director Andy Tennant aims for a relatively realistic version and this is as much history lesson as romance with Chow's kingdom threatened by the Burmese, a duplicitous empire - ours of course - and treachery from within. Foster proves she can be at least as convincingly English as Gwyneth Paltrow in this 50s-style epic that is a bit heavy on the sweeping strings and teary-eyed heroism at times. It's an east-west Jane Eyre with a hint of Brief Encounter and feels like it could have been made 20 years before such recent Hollywood easterns as Kundun.

Michael Meacher, the minister who takes the lead on green issues in government, has allowed the move despite his public commitment to switching 25% of rubbish from landfill dumps to recycling by 2005. The minister has also agreed to greatly expand the types of toxic waste which the Isle of Man will be able to export to the mainland. The hazardous waste is to be taken to incinerators in Pontypool, South Wales, and Southampton. The toxic materials are being limited to 60 tonnes each for the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. Mr Meacher said yesterday that he had \"reluctantly\" agreed to the sending of hazardous waste from the Channel Islands, following a deal with the Isle of Man to expand the types of waste that can be sent to Britain because of a lack of suitable facilities for disposal there. Disclosure of the transportation of hazardous waste from the Channel Islands emerged after documents were leaked from the Isle of Man over plans to build a £122m incinerator. A decision on the incinerator was deferred yesterday by the Manx parliament, the Tynwald, after the island's public health department raised environmental and health concerns. The business plan for the new incinerator included plans to export waste to the United Kingdom that had not been agreed with Mr Meacher. This proposal follows a row between the minister and the Isle of Man government over plans to start dumping thousands of tonnes of domestic waste in Britain. In a confidential letter sent by Mr Meacher to David North, Isle of Man trade minister, and obtained by the Guardian, he reveals that the Isle of Man asked to start dumping domestic waste in Britain last year. In 1998 Mr Meacher had agreed to a large increase in the types of hazardous waste which the Isle of Man government could send to the United Kingdom. This agreement tripled from 70 to 205 the number of hazardous waste products which could be dumped in Britain. Among the new products that could be dumped in Britain included arsenic-based wood preservative, diesel oil, crude oil, and methanol. Last December Mr North asked to extend its exports to cover domestic waste, and had a frosty response from Mr Meacher. His officials drafted a letter saying the Manx government could ship waste to the UK so they could recover and recycle some of the products, but \"it was highly unlikely the UK will be able, as a matter of law, to meet your request to accept domestic waste\". This was consistent, it said, with UK policies of encouraging countries to be self-sufficient in the disposal of wastes, as the Isle of Man did not have the facilities to dispose of the waste in question in an environmentally sound manner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jun/24/8","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-24T18:35:09Z","webTitle":"Somewhere in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jun/24/8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jun/24/8","fields":{"headline":"Somewhere in Britain","bodyText":"Centre court The opening of Van Kampen Gardens at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, is marked by a midsummer festival weekend of non-stop music, theatre and children's workshops. • Open Sat 11am-11pm, Sun 11am-5pm.

The ballet gives way to the opera company on Wednesday, after fitting in an extra Monday matinée of Balanchine's Jewels. Then they return for three weeks in August, in programmes worth seeing as often as you can. This is a revitalised company. The dancers look alert and interested, even as bystanders in ballets they know backwards. They are helped by rehearsing in the airy studios of the new Opera House, instead of the cramped, overheated backstage conditions they endured in previous seasons at the Coliseum. Watching them do class in the De Valois studio, I saw them being kept up to speed by Yuri Fateyev, the coach responsible for maintaining the Balanchine repertoire. Mr B required dancers to move faster, be more daring in his choreography. He was intent on extending the dance vocabulary he had inherited from his Maryinsky training before he left Russia for the West. The Kirov have gradually been taking on the ballets in which he re-examined the Petipa technique they know so well. Jewels (made for New York City Ballet in 1967) is their latest acquisition - an American Van Cleef and Arpels concoction transformed into a Fabergé egg. Jewels is a suite of three one-act ballets named after gemstones. Each ballet refers to other, older ballets: Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, Les Sylphides - so see Jewels and you have a précis of the repertoire the company has brought to London. 'Emeralds', to Fauré incidental music, is a homage to romantic love. Chaste ballerinas are pursued by besotted cavaliers, as strands of dryads wind around them in a green glade. It is the most elusive of the three ballets to bring off, for so much of it is based on simple walking. While the women drift weightlessly on point, the men, as one of the original American cast explained to me, should move as deftly as Fred Astaire: totally wrapped up in their partners and the music, responding naturally. The Kirov's young pretenders are still stepping out like princes. The leading man in 'Rubies' is street-wise Gene Kelly rather than elegant Astaire. Viacheslav Samodurov interprets him as a jester, teasing the girl (Diana Vishneva) he is never likely to get. Vishneva relishes the game, flashing a smile as brilliant as her virtuoso beats and battements. She is cut out to be a bold Balanchine dancer, raring to go, while Maya Dumchenko in the other Ruby role is a darker gem, retaining her mystery. 'Diamonds' displays the polished facets of Uliana Lopatkina, who has matured into a ballerina of expressive depth. With Igor Zelensky as a jewel of a partner, she brings all Petipa's vision scenes, including Swan Lake Act II, in her train as the queen of diamonds. The corps, in ice-white tutus, follow her lead, transforming what can seem a paste finale into the real thing. Lopatkina seems to have a direct line to another world. She has insights into Nikiya's kingdom of the shades and Odette's sinister lake beyond the reach of the Kirov's up and coming dancers. Veronika Part was a gorgeous Swan Queen without a story to tell. Svetlana Zakharova on Thursday revealed more of Odette's secrets: hyper-supple, she makes the same extravagant swan shapes as Sylvie Guillem but lacks Guillem's core of control. Meanwhile, in the Linbury Studio basement, the Royal Ballet is performing modern works at bargain prices. Unsatisfied ticket holders were slipping into the last act of Swan Lake to catch the Kirov corps. You can't keep a good balletomane down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jun/25/uk.charleskennedy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-24T23:15:08Z","webTitle":"Kennedy and the F word","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jun/25/uk.charleskennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jun/25/uk.charleskennedy","fields":{"headline":"Kennedy and the F word","bodyText":"The appearance of Charles Kennedy on Question Time last week was on the whole impressive. He started uncertainly, parrying questions on economic migrants and scanning the audience like some night-club owner on the lookout for troublemakers. Gone is the easy manner of the old Kennedy, broadcaster, bon viveur and wit. Now we have the homme sérieux, husky voiced and earnest. He dealt skilfully with the planted Tory europhobes who want to pin their party's destiny to the pound, but I was struck by the fact that when he turned to the West Lothian question he managed to advance his party's solution - federalism across the UK - without once mentioning the f-word, which has been used so freely by the Tory press in its demonisation of all things European, even though, as Kennedy pointed out, it means less rather than more centralism. In the old debates about devolution, those who argued that it would not lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom used to make two assumptions. The first was that Westminster would not punish and isolate Scotland by cutting public expenditure north of the border; the second was that both the Tory and Labour parties would continue to be committed to the United Kingdom as our dominant constitutional entity. Both propositions still largely hold true but are fraying at the edges. Last week Lord Barnett himself renounced the formula for sharing out public expenditure named after him. In the English regions a head of steam is building up to remove some of Scotland's cash and give it to places like the North East which appear to have fared badly by comparison. John Prescott skilfully evaded the point when questioned about it on Radio 4's Today, preferring to emphasise the work of the relatively new English regional development agencies. But he did indicate that he thought the correct response to any disparity was to level up rather than down. In any case, the Barnett Formula should over the coming years shave off some of Scotland's relative advantage. But on the Tory side there seems to be less sagacity and statecraft, on this and other questions. What was not foreseen in the Seventies was how the party would change through the Thatcher era. Its support in Scotland was heavily eroded. The European question, and the eclipse of the party's Europhile wing, has hastened its mutation into an English National Party. Old-fashioned one-nation Conservatives are in a distinct minority. The Scottish Tories are struggling, with some difficulty, to find a place in this new world, wrapping themselves in the Saltire rather than the Union Jack. But one feature of the new landscape in England is a tone of virulent resentment and dislike of Scotland and its perceived constitutional and fiscal advantages. These voices are still fairly subdued but they are increasingly making themselves heard, not just among Tories from the shires but among policy-makers and intellectuals. What was certainly not foreseen was that the West Lothian question would first raise its head in the coming Commons debate on fox-hunting. Tam Dalyell is denying himself a vote but few other Scottish MPs are following his example. As Kennedy told his audience, they have no obligation to remain silent on any issue that comes before the UK parliament to which they were elected even though the outcome affects only England. After all, Scotland lived through a long period under Thatcher when the reverse was true, the period in which poll tax was first tried on the dog and when Scottish committees at Westminster were packed with English Tories. What Kennedy could have added, but circumspectly did not, is that until they embrace federalism - with an elected Senate and even an elected president - the English should really shut up about the West Lothian question. The solution is staring them in the face but they are too stubborn, or too committed to their own totems, to see it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jun/25/observerescapesection11","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-25T18:45:35Z","webTitle":"City of the sea builds on its buccaneering past","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jun/25/observerescapesection11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jun/25/observerescapesection11","fields":{"headline":"City of the sea builds on its buccaneering past","bodyText":"'For people, not posers,' says the sign over the door to the health club on the quayside. It could serve as a motto for the whole city, for this is Bristol, a town built for real working people from the proceeds of their labour in its port. But what does a city do when the reason for its very existence has literally sailed away? Handsome Bristol's docks have long been silent, but a buccaneering spirit still lurks there down by the water, playing its part in the city's renaissance. Looking out from Cabot's Tower high above the city centre, a huge roofscape lies below, the river twisting through it like a silver-grey eel. Great ships no longer unload their cargoes here, but the quaysides are far from derelict. Like London and Liverpool, the waterfront is revitalised with bars, internet cafés, floating restaurants, bookshops, galleries and health clubs. This is a city of constant variety; ancient buildings set against, for the most part, imaginative, modern civic development - the new Broad Quay water feature, for instance (all fountains, weirs, masts and rigging), reminding Bristolians of their city's former reliance on the sea. And some great civic disasters are being set right. Queen Square, crammed with beautiful Georgian houses, had a dual carriageway driven through it by a Sixties planner, but now it is being returned to its former splendour, the road ripped up and grass replacing tarmac. An astonishing £450 million is being spent on redeveloping a harbourside area to the west of the city centre towards the Anglican cathedral. Called @Bristol, it aims to entertain with a mix of nature, science and art. Explore @Bristol, due to open on 6 July, will show how science and technology affect our lives. Wildscreen @Bristol, opening on 20 July, will focus on the diversity of the natural world with a walk-through botanical house filled with live butterflies and birds and the only Imax cinema in the South-West: an appropriate attraction in a city that is home to the world-famous BBC Wildlife Unit. A planetarium - a giant silver sphere called Imaginarium - is also under construction. So Bristol is looking forward to the future with confidence, but its past is equally fascinating. The money that poured in off the dockside was ploughed into fine houses and great churches; St Mary Redcliffe, for instance, is a massive perpendicular gem, far richer than the bigger cathedral across the water and considered one of the finest churches in the world. Clifton must be one of England's most beautiful suburbs. Once a village, it became a highly desirable address in the late eighteenth century when richer Bristolians built fine houses on Clifton Down, up above the noise and bustle of the quayside. It's really rewarding to stroll around. Grand terraces with balconies of decorated wrought iron overlook open green spaces, the dramatic Avon Gorge and the city's best-known icon, the Clifton Suspension Bridge by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Victorian engineer who built the Great Western Railway, Temple Meads station and the SS Great Britain, the largest ship of her day, now lying in her original dry dock in the harbour below. It's difficult to believe, but ships once carried their cargoes right to the door of Bristol's new Hotel du Vin, an imaginative conversion of a series of city-centre warehouses. Mr Reed's Sugar House was built in 1728 when the River Frome flowed past its front door and the hotel's windows, which today overlook the city's central hub, would have looked out on to a sea of masts and rigging. Sugar and tobacco flowed in to Bristol from the Caribbean. Manufactured goods went to Africa and were swapped for slaves for the Caribbean plantations. When the sugar trade ended, the warehouse moved on to tobacco and eventually birdseed, before lying empty for 11 years. In 1906 its owner put a fine Queen Anne-style façade on its front, and it is that part of the building that now serves as the hotel's bistro. As its name implies, the Hotel du Vin is serious about its wine list, as are its sister establishments in Winchester and Tunbridge Wells, but equally impressive are the imaginative menus from head chef Eddie Gray. A sweeping modern staircase leads up to the 40 loft-style bedrooms retaining massive wooden beams and iron pillars. The ships may have sailed, but Bristol retains its air of a city wedded to the sea. Tucked behind Queen Square is a row of eighteenth-century sailors' almshouses that still bear this inscription: Freed from all storms, the tempest and the rage of billows Here we spend our age. Our weatherbeaten vessels here repair And from the merchant's kind and generous care, find habitation here; No more we put to sea until we launch into Eternity. And lest our widows, whom we leave behind, should want relief They too a shelter find. Thus all our anxious cares and sorrows cease Whilst our kind guardians turn our toils to ease. May they be with an endless Sabbath blest Who have afforded unto us this rest. Factfile @bristol Opening next month.

Vintage, 320 pp., £7.99, 4 May, 0 099 28269 0 Buy it at BOL When Allen Ginsberg's Beat vision-quest came through England in the spring of 1965, I was appointed by this famous renegade minstrel to set down his legend for the Paris Review. Ginsberg's last words in our interview came in response to an inquiry about the role of command in the compositional process. Sometimes when he was at work on his poems, he declared radiantly, he was overcome by \"a sense of being self-prophetic master of the universe.\" That empowering sense, a feeling that he had a special mission, \"an immediate Messianic thing\" involving \"movements of history and breaking down the civilisation,\" had originated nearly two decades earlier, Ginsberg confided, in an auditory hallucination of William Blake intoning 'Ah, Sunflower' to him \"like God had a human voice'.\" James Campbell, who introduces a note of irony into his reworking of twice-told Beat tales, refers to Ginsberg's historic undergraduate illumination as \"hand-held\" - perhaps an allusion to a key detail in what he had said to me: the fact that an act of masturbation had triggered Blake's phantasmal arrival in his East Harlem tenement flat. This account of the revelatory plunge into Godhead (\"the ceremony of his election\"), often cited over the years as Beat Scripture, is quoted at length again here, ending with the poet's optimistic verdict as to its meaning for his future life: \"The spirit of the universe was what I was born to realise.\" Campbell's tour of Beat legend begins with his subjects' youthful exploration of criminal behaviour and moves on through many picaresque adventures, battles with psychic monsters, tiltings against windmills (normality is most often the enemy), pointless side-trips into illusory discoveries and confused rhizomatic intertanglings of relation and motive. He also shows how Ginsberg's quest led him back to the original Blakean delusion of grandeur. Throughout this underground romance, that first infusion of 'divine inspiration' remains for Ginsberg what opiates are for his fellow Beat quester, William Burroughs: a way of attaining to 'vision'. But Ginsberg's heroic mission includes something else as well: an implicit claim to the Beat throne. And more: \"I am high and naked,\" this indomitable Ecdysiac Knight exclaims, splashing into the 1960s on the last page of Campbell's hard-eyed reconstruction of the legend, \"and I am King of the Universe.\" When we met in England, Ginsberg had abdicated another impromptu throne, as King of the May (Kral Majales) in Prague. He had been expelled for taking off his clothes during a reading to his student subjects. Further prophetic challenges lay in store. We went on a pilgrimage to Glastonbury. There, after pausing under the great conical chimney of the abbey kitchen to scribble notes on the display of chivalric devices, arms and armour, he stood in the chilly drizzle over what was said to be the grave of King Arthur and chanted an extended, improvised rabbinical-druidic hymn. It evoked the strength and innocence of Blake's Albion and ended on what seemed to me, at the time, a strange remark, perhaps a challenge hurled from king to king: \"British poets are cowardly!\" Most legends have variants. The Arthurian story locates the mythic King's remains not at Glastonbury but in fabulous Avalon. Campbell puzzles out the meanings of legendary Beat episodes by offering alternative readings: providing, for example, ten different descriptions of the object that Burroughs was aiming at when he shot his wife in the head in Mexico (champagne glass, shot glass, highball glass, wine glass, gin glass, water glass, tin can, apple, apricot, grape), and six possibilities for the kind of paper on which Jack Kerouac typed out the original hundred-foot scroll of On the Road (teletype paper, Japanese drawing paper, oilskin art paper, shelf-paper, canister paper, tracing paper). He finds strands of Kerouac's road romance throughout the Beat legend. Tangled up in the story, as usual, is the Beat Lancelot, Neal Cassady. \"The new American hero . . . delinquent and hungry for a purpose\", Cassady shows up here in 1947, a beguiling apparition, naked with an erection in a tenement doorway, waiting to be \"miraculously-crafted\" into a figure of romance. For Kerouac, who had been blocking out a grand picaresque novel in his notebooks, an American Pilgrim's Progress, this naked stranger held \"the keys to America\", a kingdom whose magic had until this moment been withheld from him. Kerouac \"glimpsed the possibility of romance.\" There was \"something mystical . . . which, in a shaft of insight akin to a vision, he recognised in Cassady,\" Campbell writes. Kerouac's association with Cassady jump-starts what Campbell calls \"the process of a profound change in his attitude towards his own experience.\" The change was a matter of learning how to blow up real events and people to mythic proportions. It was Cassady who taught him this: the tearaway adventurer who stole cars and carried off women at a dizzying pace appeared to be more than human. The poetic tropes with which Kerouac limned his new-generation hero were often derived from classical mythology, with Cassady cast as a Promethean stealer of automotive fire, chained to his own inarticulate drives as one bound to a rock; a winged-messenger god in a Mercury; a naked Eros. In Campbell's account of the legend, the last of these figures is rampant. Cassady appears here under the double aspect of danger and desire. The importance of his role, allowing the spectator Kerouac to escape to the position of vicarious participant in his adventures, grows clearer as these adventures become more risky and the romance thickens, muddied by the growing extent of the depravity of the 'errant boy'. Inevitably, in this as in many other versions, we suspect that Cassady's place in the legend may be that of the sacrificial hero, the fated victim of his own terrifying quest for kicks. Being a witness to vision is less blinding than experiencing it, and Kerouac realises with relief that he will not have to put himself at the centre of his romance. Riding shotgun on great road trips will reveal his own ritual aspect, the Brooding Sidekick to Cassady's hyperactive, beguiling Knight Driven and Driver. Even before taking off, Kerouac is excited by a \"reflected witchery\" he feels sure will signal a new leap in his own vision-quest. \"And somewhere along the way,\" he writes at the start of On the Road, \"I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\" Yet Cassady's reflected witchery turns out to be complex: the legendary cocksman is disclosed as an androgynous beguiler in a subplot that entangles him at once with Kerouac and Ginsberg. Campbell plays this as an episode of double desire, in which Lancelot becomes Guinevere. Balancing between \"the desire to please and the desire to profit\" by \"making an investment in Ginsberg's literary talent\", Cassady reveals his mendacious aspect as the Hustler Knight, \"only bestowing favours because he wants to gain something by the transaction.\" The 'investment' in physical attentions will return a certain dividend in Howl (\"N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver\"), but the real score is reserved for Kerouac. Campbell points to a passage in the 1950 scroll draft of the road romance, which left the Beat heroes' real names undisguised, and shows Kerouac seeking to appropriate the naked hero, now a bone of contention, for his own uses: \"Allen was queer . . . and Neal saw this and a former hustler himself . . . and wanting dearly to learn how to write poetry like Allen, the first thing he was attacking Allen with a great amorous soul such as only a conman can have.\" Campbell suggests that Kerouac's biased account of the three men's interlocking relations in On the Road is intended to point up the hollowness of the Hustler Knight's love for Ginsberg, and that this, in turn, \"creates a space for the true romance of the book\". He is particularly good on the way that \"true romance\" is clinched in the symbolic wedding scene. In this blushing, embarrassed bonding episode, which joins the narrator and his 'errant-boy' hero in a golden, illuminated moment on a sunlit hill, exchanging glances above the Western ocean, we are reminded again that in romance, accidents often turn up clues to the hidden intent of a quest. The scene is precipitated by a 'realistic' narrative contingency - the outlaw hero getting bounced (for infidelity) by his 'reigning wife' - but it allows a marvellous revelation of the secret goal. \"There were triumph and insolence in his eyes,\" Kerouac's narrator says, as the two heroes stand marooned in their Beatness on that sunlit hill, \"a devilish look, and he never took his eyes off mine for a long time. I looked back and blushed . . . we would stick together and be buddies till we died.\" Spelling out the significance of this for the legend, Campbell notes that \"theirs is a platonic love, though bedecked by romantic accoutrements, many of them subliminal, some even unconscious.\" His analysis of the symbolic 'wedding' is central to his account of Beat legend: the scene appears as the ultimate consummation of a sublimated 'boy-gang' love which has not yet adjusted to its later exchange value. The love between the two figures who, as Campbell comments, \"possess nothing but their baggage and each other\", is naive, deceived and self-deceiving, yet as long as the spell of the road romance lasts, it is untainted by the element of commodification which Cassady's hustler habits introduce into the legend. Had the road book stayed in Kerouac's backpack for ever, there might have been no cancelled cheques with his autograph for Johnny Depp to buy. But not all sacraments are destined to remain sacred. Given the current commercial success of everything to do with the Beats, it is ironic and curious to recall the resistance that Kerouac - the first, most committed and poetic of the Beat chroniclers - encountered when he began looking for a publisher for the 1950 typescript of On the Road. Campbell retells the story of this seven-year trial of rejection and suspicion, during which Kerouac's bitterness intensifies with the pitfalls and pratfalls of the quest, some of them bizarre, even grotesquely comic - Kerouac being ineptly agented by Ginsberg, and nightmarishly 'edited' by Carl Solomon, the insulin-comatose, glucose-swollen Bughouse Knight of Howl. Kerouac's comments in letters of the period paint an unfunny self-portrait of a gullible 'Li'l Abner' at the mercy of the rapacious commercial 'pigjaws' of Madison Avenue. There is also paranoia about having his creation whisked away, exploited and cashed in on by fellow writers. But paranoia, in his friend Burroughs's formulation, is only extreme consciousness: an enhanced receptivity to truth. It was around this point that John Clellon Holmes, a stay-at-home quester, purloined testimony from Kerouac and Ginsberg for a pelf-garnering pseudo-Beat romance (Go!), and, in a notorious article in the New York Times ('This Is the Beat Generation'), took metonymic possession of Kerouac's ritual term for the underworld heroes' \"new stance toward reality\" - \"a sort of furtiveness . . . a kind of beatness\", as Kerouac had explained it to him. \"I guess you could say we're a beat generation.\" Kerouac's belated effort to grab back the term's ritual magic by retitling his road-book The Beat Generation proved futile. The unparagraphed format of the 1950 hundred-foot scroll typescript clearly worked against its commercial prospects, and the recalcitrant Kerouac finally gave in and broke up the long heroic prose into more conventional units. A related but more serious difficulty was his disinclination to compromise the manner of his writing. On-the Road's headlong, scattered drafting of a collective but disorganised vision-quest, a romance of errantry with no point but the journey itself and \"no story beyond the story posted by the signs along the way\", inevitably set Kerouac at loggerheads with Malcolm Cowley, the first editor to recognise the mythic potential of his legend. Cowley, seen through the Brooding Knight's cocked eye as \"a semi-pedantic Vermont professor-type with a hearing aid\", made gentle but firm demands for a conventional structure - a \"unified story\", an 'A-B-C development' - which Kerouac stubbornly refused to accommodate. His book's construction, he insisted, was consistent with his road vision - a claim for the truth of allegorical romance. As Campbell says, this dispute agonisingly lingered; entire centrifugal movements were required to be cut; it was in desperation that Kerouac at last submitted to the sacrilege of revision which allowed On the Road to see the light. In This Is the Beat Generation, Campbell himself works with a romance-narrative mode of entrelacement; his reconstruction of Beat legend moves forward by jumping from limb to limb of a branch-narrative structure, following his several heroes' interconnected movements from chapter to chapter. Their quest is anti-normative, anti-conventional from the start. Like Malory's heroes, they are bound to a peculiar way of living, characterised by a restless search for new adventure. Malory's knights, after all, are not only courtly but crazy and confused; Caxton's preface warns readers that they will find not only deeds brave and chivalrous, but 'cowardyse, murdre, hate'. The young knights in search of a 'New Vision' whom Campbell discovers in wartime New York City - Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Lucien Carr - all land in mental hospitals by the-age of 30. The loyal boy-gang that develops out of their errant undergraduate 'libertine circle' undergoes some of its severest tests in these early chapters, as their New Vision implicates them in a succession of legendary crimes of impulse, rehearsed by Campbell with something like tabloid relish. They include murder (Carr's \"honour slaying\" of his ex-scoutmaster, David Kammerer, with Burroughs and Kerouac as accessories); needle-drug addiction (\"quite a sensation\" is Burroughs's comment on being administered his first shot of morphine by Herbert Huncke); and self-mutilation (Burroughs's prescient deconstructive act, or \"Van Gogh kick\", of snipping off his left little finger with poultry shears). Irrationality is etched as deeply into Beat legend as the skull-and-crossbones Ginsberg inscribes beneath the words 'Fuck the Jews' in the dust of his college dormitory windowsill, earning him a brief expulsion from Columbia. The same sepulchral motif would come to figure as his calling-card. At King's College, Cambridge, in our 1965 spring tour, he scribbled it on a cheerful self-introductory note thrust under E.M. Forster's door. Forster later inquired: \"Is the fellow mad?\" When Ginsberg heard this, he thought it was flattering. In Howl, we recall, it is precisely the madness of the Beat generation's 'best minds' - \"starving hysterical naked\" - that leads them to vision. By the mid-1950s the Beat quest had carried its principal heroes to the fabulous western edge of the kingdom. In sunny California Allen Ginsberg's long camouflage trail of half-hearted 'normalcy programs' is finally lost in the hang-up-dispelling daylight of psychotherapy, allowing him to leap from a repressed state - \"the blind side of the trick wall\", Campbell calls it - out into the full illumination of his ceremonial aspect as the Ecdysiac Knight. To \"express secret life in whatever form it comes out,\" he confided to a group of students, \"I practically take my clothes off.\" At a famous gathering of minstrels in the Six Gallery, in San Francisco, Howl was covered with glory. For the first time in the Beat legend, private weirdness was publicly embraced. Kerouac the Brooding Knight succeeds less well in this West Coast phase of the legend. All along impatient with his \"flighty vagabond romanticism\", his latent racism and misogyny, Campbell now reveals him in his later Simple Simon aspect, as a faux-naif \"crazy dumbsaint\" Knight of Oblivion. The Kerouac of the later parts of Campbell's version is all but finished as a writer, even before his central work has been published: a foolish, besotted, lost hero \"to whom thoughts brought trouble, who drank to quell them\". Lonesome and bereft after the failed love affair with a black girl chronicled in The Subterraneans - condemned by Campbell as the most reprehensible of Beat texts - he turns to the Life of Buddha to relieve his 'Beermares', but after much untutored study rises only to the \"fatalistic and commonplace\" in his attempts to smuggle an adopted religion into his writing. Heading to California, he backpacks with Zen companions Philip Whalen and Gary Snyder, but only gets drunker and lonelier and unhappier. When last we see him, he is typing-up grandiose autodidactic meditation manuals and \"spiritual bromide\" sutras in a rustic cabin in thought-free California, victim of a fear of \"discriminating thinking\" that cloaks \"a banal fear of life\". The last word on Kerouacian/West Coast Beat Buddhism, here, is reserved for the exiled Invisible Knight, William Burroughs, responding from his 'end-of-the-world' outpost in Tangiers to his friend Kerouac's babblings about renunciation, self-abnegation and chastity: \"Buddhism is only for the West to study as history . . . It is not, for the West, An Answer, not A Solution. We must learn by acting, experiencing and living; that is, above all, by Love and by Suffering . . . You were given the power to love in order to use it, no matter what pain it may cause you. Buddhism frequently amounts to a form of psychic junk . . . What I mean is the Californian Buddhists are trying to sit on the sidelines and there are no sidelines. Whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavour.\" The deadpan, laconic, no-nonsense noir voice of experience that makes Burroughs Campbell's true Beat oracle, at once its trustiest commentator and in some sense its stylistic model, also supplies some of the book's driest lines. Confronted by an 'Ugly Spirit' while shooting his wife in Mexico City, for instance, he reports that it was, in retrospect, as if her brain \"drew the bullet toward it\". Campbell, clearly impressed, places Burroughs among the \"untouchables\" of legend, those who perform a \"priestly function in taking on themselves all human vileness\". Our last glimpse of this frail, greyish creature of the shadows discovers him in Paris at the outset of the 1960s, the truest of Campbell's Beat survivors, still tuned into that old \"silent frequency of junk\" and still enacting the oldest and deepest of Beat rituals - transgression and self-mutilation - and turning them now against the legend itself. Taking a cut-up lance to his own writings as \"the next logical step in his continuing quest for the secret of telepathic communication\" - \"If you cut into the present, the future leaks out\" - the Invisible Knight finds the Word itself coming apart under his surgical blade. At the end of this demystifying book, Campbell stresses the fundamental difference between Burroughs's approach to the vision-quest and Ginsberg's. Burroughs wanted to eradicate his own identity; Ginsberg wanted to incorporate everything in his. • To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

For the United Kingdom, which already has a race relations statutes, the directive will still provoke major reforms. In an EU where most countries have no compre hensive race legislation, the new directive enforces the principle of equal treatment irrespective of ethnic origin. European involvement in this area is based on article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty of June 1997, allowing \"appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation\". The directive outlaws both direct and indirect discrimination. Practices that are apparently neutral but disadvantage those of a particular ethnic origin will be banned. Incitement to discriminate is to be treated as equivalent to actual discrimination. EU members will be obliged to ensure that their domestic law complies. Statutes must be put in place that ensure equal treatment in both public and private sectors, including social security and health, as well as in the sup ply of goods and services, such as housing. One aspect of the directive has attracted particular controversy. This is the \"burden of proof\" requirement: if an individual establishes that racial discrimination has taken place, it will be for the alleged discriminator to disprove this. Business in the UK has expressed concern that this may increase the number of cases brought. Some claim that it will make for a \"complainants' charter\". Yet this change in the burden of proof is needed. Often the evidence in such cases is held by the alleged discriminator alone, perhaps in personnel files. EU countries have already agreed parallel changes in the burden of proof in cases of gender discrimination, to be implemented by July 2001. The directive's aim is not that all EU states have the same anti-discriminatory instruments. It is rather to guarantee a minimum stan dard of treatment. National race relations bodies along the lines of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), will be charged with monitoring and supporting the measure. Governments will have to report on how the directive is being applied and include the opinions of voluntary bodies working in the race area. The effect of the equal treatment directive will vary from country to country. The Race Relations Act here already includes many of the required provisions. But the CRE reckons harassment and indirect discrimination will have been redefined in law. The scope of the act will have to be extended to protect access to jobs and involvement in workplace organisations. The race bill now before parliament is extending the scope of the CRE to cover prisons and the police, perhaps even the immigration service as well. (The chart is a reminder of one aspect of the race equality agenda in the UK - the big increase is partly a result of more effective measurement of racial incidents by the police.) The directive means there will be further changes in the law, for example to allow organisations to bring proceedings on behalf of individual complainants. Even more dramatic will be the directive's impact on other countries. In Germany the constitution can be invoked by individuals in court cases alleging discrimination, but there is no specific race legislation. The French constitution and civil and labour codes mention race. Politicians have been discussing new anti-discrimination proposals; the directive now gives them a comprehensive framework. Austria, the focus of debate in recent months after the far-right Freedom party led by Jörg Haider became a partner in the ruling coalition (Mr Haider having since stood down), has no general anti-discrimination law and its constitution has no reference to \"race\". It is a measure of the importance of the directive that the government, Freedom party included, will have to implement a race relations act. The EU's southern members are interesting, too. The Portuguese, who during their presidency of the EU have been leading the debate, have no constitutional provision on race, though Portuguese labour law prohibits dismissal on grounds of race or ethnic origin. Portugal's institutional architecture includes the office of high commissioner for immigration and ethnic minorities. The constitution of Greece states that all Greeks are equal before the law, but civil and labour law entirely omit any protection against discrimination on the grounds of race. Netherlands law offers a comprehensive framework around equal opportunities and race and probably comes closest among EU members to the UK. The Dutch 1994 Equal Treatment Act explicitly mentions race, nationality and race discrimination - yet even the Netherlands will not be immune from the directive's effects. There is no doubt that buried in the various European constitutions there are commitments to equal treatment, but they are vague and inexplicit. The new directive will bring consistency to the way all EU citizens are treated, whatever their race or origin.

For those of us on the lookout for the unfamiliar in art, it's not quite so exciting. Kingdom of the Soul: German Symbolist Art 1870-1920 covers a period that produced Nietzche, Rilke, Wagner and Mahler. The only artists here who come near their intensity are those we already know about: Max Klinger, Franz von Stuck and (Swiss-born) Arnold Böcklin. The rest show that German artists were just as capable of fanciful escapism as the many mediocre artists of Victorian Britain. The plethora of bronze nudes is numbing, while in the studio the artists become transfixed by their own furrowed-brow glare in the mirror of self-reflection. Oskar Zwintscher fancies himself posed with brush and palette in hand, elevated and seemingly alone in his garret. A skeleton reaches in through the window and deposits an hourglass in front of him. It's a great pity that such kitsch distracts from the truly imaginative images here. Klinger and von Stuck at their best were dreamers whom we can now recognise as worthy precursors of Max Ernst and Francis Bacon. Von Stuck's crow-winged Lucifer pierces the viewer with sci-fi eyes, while a crescent moon plummets out of the sky. Women for von Stuck may be a predictable cast of femmes fatales, but his brush at least conveys a masochistic passion for every last one of them. The Klingers convince with their inventive brand of awkwardness. A wild-eyed boy, surely a fellow-spirit of Lautréamont's Les Chants de Maldoror, rides a shark across a wind-blown sea. Then you turn a corner and see Böcklin's Prometheus. Forget the daft giant lolling around on the mountain top, and look at the way Böcklin's paint has got into the spirit of those trees. In a show with so much lofty symbolism, it's perhaps significant that the high point comes in a beautifully painted passage of down-to-earth trees. • Kingdom of the Soul is at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (0121-303 1966), till July 30."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/2000/jul/01/transport.world","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-01T00:39:48Z","webTitle":"£200m office tower and concourse planned for Paddington station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/01/transport.world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jul/01/transport.world","fields":{"headline":"£200m office tower and concourse planned for Paddington station","bodyText":"Railtrack is planning a £200m redevelopment of Paddington station in west London, including a huge office tower sprouting through an enormous passenger concourse. The plans, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, architects of the Eurostar international terminal at Waterloo, were submitted to Westminster city council yesterday. English Heritage is expected to object to the plans, not because of the height of the lattice-like tower - 194 metres (637ft) - but because its new chairman, Sir Neil Cossons, may oppose the proposal to demolish part of the existing station. Sir Neil, former director of the Science Museum, is campaigning for the entire original Great Western railway as devised by Brunel to be nominated as a world heritage site. The Victorian station trainshed was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1852-54 and fronted by the Italianate-style Great Western Hotel by Matthew Digby Wyatt in 1868-74. Although a brilliant and elegant engineering design, with its roots clearly in Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace of 1851, Brunel's greenhouse-like trainshed has always felt hidden away, claustrophobic, and even a little mysterious. The Victorian painter William Powell Frith caught this atmosphere beautifully in The Railway Station (1862), as did Arthur Conan Doyle several times in his Sherlock Holmes stories. Paddington Bear was found here by the Brown family. In Jagger's haunting statue, a first world war Tommy still reads a letter from home on platform one. Railtrack plans to bring space, light and commercialism into Paddington by demolishing the 1916 eastern extension. Instead of this dark trainshed, there would be new platforms and a 300 metre long, 21 metre high concourse raised on tree-like columns and opening up to the Regent's canal. The architect, Nicholas Grimshaw, a noted fan of Brunel, has already completed The Lawn, a shopping-mall style concourse at the southern end of the platforms. This was opened last year to coincide, a little late, with the arrival of the 15-minute Heathrow Express service. It is bright and cheery, although, as with all new station buildings, it feels more like an airport than a railway building. Railtrack hopes the new design will also sort out the byzantine road network that throttles traffic to and from the station - notably taxis - and that it will act as a commercial balance to the new Paddington Basin development, acres of shiny Canary Wharf-style offices and shops, crowned with a skyscraper designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jul/01/dresden.germany.shortbreaks","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-01T18:01:30Z","webTitle":"Gilt trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jul/01/dresden.germany.shortbreaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jul/01/dresden.germany.shortbreaks","fields":{"headline":"Gilt trip","bodyText":"The statue of Augustus the Strong is resplendent in a new coat of gold leaf. The clattering trams crossing the River Elbe are also in new livery. The royal palace with its fine stucco work is surrounded by diggers and piles of sand. The city council is particularly keen to promote a golden age that was probably only gilt-edged for some, and concrete over as quickly as possible the city's communist inheritance. By 2006, the city's 800th anniversary, the building sites will have gone, along with any trace of the past 60-odd years. Dresden was at the western reaches of the Iron Curtain and is now at the eastern end of fortress Europe. It has skipped, apparently effortlessly, from one side to the other of one of the best defended borders in the world. It is selling itself as Florence on the Elbe, but such a comparison is unhelpful. Bestriding the fast flowing river, it has its own charm though it is too laid-back, too muted to be Italian. In the old town, Baroque architecture dominates, but there is also modern art, parks and forests, an off-beat social life and, if you know where to look, the tell-tale signs of the former East Germany. The Frauenkirche is a potent symbol of what is happening to the city. Almost completely destroyed by the allied bombing in 1944, the ruins were left as a charred memorial to those who died (estimated to be at least 35,000 people). These days, it resembles a modern-art installation, encased as it is in scaffolding, but soon it will rise like a phoenix from the cold war ashes. A memorial once again, this time to reconciliation. A manageable walk from here, along mainly pedestrian-only routes, offers enough Baroque splendour for even the most voracious of appetites, from the Royal mews, to the Semper Opera House and the Swinger Palace. (The tourist office has a map in English that details this walk.) Each is a splendid building in sandstone with bronze and gilded turrets and cupolas. At the Swinger you will also find gardens, the Old Masters' Art Gallery (open 10am-6pm every day except Monday, Dm7) and a fine array of the famous Meissen porcelain that is created just down the river and is known asDresden's gold (museum open 10am-6pm every day except Thursday, Dm3). Meissen ceramic also creates the impressive Furstenzug, a six-meter-high frieze depicting the rulers of the Saxony region from 1123 to 1904. By contrast the souvenir vendors opposite have postcards of the 1944 devastation and photos of the piles of the dead. But it seems that the town council is eager to erase this shocking memory and bury it under gilt and plaster curlicues. What to see The new hero of the city is Augustus the Strong (1670-1733), who made Dresden the capital of his kingdom that incorporated this region of Saxony as well as a part of Poland. Augustus is a rather dubious choice for a hero considering that he was little more than a Russian puppet and his nickname is said to come from the number of mistresses he took rather than his abilities as a ruler. Forty-odd years of rule under the flag of the German Democratic Republic are also being dismantled. There is an empty plinth between the fountains in Prager Strasse which once held a giant statue of Lenin, flanked on either side by clench-fisted workers carrying a flag, presumably red. It is said that one person is collecting all the discarded Lenin statues and keeping them all in his back garden. Perhaps he has a neighbour who has taken in all the distinctive Trabant cars, which have almost completely disappeared from the streets during the past 10 years, although matchbox models are sold in the tourist office. The pedestrianised Prager Strasse now overflows with shops, cafés and fast food, much like any other west European city street. But on the left side as you walk towards the Elbe, a department store is covered in small silver pyramids, a tantalising left-over of communist-style architecture, It used to be the only place displaying the electrical gadgets and consumer goods that no ordinary citizen could afford. Across the river from the old city, Neustadt has seen a blossoming of the underground youth and artistic culture that was such a persistent thorn in the side of the GDR. The area has little courtyards, opening one into another, each with its own slightly off-beat style. In one, drainpipes have been transformed from an ordinary building accessory into an art form. Nightlife In Gorlitzer Strasse, there are bars and restaurants of every description, and the present exchange rate makes most places cheap for the British visitor. As you linger late into the night, eating, drinking and listening to music, you may well wonder how it was possible for any regime (even one that was backed by a terrifying secret police as well as the Russian army) to keep all this creativity and vitality repressed. Out of town When the centre of town gets too much, Dresden has much to offer in terms of wide green spaces. The Grosser Gartens also has a baroque palace, botanical gardens and a zoo. Or you can take a stroll and then enjoy a picnic along the banks of the Elbe. Alternatively, hire a bike from the central station (at platform 3, for a cost of Dm10 a day) and cycle through the forest on the east side of Neustadt to an open-air pool. Here you can cool off and sunbathe among the pine trees. A cycle path stretches from the Czech border via Dresden to Meissen. Further afield there is Meissen itself and the Sachische Schweiz national park in the Saxony Switzerland part of Germany. There is a strange otherworldliness to the sandstone features that have been carved out among the trees over the course of the past six million years. Paths follow streams that lead inevitably to the wide curves of the Elbe. From there, a leisurely boat trip takes you back to the heart of Dresden. Another day-trip by train or coach from Dresden is Moritzburg. It was a hunting lodge for Augustus the Strong and is inevitably Baroque in style. So walk round the park and enjoy the lake.

There is the one sold in the tourist brochures, a place of coral gardens and dolphins, of alligators and teeming swamps, heritage trails and gallery-hopping. And there is Carl Hiaasen's version. Hiaasen is the blazing conscience of the sunshine state, the chronicler of property developers masquerading as gangsters and gangsters masquerading as property developers, of bent politicians and judges, of drug wars and theme-park murders. In his version, Florida is a place ruled by 'ribbon snippers' and ruined by 'greedheads'. P.J. O'Rourke once observed that the only thing more likely to kill Florida's tourist trade than reading Carl Hiaasen was a visit there. It wasn't always so. When Hiaasen first came down here as a boy 40 years ago from his home near Fort Lauderdale, it was the kind of paradise described in the brochures. 'Being able to move to the Keys was a dream I had ever since I was five years old,' he says, bright-eyed. 'The first time my dad brought me here we stayed in this tiny little place called Tarpon Lodge and I remember running out to the dock with my grandfather and looking down over the side and seeing snappers and barracuda and parrot fish. It was all so beautiful, and I thought if I ever swing it, if I ever get lucky enough, this is where I would like to raise a family.' Five years ago, Hiaasen got lucky enough to buy a little slice of his boyhood. Sitting outside his house, with its unbroken views of Florida Bay, a path leading down to a mooring where his neat skiff is tied, a fish eagle perched on top of his boathouse, you could easily convince yourself that the remembered paradise still exists. Hiaasen writes here most days, brings his new baby down to watch the porpoises playing around the dockside in the early morning, takes the boat out to fish at dusk. To reach his little Nirvana, however, you have to flog down from Miami past the tattoo parlours and the pet grooming salons and the T-shirt halls of fame, past the salmon-pink motels with their Texaco garage (circa 1970) architecture, past the inevitable Denny's and Wendy's, the marinas and condos and malls that crowd the ribbon of land between Interstate 1 and the sea. Islamorada - the name means purple isles - is, in the tourist board's judgment, the sports fishing capital of the world. On a bad day, though, Hiaasen sees his home town simply as a 'urination stop' for the occupants of several thousand hire cars on the road to the original Margaritaville, Keywest. One of Hiaasen's editors once described his decision to move down here as being akin to keeping a bedside vigil with a dying relative. You could say that he has a love-hate relationship with his home state, the central character in his novels, but that would be underplaying it. 'Florida is my life,' he said. 'If I had any sense at all, I'd have baled out a long time ago. I guess it's a place I believe is worth fighting for and worth fighting about. So I stayed.' Hiaasen does his scrapping with the greatest possible panache. In his celebrated muckraking newspaper column in the Miami Herald , he chooses his targets carefully and fillets them mercilessly. 'I live for jumping on crooked politicians,' he says. In the recent past, his subjects have included a district attorney accused of biting a stripper in a go-go lounge, a junkie judge who fuelled his habit with $30,000 bribes from the FBI, and the state governor who oversaw a dozen squad cars being sent to arrest the rap group 2LiveCrew for their inflammatory lyrics. Those scumbags who don't make it into his column tend to crop up one way or another in his novels. Hiaasen is the author of eight hellish, hilarious visions of tropical greed and excess, the ultimate beach reading. The latest, Sick Puppy , has a typically extravagant plot involving a dognapping and a rogue rhino, a drive-by eco-warrior exacting savage revenge on people who throw litter from convertibles and a cast of condo-constructing, mangrove-trashing low-lives, who get their weekend thrills shooting gimpy zoo animals in mocked-up hunts. 'The fiction is a pretty good outlet for things you can't get away with in journalism,' he says smiling. 'I don't pick particular people and say you're going to be a character in my novel, but certainly they are composites. The lobby ist in Sick Puppy - Palmer Stote - is a very accurate representation of what a political lobbyist does down here, ie bribery, extortion, general sleaze. I combine traits and eccentricities. For example, Stote carries six cellphones like one lobbyist I know. Some of these people are OK, but many of them are such despicable human beings that you don't know how they get up of a morning and look at themselves in a mirror. I kind of skim the worst of the worst.' Hiaasen is sometimes accused of being too outlandish in his comedy. He argues that he never writes anything that does not happen and often what he does write is overtaken by events. Since he's described the grimly staged 'big game hunts', for example, there have been a couple of investigations into similar operations in the region. 'The greatest difficulty,' he says, 'is that it's very hard to stay ahead of the curve of weirdness in this place. I'm increasingly frustrated because everything I've imagined has come to pass.' Like all the best satirists, the quality that Hiaasen prizes above all others is innocence. He grew up in a town called Plantation. His grandfather, originally from a small Norwegian community in North Dakota, had been among the first to settle there; he set up a law practice, which Hiaasen's father inherited. It was his grandfather who instilled in Hiaasen a love of books. 'He didn't speak English until he was 13, but he educated himself, put himself through law school, he was a preacher too, and he read literally until he couldn't see any more,' Hiaasen recalls. 'He lived to be 100 and when he died I went through his books, and nearly every one of them had these very fine margin notes on almost every page. But when I started writing fiction, it puzzled him. He was from a world where you read to gain knowledge, not for entertainment.' Plantation was then the westernmost town in Florida, bordering the Everglades. Beyond it, there was just 'swamps and water and snakes and critters', territory which Hiaasen and his friends used to explore in little boats, camping out, catching water moccasins. Now the interstate goes out beyond there, and the Everglades has shrunk to half its previous size, threatening the entire ecology of the region; much of Hiaasen's childhood has been paved over. The development had begun when he was a child and he can't remember a time when he was not angry about it. 'As kids, we would go out every day and there would be a bulldozer tearing down the place where we had a fort or a den, so there was this sense of outrage. You know, do they have to destroy everything we love?' He fantasised about direct action, 'but we were just kids on bicycles with fishing rods'. The closest they ever got to eco-terrorism was shifting surveyors' poles around. But from an early age, he thought that writing about the desecration might be a way of getting people to take notice. He put out a magazine at high school, called More Trash , which was 'less satirical than smart ass', but it brought home to him that 'by writing strong opinions about topical things everybody felt a need to read it, and they were perversely interested in who you were going to needle next'. After college, he joined the Herald as a reporter and started needling full-time. During the cocaine wars of the early Eighties, when there were machine- gun shoot-outs in Miami's shopping malls, Hiaasen was writing analytical pieces about the Colombian-based gangs and their Florida pushers. His editor at the time, Bill Montalbano, told him that the stories they were publishing were 'too good for the newspaper' and suggested that they sat down together to write a novel. In fact, Hiaasen notes, Montalbano's motivation was more venal: 'He just got remarried, had a little child and wanted to buy a swimming-pool.' They wrote five chapters and sent them off. Two weeks later, the book was sold, the swimming-pool ordered. Hiaasen and Montalbano did three traditional mystery detective books together and Hiaasen subsequently began writing fiction on his own. His first book, Tourist Season , which features the ransoming of the Orange Bowl Queen and the aerial bombardments of cruise ships, set the tone for what followed. Hiaasen has been accused in the past simply of hating tourists. He is, it is true, fond of calling the 46 million visitors to Florida each year, many of whom drive past his front door, 'tourons' (to rhyme with morons). But he pleads innocent to the general charge. 'Some people come down here and they stare at the water and the islands and they are completely awestruck and mesmerised by it all in the same way that I am,' he says, warming up for a mini-rant. 'But what I don't understand is where they take these boats out every day and feed dolphins buckets of fish so they don't know how to hunt any more, and then they let all these kids jump in and touch them. It's not enough to see something in nature; you have to turn it into some fucking attraction. The compulsion to be entertained is what drives this county. We have to be led into a queue and then stand there and wait to be shown something. It's like a disease here. And as a result, many people cannot connect to anything that is simply natural.' The disease he describes has its nerve centre a few hundred miles north of the Keys in the original Magic Kingdom in Orlando. Hiaasen's life ambition is to be banned forever from DisneyWorld. To this end, he wrote a little pamphlet about the corporation called Team Rodent. It is a brilliant, often savagely funny critique of how 'Mouse-witz' conquered his state. 'The absolute worst thing Disney did,' he wrote, and in Hiaasen's view that is saying something, 'was to change how people in Florida thought about money; nobody ever dreamed there could be so much. Bankers, lawyers, real-estate salesmen, hoteliers, farmers, citrus growers - everyone in Mickey's orbit had drastically to recalibrate the concepts of growth. Suddenly, there were no limits. Merely by showing up, Disney had dignified blind greed in a state pioneered by undignified greedheads. Everything the company touched turned to gold, so everyone in Florida craved to touch or be touched by Disney. The gate opened and in galloped fresh hordes. The orange groves and citrus stands of old Orlando rapidly gave way to an execrable panorama of urban blight.' His 80-page mousehunt concludes with a memorable, couldn't-make-it-up investigation into the peculiar death from rectal injuries of a rare black rhino in Disney's newly opened Animal Kingdom. 'I'm perhaps the only man you have ever met who has pictures of a rhino necropsy stashed away somewhere,' he says. Hiaasen can see the comedy in all this but the principle he takes enormously seriously. I wonder if he has any hope that the Disney-based destruction might be reversed in some way; is there any going back? He talks of the encouragement he gets from people who read his books and who care in the same way about the concreting of their own childhood. 'But no,' he says, 'it can't be reversed, though the hurricanes help occasionally. They sort of purge the place.' The other effective purgative is Hiaasen's column. He can point to instances where he has made a small difference: a guy recently who decided to cut down 12,000 mangroves - the hub of Florida's eco-system - in a state national park to give himself a sea view was the subject of one recent attack, and he was subsequently arrested. 'Of course, he's got a big lawyer and he'll probably get off in the end, but it's causing him no end of misery and maybe the next asshole that comes along - and there's always the next asshole - will think twice about it.' Given the nature of Hiaasen's column, it is perhaps surprising that he has not had more legal difficulties. The only person who has ever sued him was 'one of our insane mayors', a man he dubbed Mayor Loco. 'I didn't accuse the guy of any crime or attribute to him any nasty diseases, just kept calling him Mayor Loco. It later turned out that the election he won was stolen - a whole bunch of dead people had voted for him, so he was kicked out. The lawsuit against me did not allege any liability. It just said that after he'd been kicked out for rigging elections and no one would hire him because they knew him as Mayor Loco. Our response was that we would be happy to have psychiatrists look at him - this was a guy who used to turn up at the newspaper office ranting in his bathrobe - and clearly he didn't fancy that.' Does he never feel like a quieter life, just getting on with his fishing? 'Some days, I really enjoy writing the column,' he says, 'and some days it's the purest form of torture. I still agonise over every miserable adjective. When you get fired up and you have something to write about, like during the Elian Gonzalez case, then you just have to go nuts, because you're speaking for a lot of people who're pulling their hair out.' But there are other moments when he considers packing it in. Hiaasen is 47 now; he was first married when he was 17 ('We were crazy about each other and it seemed like the right thing to do). He has a son from that marriage, Scott, 29, who is also a journalist, and from his second marriage he has a nine-year-old stepson, Ryan and a baby, Quinn, born at the beginning of this year. His daughter-in-law is expecting twins. 'So I'm going to be a grandfather and a father in the same year. I'm waiting for the call from Jerry Springer. 'There's certainly a temptation when you reach a certain age just to chill out and look out only for the people you care about. Now I've got a little one in the house it would be nice occasionally not to have to deal with crazies on your answering machine or the odd threat in the mail or whatever. Of course, after the Gonzales stuff, I got a bunch of letters saying I was anti-Hispanic and a racist and a Castro sympathiser. And, of course, I could not resist sending these people back letters saying, \"Please keep it quiet but I've been working for the communists for years\". And signed them Carl \"Che\" Hiaasen.' But he doesn't see much hope of himself mellowing out - 'I know I'd be miserable doing that'; if anything he thinks he'll get madder as he gets older. He points to a passage in Sick Puppy which he says is about as close to his philosophy as anything in his books. It comes from Skink, a recurrent alter-ego, an ex-governor gone native in the Everglades: 'People like us are doomed to be angry, and to stay angry, because that's the only way things get changed.' Before I leave, Hiaasen, the most laid-back angry man I have met, shows me around his garage. Around the walls are half-a-dozen tanks containing pet reptiles. He has a frog that eats mice, a wedding gift from his lawyer: 'It has canines but it's kind of slow,' he says. 'Sometimes, the mouse survives in there for a day before he catches up with it.' He takes out a couple of snakes from other tanks. One, which can apparently pretend to be a rattler, is five feet long. Does it bite? I ask. 'They have razor-sharp teeth, but you won't see them until they're embedded in you,' he says. 'Then you have problems.' With Hiaasen around, a lot of Florida's legislators and businessmen, you imagine, know exactly that feeling. Hiaasen on Hiaasen Tourist Season 'This involved the kidnapping of the Orange Bowl queen which was, no doubt, a submerged teenage fantasy of mine. ' Double Whammy 'Sex, murder and corruption on the professional bass-fishing circuit. This was territory I had pretty much to myself. I couldn't see much danger of Updike or Norman Mailer going in that direction.' Lucky You 'A good old-fashioned tale of greed and the Florida state lottery. ' Skintight 'I thought I had invented the most repellent plastic surgeon ever but he has since been eclipsed. The other day, we had a guy arrested: a bodybuilder had come in asking for pectoral implants and this guy used breast implants instead. He woke up with a boob on each shoulder.' Native Tongue 'Any time you can have a villain romanced to death by a dolphin and manage to convince your editors that it's an important component of your novel, you're doing something right.' Strip Tease 'The book was about how you can always count on men to behave badly.' Sick Puppy 'I enjoy the idea of beating a litterbug senseless, because that's a death-penalty issue. Haul them off and straight into the electric chair. No question.' • Sick Puppy is published by Macmillan at £16.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2000/jul/03/nepal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-03T00:27:10Z","webTitle":"Police accused of dirty war against Nepal's Maoist guerrillas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/03/nepal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/03/nepal","fields":{"headline":"Police accused of dirty war against Nepal's Maoist guerrillas","bodyText":"They arrived at Rama Yadav's house at night, locked his children in the kitchen and seized his cashbox. Then the Maoist rebels who have been fighting the Nepalese state for four years fled to a nearby village. The police caught up with them there. Six rebels unwisely took shelter in a house. The police set light to it. In the gun battle that followed all the rebels were shot dead except one - 17-year-old Bhagwati Chaudhary. According to human rights agencies, the police interrogated her, then shot her. That summary execution last month is just the latest example of extra-judicial killing in Nepal. Since 1996 the authorities have been struggling to contain the growing communist insurgency in the remote mid-west of what was once a peaceful Himalayan kingdom. At least 1,500 people have been killed, two thirds of them by the Nepalese police. \"We have very clear evidence that extra-judicial killing is going on,\" Krishna Pahadi of the Human Rights and Peace Society said. \"If the police suspect someone of being a Maoist they simply kill them.\" The situation has become so grave that the European Union recently intervened for the first time, urging the Nepalese government not to violate human rights and to begin talks with the Maoist rebels. Nepal's hardline prime minister, Girja Koirala, who came to power in March advocating a military solution to the Maoist problem, now appears to have responded to international pressure. \"There is no alternative to talks,\" he said. But his critics say he is not serious about negotiation. The Maoists have also been responsible for a series of outrages. Two months ago they beheaded a suspected informer, leaving the victim's head in a tree. Two weeks ago they killed 21 people, including 12 policemen, during a gunfight in the Jarjarkot district of western Nepal. They have ruthlessly eliminated supporters of the ruling Nepali Congress and other rival parties. About 1.5m of Nepal's 20m people now live under their control, in what amounts to a de facto state run from the hill district of Rolpa. Active also in several districts in the east of Nepal, they have an army of between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, armed with homemade guns and primitive bombs. Successive governments in Katmandu have been slow to respond to the crisis. Earlier this month 150 refugees from the west of Nepal arrived in Katmandu after a gruelling 26-day trek, seeking government protection. They say that their MPs are now too scared to live in the districts they represent. \"We have become victims of both police and Maoist guerrillas. In the eyes of police, we are the supporter of Maoist and in the eyes of Maoist guerrillas we are informers to the police,\" Him Bahadur Budha, from Rolpa, said. The insurgency is masterminded by Prachanda, the general secretary of the underground Maoist Communist party. His aim is to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and replace it with a Maoist republic. The group, which began its uprising in February 1996, has links with other revolutionary groups. In Maoist villages, where the red flag flies, Prachanda has introduced collective farming. His cadres collect taxes and impose justice. The former MP Padma Ratna Tuladhar, who has been asked by the prime minister to negotiate with the rebels, said yesterday that he was \"pessimistic\" that the conflict could be swiftly resolved. Before sitting down to talks, the Maoists want the police to account for more than 40 supporters who have disappeared while in custody. Before his government collapsed under the pressure of the Maoist problem, the former prime minister Krishna Bhattarai said that many of the detainees had been executed without trial. The Maoists' paper, Janesh, recently conceded that some members had grown corrupt. The movement was going through a period of \"critical self-evaluation\", it said. But in many areas the Maoists continue to enjoy popular support. In the village of Kara, for example, which the police burned to the ground last year, the son of a prominent politician kidnapped by the Maoists has been put to work as a stonemason. Pitamber Sharma, of the Integrated Centre for Mountain Development, said yesterday that only economic reform could stop the insurgency. \"In the mountains 60-65% live below the poverty line. There is no electricity, no television and no transport,\" he said. \"I don't see any prospect of the Maoists taking over Nepal. But if conditions continue as they do, we are going to create a situation of protracted civil war.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jul/03/election2001.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-03T17:12:34Z","webTitle":"United kingdoms need freedom to choose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/03/election2001.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jul/03/election2001.politics","fields":{"headline":"United kingdoms need freedom to choose","bodyText":"Devolving power from Westminster and creating the first fully legislative parliament in Scotland for almost 300 years is one of the Labour government's most significant achievements. But devolution was always intended to be an evolutionary process: now that Scotland has home rule, it is time to move to stage two. In Scotland, the first taste of devolved power has whetted the appetite for more, and Labour must start by sorting out some anachronisms. Since 1999, the Scottish parliament has controlled all matters related to health save one: abortion. This anomaly is unsustainable. To imply that Edinburgh cannot be trusted to decide for itself on this basic matter of women's health shows a fear of real devolution. Because it remains a matter of conscience, there should be no manifesto commitment to changing Scotland's existing legislation on abortion. But the Scots should have the right to choose; refusing to devolve issues because they are sensitive is political cowardice. It has long been accepted that arts, culture and sport are fundamental to Scotland's sense of national identity. It seems obvious that legislative power on these matters should be devolved. Yet broadcasting remains a reserved matter, decided at Westminster. In the interests of British unity, Labour should devolve legislative power on broadcasting to the Scottish parliament. The constitutional tidy-up does not end there. Scotland is over-represented at Westminster. It has, proportionally, far more MPs than any other part of the UK. This has caused division, as the perception grows that Scotland is allowed to punch above its fair weight. The government has already made a commitment to reduce the number of Scots MPs at Westminster, enshrined in the Scotland Act, but that promise should be reaffirmed and acted on within the first year of a second term. Secondly, no Westminster government should be allowed to rely on Scottish MPs to push through legislation which is of concern only to England and Wales. That would inflict on England and Wales the very fate Scotland endured for too long. But banning Scots MPs from voting on purely English and Welsh matters, as the Conservatives have suggested, would strike at the very heart of the union. Instead, the custom of Scots MPs refraining from voting on such issues should continue and, to reassure voters elsewhere, perhaps be made a formal commitment. By reducing the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster and formalising voting customs, Scotland's voice in the Commons will be more legitimate and therefore stronger. But to ensure that this happens, the Scottish grand committee should be abolished; the place for raising Scottish concerns is in the Commons, not in a powerless side-show. Since Scotland forms its own identity within and not apart from the United Kingdom, it will also become increasingly obvious that there is no longer a need for a Scottish secretary at cabinet level. Matters of purely Scottish concern are dealt with in Edinburgh and matters of concern for the whole of the UK should be dealt with at UK level. So Labour should abolish the Scotland Office, the Scottish secretary and his minister. There will obviously still be a need for co-ordination between the assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast and the parliaments in Edinburgh and Westminster, and a new cabinet post - a minister for the isles - might be created. These changes will help shape the new Scotland, but they are not enough on their own. Labour must also look again at the system of funding. Scotland has very different needs from the rest of the United Kingdom, but these are costed using a decades-old process, the Barnett formula, which allocates increases in public expenditure to Scotland and Wales on the basis of population. An independent inquiry should re-examine this. Re-examination should not be a backdoor method of reducing Scotland's funding, but if the countries of these islands are to develop and work together, then we need to ensure each one does so from the most appropriate footing. That way, we can build a strong, prosperous and united Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2000/jul/04/furthereducation.theguardian3","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-04T01:03:39Z","webTitle":"Military might","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/jul/04/furthereducation.theguardian3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/jul/04/furthereducation.theguardian3","fields":{"headline":"Military might","bodyText":"In a rare display of joined-up government last week John Spellar, Minister for the Armed Forces, and Malcolm Wicks, Minister for Lifelong Learning, clutched a gigantic silver spanner together in front of a damaged tracked army vehicle in the middle of a military base in Shropshire. This fetching tableau, which also included a group of smiling trainee engineering apprentices, was a visual metaphor for an unusual act of collaboration between the two ministries. With the end of the cold war, the army's civilian repair organisation - ABRO or the Army Base Repair Organisation - has more than halved in size. This has resulted in the organisation needing to train fewer civilian mechanical, electrical and electronic engineers to repair army equipment, such as tanks, guns, radios and bomb disposal equipment. The ABRO repair facility in Donnington, near Telford, Shropshire, indentured just 18 MoD apprentices last year. And three of ABRO's seven UK repair centres have been operating with spare training capacity. Two years ago Mr Spellar recognised that this capacity could be used to train additional apprentices who could be employed by industry, which was suffering from widespread, intermediate-level engineering skill shortages. Such an initiative would strengthen the country's reservoir of core engineering skills at relatively lit tle extra cost to the national economy. Mr Spellar managed to persuade the DfEE to pay for the wages of 21 additional apprentices. Fourteen of these recruits are just coming to the end of their first year of training at Donnington, while the other seven are training at two other repair centres. Last Thursday the ministers visited the repair facility to celebrate the success of the joint venture. The first year trainees, who are paid a weekly wage of £127, spend one day a week at Telford College of Arts and Technology studying for City and Guilds or BTEC qualifications, and the rest of the week learning skills such as welding and machining in the repair facility workshops. All the apprentices are security cleared and have to sign the Official Secrets Act. First year apprentices, who are usually 16 or 17 years old, also spend one week on an outward bound course bonding into a team. Jim Drew, ABRO's chief executive, described MoD craft apprentices as being the envy of the industrial world because they are so well trained. Malcolm Wicks, Minister for Lifelong Learning, said that since the second world war Germany had taken the professional skills training of its young people who did not go to university very seriously. The United Kingdom, he added, needs to get better at intermediate level skills training and this MoD/DFEE departmental collaboration was one way of providing more first-class training. The countries that take skills and training seriously, he added, are the ones that will prosper. It is hoped that manufacturing companies will agree to sponsor future generations of additional apprentices who will also be able to benefit from using ABRO's world-class facilities and training expertise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jul/04/drugsandalcohol.drugspolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-04T01:04:15Z","webTitle":"Legalise cannabis, says Labour adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/04/drugsandalcohol.drugspolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jul/04/drugsandalcohol.drugspolicy","fields":{"headline":"Legalise cannabis, says Labour adviser","bodyText":"A key government adviser last night advocated the legalisation of cannabis as part of a radical overhaul of political and cultural institutions in Britain. Lord Haskins, a Labour peer and chairman of the better regulation taskforce, said the BBC should take advertising, the Church of England should be disestablished and the country's main sporting bodies dumped. In a wide-ranging speech that surprised delegates at the Radio Academy's annual gathering in Glasgow, Lord Haskins predicted a complete break-up of the United Kingdom, leading to economic and cultural decline, if his warnings were not heeded. Lord Haskins's views - particularly on the BBC - are likely to be taken seriously, as he is regarded as an important adviser to the government in areas of regulation. The BBC's charter is due to be reviewed in 2006, and the debate over its future is under way. But it was the peer's remarks about drugs that caused most surprise. \"The state perseveres with some moral regulations which are mainly symbolic and largely ineffective in protecting the young, such as rules against under-age selling of tobacco, drink and lottery tickets, and total bans on drug selling,\" he said. \"Such regulations are, if anything, counterproductive. The excitement of breaking them becomes a stimulant.\" Such rules simply \"criminalise the market\", he said. Lord Haskins said he believed cannabis should be legalised, and that harder drugs could be made more readily available on prescription as part of medical programmes to treat addicts. The peer's stance is sharply at odds with government policy. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has taken a tough line on illegal substances, and will not countenance any relaxation of the laws governing hard drugs. He is also opposed to the decriminalisation of cannabis - let alone its legalisation. The government's only concession to campaigners has been to permit limited trials to test the drug's medical benefits. In last night's lecture, which was sponsored by the Guardian Media Group, Lord Haskins delivered a wide-ranging attack on the state of regulation in Britain, and called for radical institutional reform. Bodies such as the MCC (now the England Cricket Board), the Football Association, the Lawn Tennis Association and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club should be scrapped. \"They gave the world the games of cricket, football, tennis and golf, but have, through their privileged, unaccountable incompetence, reduced British sport to the third division.\" He could see no need for the restrictive licensing laws, which served only to encourage hooliganism, nor any justification to maintain an established church. Any attempt to regulate the internet \"to prevent it from doing moral damage to us\" would be a \"fruitless exercise\". People should be free to download pornography if they wanted, so long as it did not harm a third party. The monarchy should be reformed, and the House of Lords abolished. He also criticised Prince Charles's stance on GM foods, saying advances in technology were of great advantage to poorer countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jul/05/saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-05T00:21:28Z","webTitle":"Opec in turmoil as Saudis drive down prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/05/saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/05/saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Opec in turmoil as Saudis drive down prices","bodyText":"Opec was thrown into turmoil yesterday by a Saudi decision to turn on the taps and force down oil prices. The surprise move by the desert kingdom was seen as a sign of its willingness to please Washington at the cost of alienating its Middle East neighbours. Fearing that high oil prices could cause inflation and slow down economic growth, the United States has been pressing for action. But the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, representing the producers of 40% of the world's oil, offered only a modest increase in production, and that failed to move the markets. On Monday Saudi Arabia - the world's biggest oil producer and the only country capable of shifting prices single-handedly - came to the rescue, announcing that it would \"very soon\" increase production by 500,000 barrels a day unless crude prices - currently about $30 (£20) a barrel - came down. Yesterday Kuwait and Qatar complained that they had not been consulted, and Iran accused the kingdom of violating agreements. The Iraqi oil minister, Lieutenant-General Amer Mohammed Rashid, denounced the Saudis for giving in to pressure from the US, where petrol prices have become an issue in the presidential election. The Venezuelan president of Opec, Ali Rodriguez, also joined the fray. \"Before Saudi Arabia takes any decision it is essential to hold consultations. Until now we have always taken decisions by consensus,\" he said In the US, Vice-President Al Gore immediately welcomed the Saudi move, saying: \"I want to call on the big oil companies to let that Saudi output increase pass through in the form of price reductions to the people who are filling their cars.\" Although oil producers have been enjoying a revenue bonanza recently, Opec regards $25 a barrel as a more reasonable level. Over-high prices can cause inflation and, in the long term, are bad for producers because they encourage customers to economise on oil or switch to alternatives. Saudi Arabia has a reserve capacity of 2.5m barrels a day. Half of this can be restarted quickly, though the other half would take several months. But Roger Diwan of the Washington consultancy Petroleum Finance Corporation says Saudi Arabia's actual production levels may be less important than the psychological effect on the market. \"What matters is the announcement,\" he said. \"The Saudis are trying to force oil traders to start betting prices down. Their aim is to show traders the trend, because betting against Saudi Arabia is not a good idea.\" Oil prices fell from around $25 a barrel in 1997 to under $10 in 1999, mainly as a result of the crisis in Asia's \"tiger\" economies and mild winters in the northern hemisphere. Since last year, they have risen rapidly, partly because of collective action by Opec. But the rise has continued beyond Opec's target range of $22 to $28. The Iranians, in particular, blame the US for the most recent increases, saying they are due to factors in the American market rather than a shortage of global production. Refinery bottlenecks and anti-pollution regulations requiring different types of petrol have pushed up prices at filling stations. Meanwhile, stockpiles of oil acquired at low prices have been reduced to almost nothing, because companies risk losing money if they replenish them now and prices subsequently fall. One result of this, according to industry analysts, is that at present consumers have no cushion against a disruption of supplies from less dependable sources such as Iraq, Nigeria, Colombia and Angola. Because of UN sanctions, Iraq does have an Opec quota, but it exports just under 2m barrels a day through the oil-for-food programme. The bulk of this goes to the US and Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/jul/05/rover","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-05T00:21:46Z","webTitle":"Ministers proud of their complacency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/05/rover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jul/05/rover","fields":{"headline":"Ministers proud of their complacency","bodyText":"The government yesterday sought to draw a line under its role in the Rover debacle earlier this year. Its response to the trade and industry select committee's report on the events leading up to BMW's decision on March 16 to sell Rover is a model of self-serving, self-exculpating platitudes. Ministers, especially industry secretary Stephen Byers, it says, are off the hook. But are they? Recent events, most notably Nissan's threats, show that the story is far from over. The issues raised by BMW three months ago about the strength of sterling, competitiveness and Britain's very commitment to manufacturing remain unresolved. The takeover of the Longbridge plant by the Phoenix consortium, the government said yesterday, \"offers good prospects both for continued volume manufacture\" and \"for the retention of jobs\". But that brings a host of questions, not least whether Phoenix can deliver on its pledge to produce around 200,000 units a year of the model range bequeathed by BMW and introduce new models in a European market awash with cars chased by too few buyers. The government professes itself pleased, too, at the sale of Land Rover to Ford, but the division's new chief executive, Bob Dover, has said this week that Britain is \"a very bad place to make cars\" because of the pound, poor transport infrastructure and high fuel costs. David Botterill, the Engineering Employers' Federation chief executive in the West Midlands, said a quarter of his members, or 400 companies, supplied the automotive industry and their output remained at risk because of the pound and uncertainty surrounding Rover. The government says the immediate threat to suppliers has receded with Phoenix. This seems grotesquely complacent when tens of thousands of jobs, in marginal constituencies, are at stake. Forget the leaks from senior civil servants and ambassadors; this government needs to make clear its intentions towards manufacturing and its role in the modern economy. That means, as with everything else these days, its intentions towards the euro. Price pumpers The price of London Brent fell less than a dollar yesterday following Saudi Arabia's unilateral decision to turn on the crude production taps. The stock market rightly saw this as the end of a period of sky high oil prices and punished the oil companies accordingly. Riyadh's initiative came ten days after the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to make token cuts which failed to move the markets. The price is currently still well short of the OPEC target figure of $25, remaining three times the level of 18 months ago. It was when the crude oil price hit rock bottom that the Opec nations imposed production restrictions in order to inflate the price. Prices above $30 per barrel are good news for the desert kingdoms' coffers but cause political conflict with the Saudis' biggest customer and strategic defence ally, the US. While the move was being interpreted as a willingness to please its American friends, self-interest was also very much part of the Saudi strategy. The Saudis sit on the biggest oil reserves in the world and are keen to retard growth in the use of alternative energy resources such as gas and renewables. They also want to avoid rivals searching far and wide for their own new sources of oil, particularly in areas such as the Caspian sea, off Brazil and Angola. Both the US and Mexico claimed prior knowledge of the Saudi decision, whereas Middle East neighbours such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates complained that they had been kept in the dark. Some in the west interpreted this as a deliberate snub, but wiser heads put it down to Saudi diplomatic ineptitude. Certainly Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi was working hard later on to sooth his Opec colleagues' ruffled feathers. Al-Naimi said that, if the price did not decrease, Saudi and other producers would increase production by another 500,000 barrels. In fact only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE have the power to increase output anyway. Other Opec countries are close to capacity. Still the manner of the Saudi announcement - by-passing Opec channels - will undermine the oil cartel while emphasising the world's biggest oil producer's willingness to go it alone. The US vice-president, Al Gore, was quick to congratulate the Saudis. Washington has been putting increasing pressure on the kingdom after taking flak from consumers at a sensitive time, with the presidential elections looming. American motorists are now wrestling with record high gasoline costs. The US government has even been looking at tax cuts to reduce the pump price. It would be safe to assume the British government is not contemplating a similar move."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2000/jul/06/internetnews.onlinesupplement","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-06T00:10:49Z","webTitle":"BBC has web world up in arms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jul/06/internetnews.onlinesupplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jul/06/internetnews.onlinesupplement","fields":{"headline":"BBC has web world up in arms","bodyText":"Even in the super-charged internet world, the BBC's dot.com juggernaut is gathering impressive pace. It could end today with a lorry load of evidence that it is miles ahead of the competition. In the 2000 European Online Journalism Awards, to be presented tonight at the NetMedia conference at City University, London, the BBC is shortlisted in 14 of the 19 categories. Auntie could win gongs in everything from design to investigative reporting, via business and economics and music and entertainment. This comes only 10 days after the Henley Centre ranked the BBC top of the 10 most trusted websites in the UK. And it follows hard on the heels of Monday's unveiling of a revamped sports website, backed by funding of up to £6m and 45 staff. That is almost as many staff as work on the hugely successful News Online stablemate, which has recently upped its profile even further by doing a deal with Yahoo!, the UK's second most popular website, to have its content displayed on the site's news pages. This appears to be a big success story: the BBC transferring its content on to the internet, building its brand online and gaining great respect around the world; 40% of BBC Online's traffic comes from overseas, although the UK traffic is still enough to rank it the 9th most popular site in the UK. But from the rest of the UK's online publishing industry come howls of protest. Commercial publishers say the BBC is steamrolling into areas already well served by the private sector, and using licence-fee money to snatch traffic away - even making it difficult for private sites to secure that oxygen of online business, venture capital. The British Internet Publishers' Alliance (Bipa), is leading criticism of the BBC's online drive. Bipa has submitted evidence to the Davies review of the future funding of the BBC, and the House of Commons' select committee on culture, media and sport last year, when it was considering the future of the BBC. Its argument was summed up by Bipa chairman and Daily Telegraph director, Sir Frank Rogers, in a letter to the Times in April. \"There is no case whatsoever,\" he wrote, \"for the BBC to use public money to become a major electronic publisher on the internet.\" The net, with its lower costs and already diverse content, did not need a public service organisation to drive wide take-up of internet services, said Rogers. He described the much touted notion of convergence, where TV, radio and internet content is delivered to consumers on a single device, as \"a seductive and misleading prediction\". It is not hard to see why privately funded internet publishers are afraid of the BBC moving into their patch. While the start-ups struggle to raise finance and discover the so-far elusive revenue streams, the BBC has no such concerns. BBC Online's £32m budget last year came from the licence fee, and the site does not carry advertising or sponsorship. This week provided one of the best examples of the unfairness of the BBC's position, its detractors say. When the corporation decided to launch its new sports website, £1.5m was found to set the new venture up, along with an annual budget of £4-£5m. With the sports website market already one of the most competitive in the UK net industry, it is unlikely a start-up would have been able to convince venture capitalists to part with that kind of money. Stephen Nuttall, head of sport at Sportal.co.uk, wryly points out that BBC Sport Online's spending money this year is more than his company's entire first round of funding. \"And that was to put up an international network of sports sites, not just the UK,\" he adds. Sportal scored a coup with its exclusive internet rights to Euro2000, and was named the best private internet company in Europe last weekend. But, says Nuttall, the BBC's renewed interest in online sport takes the gloss off his company's successes. The BBC has a big budget and, just importantly, it can cross-promote the online service on radio and television, he says. The BBC's determination to carve a niche in online sports will not make it an easy neighbour, he says. \"The world does not need another sports site. If someone was trying to raise venture capital for a sports start-up, I think that their business plan would be scrutinised very carefully indeed. Who is going to scrutinise the BBC's?\" According to Bipa, that scrutiny is badly needed to stop the BBC smothering newborn dot.coms with its own launches. Angela Mills, its secretary, says the BBC's public service role needs to be redefined. \"Nobody in Bipa is saying that the BBC has no place on the internet. We're not saying it should be kicked off,\" she says. \"It is just a question of making sure there are clear parameters between what is publicly funded and what falls within the private sector, and that proper rules apply in both.\" But is BIPA's case not built on vested interests and more than a hint of sour grapes? Even new media commentators based in the US are expected to say at NetMedia today that the BBC supplies a news service which matches, even outstrips, the best of what is on offer from the States. Mills, however, appears to take a softer line than her organisation's chairman. Online News is, she admits, \"one of the world leaders, and it should be there.\" \"That is exactly the kind of thing they should be doing, even although there are head to head commercial operations, including ITN which is a member of Bipa.\" The problem arises where, she says, the BBC launches into areas where there is already fierce competition - like sport and, last year, into internet service provision with Freebeeb.net last year. That move sparked a flurry of protest both from rival ISPs and content providers, who feared the BBC's broadcasting channels could persuade large numbers of people to sign up for freebeeb.net then remain within the BBC's internet offering when they got online. Their fears were certainly not allayed by freebeeb.net's launch, given a little glitz by two of the stars of BBC Television's Top Gear programme. This, they said, was a perfect example of the BBC's brands and stars, built up by publicly funded channels, being used for commercial gain. In the end freebeeb.net - run by BBC Worldwide, the commercial part of the BBC not funded by the licence fee - has not proved the massive force in the UK ISP market that many feared, and cross-promotion has been limited. But, says Bipa, it is a good example of how the BBC's commercial and publicly funded online activities have to be monitored and carefully kept apart. Mills is reluctant to say what the BBC's role should be in the online world. \"I don't think it's up to me to decide what the BBC's role should be, but there should be a debate,\" she says. \"They should not be a national champion in the way that they seem to have been putting themselves forward, and in some ways as the government has supported them. There is no other European country which has a champion in this way. \"You hear them [the BBC] saying 'We're increasing internet usage' and I think that's rubbish - I think what will get people online is lower telco costs, cheaper PCs, better security and consumer confidence. The fact that the BBC is online is not going to get hordes of people using the internet. That is really misguided. \"The public service remit would have to be something of quality and worthy of the public funding, not interfering with the private sector too much.\" The BBC's response has been to point to the quality of its offering and the corporation's \"core values\" of information, education and entertainment. Nigel Chapman is the BBC's director of online, the non-commercial arm which includes news and that controversial sport site, but not BBC Worldwide's beeb.com and freebeeb.net. He says the BBC will not be put off from its aim to expand rapidly in the online world, with its continuing ambitions in this arena to be confirmed by the appointment of a new all-powerful director of new media within a few weeks. \"Online as a medium is here to stay, and is expanding very fast,\" he says. \"We know that in some groups - in particular young people - their consumption of traditional media falls as online usage expands. So you need to be in online to continue using all the weapons in your armoury and build relations with licence-fee payers in the United Kingdom.\" The theme of keeping up with licence-fee payers' migration to the webrecurs in Chapman's defence of the corporation's publicly funded activities online, and is one of the main reasons he insists: \"there is a special role for the BBC on the web\". \"Our new sports online site is a classic example of something that is strategically valuable to the BBC,\" he says. \"We need to reinforce the value of BBC sports to users, and it's extremely valuable because we have an awful lot of high-quality sports content - both audio, video and text and pictures - and a high standard of journalism. It's a situation where both the BBC and the licence-fee payers win. It's a perfect example of an area we should be in.\" But, as Sportal and the BBC's other sporting rivals ask, does the world need another sports site? Not surprisingly, he says yes, it does. \"I understand their fears, and I'm not surprised they see the BBC as a major competitor - it is a major competitor. But just because Sportal.com and everybody else is going into sport online doesn't mean the BBC should not be in it.\" Chapman says that much of the new site's content already exists, and it is the corporation's duty to make it available to licence-fee payers. \"I think it is really important that the BBC makes the most of its investment in sport. We have this material in the BBC already - it would be a pretty sad situation if we weren't allowed to use the internet as another platform for people to access it.\" Chapman also defends the news content deal between the BBC and Yahoo!, which prompted one commercial content distributor to say this week he had his head in his hands, asking \"why?\" The arrangement, he said, meant the biggest content site was in bed with the biggest portal: a formidable partnership that he felt any for-profit distributor would struggle to break through. Chapman says that is not so. \"The deal with Yahoo! is not an exclusive one. We are in discussions with other portals about something similar both for News Online and for other parts of BBC Online. It is not our ambition to give Yahoo! some marketplace advantage over other portals. Our ambition is to use our relationship with portals so that people who do not come direct to bbc.co.uk can see our material well presented in portals.\" He also gives short shrift to some more outspoken members of the UK's internet community who suggest that the BBC is, in fact, not as good at internet content as it - and others - think. \"All the indicators - both qualitative and quantitative - all the awards, all the traffic, the independent assessors - all of them say what a brilliant job the BBC has done in Online, and how pivotal it has been in creating a benchmark of quality,\" he says. \"We're not complacent - there's a lot more to do, and many areas we should be in that we are not. The issue of web television is to come. \"But in the narrow-band world in which most people live we have put a stake in the ground about quality, range and depth of content which, frankly, is not matched by anyone else in the UK market.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/jul/06/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-06T00:46:39Z","webTitle":"Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jul/06/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jul/06/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Notes and queries","bodyText":"I recently heard of Jeffrey Hudson, a 17th century \"dwarf\", who ran with the pirates, constantly duelled his detractors and was frequently presented to high society encased in a pie or a cake. Does anyone know more about him? * It is, perhaps, only right that Sir Jeffrey Hudson (1619-1682), England's smallest man, was born in England's smallest county, Rutland. The son of an Oakham butcher, Sir Jeffrey was normally proportioned but only 18 inches tall until well into middle age, when he \"grew\" to a height of 3ft 6ins. He came to the attention of Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I, when he was hidden inside a venison pie at a banquet in her honour held at the Duke of Buckingham's home near Oakham, where he was a page. He remained a loyal servant to the Queen and saw service during the civil war but, as a Catholic, was caught up in the panic surrounding the Popish Plot. After a spell in prison, he was released and lived off a pension supplied by the new Duke of Buckingham, the son of his first sponsor. There is a short (sic) biography of Sir Jeffrey in Aubrey's Brief Lives, and he was also written into one of Sir Walter Scott's lesser-known Waverley Novels, Peveril of the Peak, where his appearance and life are described in detail. The most famous painting of Sir Jeffrey is Van Dyke's Queen Henrietta Maria with Sir Jeffrey Hudson and an Ape, in the National Gallery, Washington DC. There are other portraits in a private collection near Oakham and at Petworth House in Sussex; his clothing can be seen at Sherborne Castle, Dorset; but the strangest artefact is a life-sized statue in the public bar of the Boat Inn in Portumna, County Galway. The house where Sir Jeffrey was born (The Dwarf's Cottage) has recently been given a blue plaque and, although it is privately owned and not open to the public, its traditional English garden will be opened this coming Sunday, July 9, as part of the festival Oakham in Bloom. Michael Walton, Pordenone, Italy. * In her contribution \"Some Famous Dwarfs\" to A Pageant of History (Collins, 1958), Frances Collingwood gives the following information: \"When the Queen [Henrietta Maria] fled to Paris, [Hudson] went with her and there fought two famous duels. The first was against a turkey cock and the second against a Mr Crofts. The man did not take his little opponent seriously and turned up armed only with a squirt. Sir Jeffrey, mounted on horseback to bring him up to Crofts' level, shot his opponent dead. Leaving Paris in a hurry, he tried to return to England, but pirates caught him in the Channel and he was sold into slavery.\" Mrs A A Hesson, Burnley, Lancs. Why are some countries, such as The Gambia, prefixed with \"The\", even when they are not plural (like The Netherlands). * It isn't a question of singular and plural. Some countries do not have true names but only descriptions (\"the United Kingdom\", \"the Czech Republic\", \"the Netherlands\", etc). As for \"the Gambia\" and \"the Congo\", they simply use the names of their main rivers (as if England were called \"the Trent\") - but then Uruguay is similarly named, and we don't call that \"the Uruguay\". A few take \"the\" purely by accident of language (\"the Ukraine\") and this applies to regions as well as countries: consider \"the Algarve\" and \"the Punjab\", but not \"the Tuscany\" or \"the Kosovo\". All in all, it's more or less random, like most things in language (and I live in the only town on earth whose English name takes \"the\"). Jim Burfield, The Hague, Netherlands. Is there any proof that homeopathic medicine works? * No, but the less proof there is, the more effectively it works. Les Killip, Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. * No properly conducted study has yet produced convincing evidence that it has any more value than a placebo. The Homeopathic Medicine Research Group, convened by the European Commission, examined 184 published and unpublished reports of controlled trials of homeopathic treatments. Its report (1996) concluded that only 17 of these trials were conducted well enough to be considered. While some may have demonstrated an effect greater than a placebo, overall the number of participants in the 17 trials was too small to permit any conclusions about the effectiveness of any given treatment for a specific condition. This is not surprising. The basic principles of homeopathy, laid down by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s (diseases are a manifestation of a \"psora\" or suppressed itch, the smaller the dose the greater the effect) have no demonstrable relationship with each other or with what we know about human biology. The only people for whom it could be said to \"work\" are hard-pressed GPs, who can pass their more persistent and intractable patients on to an \"alternative\" practioner, safe in the knowledge that no great harm is likely to be done. The best detailed critique of homeopathy is probably still Homeopathy and its Kindred Delusions, first delivered as two lectures by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1842. Michael Hutton, Camberwell, London SE5. * There are several levels of evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy, which has the best research profile of the alternative medical systems. Thoughtlessly disregarded by the scientific community is so-called \"anecdotal evidence\", the best of which includes reports of clinical experience by homeopathic doctors who have used conventional methods with less success. Taken together, this material suggests to a fair-minded observer that something interesting is taking place. Secondly, there is some good-quality historical evidence, particularly the experience of the American and European homeopathic hospitals in the 19th century, where mortality from infectious diseases like cholera was markedly lower than in conventional hospitals. In the modern period, the Society of Homeopaths has published reports on the work of members in primary care groups in the UK. Most importantly, a significant body of scientific literature, mainly reports of clinical trials, has accumulated over the past 20 years or so. Four meta-analyses have been published, and the broad agreement is that homeopathic medicines work well. Where there is still a lack of clarity is the question of how they work. Not that a lack of understanding of mechanism ever stopped drugs and therapies being introduced into orthodox medicine. Dr Denis MacEoin, chairman, The Natural Medicines Society, Newcastle upon Tyne. In the novel The Devil Rides Out, Dennis Wheatley refers to the \"Sussamma Ritual\" - the only one of his mythological references I have been unable to track down. Was it made up by the author? * William Hope Hodgson wrote a series of connected short stories, Carnacki the Ghost-Finder (1913) in which the eponymous hero investigated apparently supernatural events, some of which proved to have a natural explanation while others were genuine. The stories contained several motifs - protective pentacles, ancient manuscripts and rituals - found in later novels, including The Devil Rides Out (1935). In several of the stories, reference is made to the Saaamaaa Ritual, which has protective properties like the not dissimilar Sussamma Ritual. One may compare \"And then suddenly the Unknown Last Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual was whispered quite audibly in the room,\" (The Whistling Room, in Carnacki the Ghost-Finder) with \"In a clear, sharp voice he pronounced the last two lines of the dread Sussamma Ritual\" (The Devil Rides Out). Wheatley was familiar with Hodgson's work - he included one of his stories in an anthology he edited (A Century of Horror Stories, 1935) - and it has been suggested that Hodgson's novel, The Boats of the Glen Carrig, inspired Wheatley's Uncharted Seas. It is possible that the Sussamma Ritual was Wheatley's tribute to a writer whose work he admired. Brian Rolls, Reading, Berks. Why doesn't the government increase the price of fuel and abolish the annual vehicle road tax? * Because the road haulage industry would not be pleased. The annual road fund licence represents a huge cross-subsidy to the haulage industry from the ordinary motorist. Many years ago, the Transport Research Laboratory demonstrated that the damage to our roads caused by vehicles is proportional to the fourth power of the axle weight. As the road tax is raised to fund the building and repair of roads, this would mean that, if the cost was shared equitably, for every £100 paid by the motorist, the owner of a heavy lorry would have to pay at least £1m - and that figure does not take into account the higher annual mileage of the lorry. In the short term, making road hauliers pay their full \"track\" costs would boost inflation, but in the longer term it might enable rail freight to compete on a level playing field. Roger Wood, Breachwood Green, Herts. Why do wasps and bees hover round the outside of windows trying to get in, and then hover round the inside trying to get out? * Perhaps the glass is cleaner on the other side of the sill.

The new lead-replacement petrol is still 5p per litre more than unleaded. Who gets the extra 5p? Jo Duncan, Bromley, Kent.

The decision to send in the troops in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary came after four successive nights of loyalist violence across the province, in support of the Orange Order's demand to be allowed to march along the nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown. Security spokesmen in Northern Ireland insist that there will be no return to routine military patrolling, and that the few hundred soldiers involved will be deployed at trouble spots, especially the 'front lines' between loyalist and nationalist areas. There are less than 10,000 regular soldiers in Northern Ireland today, not including the full and part-time locally recruited members of the Royal Irish Rangers. At the peak of the Troubles in the 1970s, more than 22,000 British troops served in the province, most of them on short tours of four to six months at a time. The first troops were deployed in August 1969, when the RUC and its notorious reserve force of B Specials failed to control republican rioting in Derry. At first, they were greeted as protectors by the Catholic population. All that changed when the old Unionist government in Stormont insisted that the troops be used to suppress the IRA. From 1970, and especially after the introduction of internment without trial in 1971, the army was engaged in a brutal campaign against the republican paramilitary movement, spearheaded by the Provisional IRA. It has also from time to time been embroiled in ugly battles with the various loyalist paramilitary groups. Gunner Robert Curtis, the first of more than 400 soldiers to die in Northern Ireland, was shot in the staunchly Protestant Shankill Road in Belfast in February 1971. In the early days, the top brass was appalled to be involved in a police action, within the United Kingdom. But it quickly became apparent that Northern Ireland was the army's best training ground, for ordinary infantry and for special units alike. The constant danger of patrolling and garrisoning nationalist areas instilled discipline and teamwork. It allowed the development of new techniques, for example in surveillance and bomb disposal. It also spawned a new military jargon, as the planners worked on the new concept of 'low intensity operations'. Though the generals and staff officers quickly latched on to the usefulness of Northern Ireland, most squaddies loathed it. It wasn't a hardship post for the few battalions which served two-year tours in long established military barracks, accompanied by their families. But for the majority on four-month tours it was deeply uncomfortable as well as deadly dangerous. One of the early makeshift barracks in central Belfast was literally a bombsite, the remains of an old hotel. Another was a crumbling, derelict factory in Hastings Street, the target of many an IRA sniper. In Derry, units were housed in ancient Nissan huts, while others were cooped up in a hastily fortified abandoned garage in the heart of the hostile Creggan estate. Perhaps the worst outpost was the hugely sandbagged and steel-plated police station in Crossmaglen - XMG to the officer-class - in South Armagh, known to all ranks as cowboy country. Patrolling the mine- and sniper-infested country around Crossmaglen was so dangerous that soldiers were helicoptered in and out of the police station compound. Even the rubbish was sent out by air. Though it is more than five years since the IRA and the main loyalist paramilitaries declared their first ceasefires, there will be no shortage of serving soldiers with experience of active operations in Northern Ireland. Perhaps some of them will be exhilarated by the prospect of more of the same. The majority, almost certainly, will be deeply depressed.

Then the Maoist rebels who have been fighting the Nepalese state for four years fled to a nearby village. The police caught up with them there. Six rebels unwisely took shelter in a house. The police set light to it. In the gun battle that followed all the rebels were shot dead except one - 17-year-old Bhagwati Chaudhary. According to human rights agencies, the police interrogated her, then shot her. That summary execution last month is just the latest example of extra-judicial killing in Nepal. Since 1996 the authorities have been struggling to contain the growing communist insurgency in the remote middle west of what was once a peaceful Himalayan kingdom. At least 1,500 people have been killed, two-thirds of them by the Nepalese police. \"We have very clear evidence that extra-judicial killing is going on,\" Krishna Pahadi of the Human Rights and Peace Society said. \"If the police suspect someone of being a Maoist, they simply kill them.\" The situation has become so grave that the European Union recently intervened for the first time, urging the Nepalese government not to violate human rights and to begin talks with the Maoist rebels. Nepal's hardline prime minister, Girja Koirala, who came to power in March advocating a military solution to the Maoist problem, now appears to have responded to international pressure. \"There is no alternative to talks,\" he said. But his critics say he is not serious about negotiation. The Maoist guerrillas have also been responsible for a series of outrages. Two months ago the rebels beheaded a suspected informer, leaving the victim's head in a tree. Last month they killed 21 people, including 12 policemen, during a gunfight in the Jarjarkot district of western Nepal. They have ruthlessly eliminated supporters of the ruling Nepali Congress and other rival parties. About 1.5m of Nepal's 20m people now live under their control, in what amounts to a de facto state run from the hill district of Rolpa. Active also in several districts in the east of Nepal, they have an army of between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, armed with home-made guns and primitive bombs. Successive governments in Kathmandu have been slow to respond to the crisis. Last month 150 refugees from the west of Nepal arrived in Kathmandu after a gruelling 26-day trek, seeking government protection. They say that their MPs are now too scared to live in the districts they represent. \"We have become victims of both police and Maoist guerrillas. In the eyes of the police, we are the supporters of Maoists, and in the eyes of Maoist guerrillas we are informers to the police,\" Him Bahadur Budha, from Rolpa, said. The insurgency is masterminded by Prachanda, the general secretary of the underground Maoist Communist party. His aim is to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and replace it with a Maoist republic. The group, which began its uprising in February 1996, has links with other revolutionary groups. In Maoist villages, where the red flag flies, Prachanda has introduced collective farming. His cadres collect taxes and impose justice. Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a former MP who has been asked by the prime minister to negotiate with the rebels, said last weekend that he was \"pessimistic\" that the conflict could be swiftly resolved. Before sitting down to talks, the Maoists want the police to account for more than 40 supporters who have disappeared while in custody. Before his government collapsed under the pressure of the Maoist problem, the former prime minister Krishna Bhattarai said that many of the detainees had been executed without trial. The Maoists' paper, Janesh, recently conceded that some members had grown corrupt. The movement was going through a period of \"critical self-evaluation\", it said. But in many areas the Maoists continue to enjoy a high level of popular support. In the village of Kara, for example, which the police burned to the ground last year, the son of a prominent politician kidnapped by the Maoists has been put to work as a stonemason. Pitamber Sharma, of the Integrated Centre for Mountain Development, said last weekend that only economic reform could stop the insurgency. \"In the mountains, 60-65 per cent live below the poverty line. There is no electricity, no television and no transport,\" he said. \"I don't see any prospect of the Maoists taking over Nepal. But if conditions continue as they do, we are going to create a situation of protracted civil war.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/jul/07/emu.theeuro","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-07T02:40:35Z","webTitle":"Cook fuels new euro row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/07/emu.theeuro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jul/07/emu.theeuro","fields":{"headline":"Cook fuels new euro row","bodyText":"Downing Street today attempted to quell the latest political storm to break over the government's euro policy, insisting that it was not a foregone conclusion that Britain would join. The intervention by the prime minister's spokesman was seen as a direct rebuke to the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, after he had suggested British membership was \"inevitable\". Mr Cook's unscripted remarks to trade unionists on Thursday night threatened to reopen divisions among cabinet ministers as to how quickly Britain should be moving towards joining the single currency. The foreign secretary's observation appeared to gain credence after comments by the European Central Bank president, Wim Duisenberg, who said that Britain had now met most of the conditions for joining the euro and was \"suffering greatly\" by staying outside. \"The United Kingdom satisfies all the conditions for entry, except that of the exchange rate,\" he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. \"The performance of the British economy is admirable, but it is suffering greatly because it is not participating in the euro. That said, the decision is for the British people.\" Mr Cook, together with Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and trade secretary Stephen Byers, has been pressing to start campaigning for the euro before the general election - a move strongly resisted by Chancellor Gordon Brown. Downing Street however insisted that while it was still the government's aim to take Britain into the euro, the economic conditions had to be right before it would recommend membership in a referendum. \"It's our objective to join a successful single currency, providing the economic conditions are met. It is not inevitable, but it's our objective,\" the spokesman said. Mr Cook's comments came in a question-and-answer session after a speech in which he had stuck rigidly to the official line that the government's five economic tests had to be met before it would recommend signing up. However, in response to questions, he pointed out that opinion polls showed that the majority of people in the country believed it was \"inevitable\" Britain would join, adding: \"I think they are right.\" His remarks coincided with some of the most pro-euro comments to date from Tony Blair during his appearance on BBC Question Time. The prime minister said that, if the economy continued on its present track, the government would be able to recommend joining in a referendum early in the next parliament. He warned that if the impression was given that Britain was not prepared to sign up to the single currency, inward investment would start declining \"virtually overnight\". Mr Brown, meanwhile, was determinedly standing aside from the latest row, flatly refusing to answer journalists' questions about Mr Cook's remarks at a press briefing today on third-world debt relief. \"I am not here to do a press conference on the euro,\" he said. Earlier this week, however, he insisted that the economic tests would be assessed \"rigorously\" before the government would consider putting the question of British membership to the public in a referendum. Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said the government was in a \"state of disarray\" over the single currency. \"Downing Street spin doctors have launched a panic rearguard action to try to cover up Robin Cook's remarks when he confirmed that the Labour government want to scrap the pound,\" he said. \"Ministers are not only committed to the euro in principle, but believe membership is inevitable. Their outlook for Britain is defeatist. They ignore the evidence that Britain can survive and thrive outside the euro.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jul/08/northernireland.johnmullin1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-08T00:16:30Z","webTitle":"50,000 join Joey Dunlop on last lap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/08/northernireland.johnmullin1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jul/08/northernireland.johnmullin1","fields":{"headline":"50,000 join Joey Dunlop on last lap","bodyText":"David McGee peeled back his leathers and rolled up his sleeve to reveal his tribute. There, tattoed on his forearm, was the motorcyling legend Joey Dunlop, in trademark yellow helmet with black stripe, riding his Honda No 3. Mr McGee, 27, a well-built fisherman from Killybegs across the Irish border in Co Donegal, was hardly the type with whom anyone would choose to trifle. So it was strangely affecting to see him quickly turn away, embarrassed, to avert his brimming eyes. He was in good company in Ballymoney, Co Antrim, yesterday. Hundreds of hard men cried, and most did so without shame. Northern Ireland hosted its largest funeral in almost 20 years yesterday in a staggering tribute to a man scarely known outside his native land or the world of motorcycle racing. Police expected 50,000 to turn up, and think that was an underestimate. Protests over the Drumcree stand-off even came to a halt yesterday as heads were bowed in tribute. Motorcyclists began arriving at dawn, from as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Africa, and they rode in noisy formation, turning the air blue with exhaust fumes. So many stood in the tiny country lanes around Dunlop's modest bungalow that when the cortege finally moved off, it was impossible to move. As Dunlop began his last lap to the tiny Garryduff Presbyterian church, the applause began, tentatively at first. It was to ripple every step of the way, as the undertakers took an hour to carry him through the suffocating crowds and complete the mile-long trip. Alan Watts, 31, a builder from Sligo, tried to explain. \"Joey Dunlop was extraordinary, yet still remained ordinary. He was the most brilliant of motorcycle road-racers ever - we all know that - but he remained the same down-to-earth guy. \"I saw him last at the Isle of Man TT races three weeks ago, when he was under real pressure, and he still had time for everyone. He was welcoming fans into the paddock and chatting happily with them. Dunlop, 48, was the last of the so-called Armoy Armada to die. His friends Mervyn Robinson and Frank Kennedy, the other members of the trio named after the nearby village where they were brought up, died in races long ago, and many thought Dunlop indestructible. He died last Sunday at a road race in Tallin, Estonia, two weeks after he won a hat-trick of races at the Isle of Man TT, taking his tally to 26 victories since 1977. Ballymoney civic leaders granted him a civic reception and crowds clapped him around the town as he toured in an open-topped bus. He was faintly embarrassed, and his eyes were glistening as he said nothing could get any better than this. David Cretney, the Isle of Man's tourism minister, turned up then, all chuckles as he announced an honorary knighthood for Dunlop. He broke down yesterday as he delivered the funeral eulogy. Dunlop's racing career began in 1969. He won five world championships and hundreds of races. Dunlop's final victory came in a 600cc race in Tallin a week ago, and he was out in front on his 125cc when he lost control the next day and smashed into a tree. He died instantly. Northern Ireland loves road-racing, the only place it is allowed in the United Kingdom, but they adore a people's champion even more. Dunlop's pub, Joey's Bar, was festooned with flowers yesterday. Bikers queued to lay tributes and read messages left by others as Linda Dunlop and her five children buried their husband and father. His cortege had been delayed for six hours as it ran into road blocks throughout Northern Ireland on Tuesday night. Mrs Dunlop, in the church where she and her childhood sweetheart had recently renewed their marital vows on their silver wedding anniversary, listened as John Kirkpatrick, honorary chaplain to the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland, paid handsome tribute to his friend. In victory, he was self-effacing, and in defeat, generous. But mourners were instead recalling Dunlop's own words. He said in his understated way: \"I never really wanted to be a superstar. I just wanted to be myself. \"I hope people remember me that way.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jul/08/filmnews.film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-08T00:31:19Z","webTitle":"Film director Lee spikes Patriot's guns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/08/filmnews.film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/08/filmnews.film","fields":{"headline":"Film director Lee spikes Patriot's guns","bodyText":"Spike Lee, America's best-known and most outspoken black film director, has accused the makers of The Patriot, a film about the fight for American independence, of producing a criminally distorted view of history. He has attacked the film for ignoring the issues of slavery and mocked its finale as \"laughable\". Lee's broadside against the film which stars Mel Gibson and opened in the United States for the July 4 weekend came in the form of an angry letter to the Hollywood Reporter, the entertainment industry's daily. He said that he and his wife had gone to see the film and that he had come out of the cinema \"fuming\" after having to hold himself back from shouting at the screen. He wrote that the founding fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned numerous slaves yet Mel Gibson's character apparently was not a slaveholder. He called the film \"pure, blatant American Hollywood propaganda\". Lee, the director of Malcolm X, Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever among many others, has often attacked the Hollywood ethos of film-making but rarely in such a specific way. Some feel he has suffered for his plain-speaking by being overlooked for film honours despite high praise for Malcolm X. \"When talking about the history of this great country,\" he wrote, \"one can never forget that America was built upon the genocide of the Native Americans and the enslavement of African people. To say otherwise is criminal. \"DW Griffith was a racist and Leni Riefenstahl a 'so-called reformed Nazi' but the Birth of a Nation and Triumph of the Will were made by great film-makers. To have Gibson's character doing a one-man Iwo Jima broken-field run through the 'Nazi'-like British with the 13-star American flag held high is laughable.\" (Earlier this year, the prestigious director's prize named after DW Griffith had its name changed because of his racist views and the fact that the Birth of A Nation had acted as a recruiting agent for the Ku Klux Klan.) Lee said that he kept wondering where the slaves were and who was picking the cotton. \"Where were the Native Americans? Did the two Johns - Ford and Wayne - wipe them out already? Why have the film critics ignored this in their reviews?\" While the film has attracted some criticism for the way in which most of the Britons are portrayed as sadistic child-killers while the American militiamen are largely saintly, as well as for the violence which involves children using guns on the British troops, Lee's attack is the first from a leading figure in the industry. It follows attacks from the United Kingdom about the way the history of the second world war is gradually being rewritten to give Americans a more prominent role in key events. The Patriot, which has won many critical plaudits for the British actor Jason Isaacs as a magnificently amoral British commander, has done reasonably well in its first week although it was somewhat swamped by the opening over the same weekend of The Perfect Storm, which realistically recreates a true story of fishermen caught at sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2000/jul/08/weekend.kevintoolis1","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-08T11:10:06Z","webTitle":"Little boy blue (part two)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jul/08/weekend.kevintoolis1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jul/08/weekend.kevintoolis1","fields":{"headline":"Little boy blue (part two)","bodyText":"Back at the hotel, there are more interviews. The Police Federation speech has led the One OÕClock News, and run big in the London Evening Standard. But there is trouble brewing. Straight away, the political editor of the Scottish Sun wants a line on the Mike Tyson row that has exploded into a constitutional battle between the Scottish Parliament, which wants to ban the convicted rapist from boxing in Scotland, and Jack Straw, who wonÕt exclude Tyson from the United Kingdom. The Tyson story is in danger of wiping out HagueÕs visit to Scotland as a news item. There is a brief discussion about what line to take. There is no line, and Hague refuses to comment. Within a few minutes, the Scottish Sun man closes his notebook. Later, Amanda Platell explains the decision: if they comment on Tyson, theyÕll just become part of the Tyson story. As it turns out, the Tyson row does kill media interest in HagueÕs visit Ñ even the Scottish broadsheets relegate the story to page nine; the Scottish Sun carries nothing. Soon, we are back on the road again, to the Eastwood constituency dinner for Spanish melon, roast sirloin of beef and a rousing campaign speech by William for the 225 £25-a-head members and guests at the concrete 60s Normandy Hotel, in the suburbs of Glasgow. ItÕs another stage for Hague, glad-handing, greeting, frozen smiles and pictures with a whole queue of Tory council candidates. Later, after his speech, as part of some other ritual, he will walk around alone and introduce himself to each table of seated diners. The road to Downing Street, it seems, is paved with social excruciation. Hague is an accomplished public speaker. His delivery is good, the comic timing spot on, and the cadences of rhetoric just right. He is a master of the big set-piece conference platform speech; his hands wave, he declaims, he cajoles. Tonight is a walk-over. Like all good after-dinner speakers, he starts off warming up the audience with a few jokes from old newspaper headlines Ñ \"Home Secretary to act on Porn Video\" Ñ and then hits with his big theme: Tony Blair is a fraud and the fortunes of the Tory Party can be revived. He is scathing: \"I know our chief opponent very well, because I have to ask him those questions every Wednesday afternoon. I have to get into the way he thinks, think the way he thinks, and how he will answer those questions. I know that he does not believe in anything at all. At the last election, that gave him an advantage; at the next election, it gives us an advantage.\" It was my first Conservative dinner, and it was a shock. The Party is old; most of the dinner guests were in their 70s. It was hard to believe that this Britain Ñ bouffant hair-dos, portly, uniformed chauffeurs, crinoline ball-gowns and floral prints Ñ still existed; Planet Tory. It was like stepping back into the 50s. One thing was sure, these people would not be knocking door to door at election time. At one table at the back was a small clique of young men from Glasgow UniversityÕs Conservative Society. They are strangely awkward, arrogant, odd-looking, dressed in clothes borrowed from their grandparents; young Williams revisited 20 years later. Hague is not a fretter. He sleeps soundly. He is genuinely confident and relentlessly optimistic about both the ToriesÕ and his own prospects. He runs the Tory party like a company. Meetings are short, brisk and decisive. He does not like endless argument, and when he reaches a position, he sticks with it. \"I like to hear the argument and then decide Ñ just sleep on it and know. ItÕs the same asking questions of the Prime Minister. Sometimes you can sit for hours thinking about the issues you could ask him about and working it all out Ñ the moves on the chessboard, as it were. But, actually, usually when IÕve really pinned him to the wall, itÕs when IÕve woken up that morning and thought of something Ñ that is going to be the thing I nail him on today.\" In the morning, he does more radio and then drives to the outskirts of Edinburgh for a press conference on todayÕs theme: keeping the pound. ItÕs been raining, the hotel is cold, miserable. ItÕs a poor turnout from the press: Tyson 1, Hague 0. Clustered in a corner are another batch of the men who characteristically make up the political class of Britain. They stand around and smile, but their eyes are full of hunger for the glitter of attention as they watch the Leader being interviewed, again and again, by the few reporters who do turn up. The dominant emotion is not awe but envy. Among them stands Malcolm Rifkind, shorn of his former grandeur of power. He reminds me for all the world of my old Edinburgh dentist. ItÕs hard to believe he was once the British Foreign Secretary, and these the remnants of a political party that once ruled Britain. Hague is at home in this world, as much a creature of the Conservative Party as he is his fatherÕs son. He inherited his politics from his father, Nigel, an instinctive Yorkshire Tory who ran a small soft-drinks company, Charles Hague &amp; Sons, manufacturing lemonade. Ironically, Hague is the first Tory leader ever to have gone to a state school. He was educated at Wath-on-Dearne Comprehensive in Rotherham, Yorkshire, whose social mix included the sons of miners and steelworkers, after rejecting a scholarship to a state boarding school, Ripon Grammar, 30 miles from home. Hague got four As at A-Level and went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in, predictably, Politics, Philosophy and Economics, as well as being president of the Oxford Union. He has a further diploma from the prestigious INSEAD French institute. For five years, Hague was a management consultant with McKinsey, but that was just his day job. According to his CV, even as he worked at McKinsey, he was already political adviser to Geoffrey Howe and Leon Brittan in the Thatcher Government. His line about his life outside politics sounds just like that, a line. \"I have seen life from many different angles. I have not had a privileged upbringing. I learned more delivering beer round the working men clubÕs in Rotherham when I was a teenager than I learned at Oxford.\" Bill Clinton, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair also spent their entire lives training for political office, but HagueÕs resum\u008e is narrower: he started out as a political altar boy and he has single-mindedly devoted his entire life to the Conservative party from the age of 15. His family nickname was \"Tory boy\", and he was chairman of the Rother Valley Young Conservatives at the grand old age of 16. His infamous speech was delivered to the 1977 Blackpool Tory conference two years before Thatcher entered Downing Street. In many ways, Hague has been giving the same speech ever since. \"As a 16-year-old, I represent what may well seem to be the last generation for the Conservative Party. That lack of support stems largely from the fact that the party is seen, rightly or wrongly, as standing for the maintenance of the existing political and economic order. The young people who voted so overwhelmingly against our party last time are people who believe in change Ñ not change for changeÕs sake, but because they are dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs in Great Britain.They want a society where effort and initiative are rewarded instead of being stamped on Ñ most of all they want to be free from the government, the government that they think should get out of their lives . . . if we rise to the challenge and if we determine to roll back the frontier for the state, we will not only capture the imagination of younger people, we will save free enterprise and Great Britain and create a capital-owning, home-owning democracy.\" Part of his strength, and his weakness, is this monumental belief in the Conservative cause. His fundamental political position is simple: the Tories should be in power always. From time to time, most of us wonder what it would be like to be a politician, but few of us, I think, could bear the price, the mind-numbing repetition of policy and belief, the wasted hours in wasted argument in dead committee rooms, the incremental advantage of this alliance instead of that alliance, the hanging around in the company of the warped, the fanatic, the politically ambitious. It requires extraordinary self-discipline and a sectarian passion for self-promotion. There is no doubt that Hague qualifies on both counts. \"It helps if you enjoy being the centre of attention, being at the centre of events, and you donÕt mind everything being public in your life. I have always enjoyed that, or not minded it. It helps if you enjoy giving speeches, and setting out positions. There is an element of being an actor in there, without being completely taken over by being an actor. I think there is a bit of all that in me.\" William Hague, I am pretty sure, was never much of an ordinary human being. His unadulterated devotion to his political cause raises uncomfortable questions about his very suitability for the office to which he aspires. Is there a real William Hague underneath the latest policy positions? Is there a warm human being behind the grin of the accomplished debater? His passion for politics seems to leave space for little else. He has the air of a man not overly concerned with money or luxurious living. His clothes look inexpensive, even if theyÕre not. His London base is a flat in Dolphin Square and he has another flat in a stately home in his Yorkshire constituency. In a belated bid to humanise his trainspotter image, Hague has taken up judo, revealed his passion for cross-country skiing and, most famously, got married to Ffion Jenkins, in December 1997. For years he has been dogged by rumours in the Westminster village that he is gay (despite the fact that he had a girlfriend when, in 1987, he first set his sights on the Richmond constituency, some 70 miles north of his home town) Ñ rumours that he has denied on the record. But, with a beautiful wife by his side, he is now, in the textbook Tory leader script, a happily married, firmly-founded, individual. \"I do not intend to lose. But when you have the home, family, wife, interests that I have, there is no need to fear losing,\" he says. But, despite the image make-over, Hague remains an enigma. FfionÕs presence, 300 public engagements later, has not softened his monastic, geeky image. Close observers say their relationship is joshy, schoolboy/ schoolgirl flirtatious, but their marriage remains a rigidly private matter, as closed off as the inner recesses of HagueÕs own self. In this respect, the contrast with the Ford Galaxy-driving First Family Blair, and the patter of LeoÕs little feet, could not be more pointed. We move on to the local Currie High School. Aides, camera crews, Hague, other politicians, teachers Ñ a party of around 20 Ñ squeezing our way into a couple of classrooms in search of the elusive photo opportunity. The kids seem more frightened than curious, worried that the wrong remark might spell trouble. We end up downstairs in the library for a question-and-answer session with the sixth form. The kids are 16 to 18 and show a healthy disrespect for the politician in front of them. Hague launches straight into a sectarian defence of the Conservative position. ItÕs just another hustings. The kidsÕ questions are predictable: crime, asylum, the battle over the repeal of Section 28, the clause that supposedly bans local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools. In Scotland, LabourÕs plans to repeal the clause have proved to be a political disaster. The actual meaning of the Section 28 clause has long ceased to have any direct relevance to the storm of accusation and counter-accusation unleashed by the privately-funded \"referendum\" and Scottish Cardinal Thomas WinningÕs denunciation of \"perverts\". The Scottish Tory Party is strongly opposed to the clauseÕs repeal, despite well-founded media whispers that a number of prominent Scots Tories are themselves closet gays. HagueÕs answer is another little masterpiece, coating a reactionary stance in an outer layer of seeming tolerance. \"I am not saying that everyone should live in a particular way. I think we should be tolerant of people having different sexual orientations. We have got past all the attitudes that everyone has to live in a particular way. But that does not mean taxpayersÕ money should be used to promote a particular lifestyle. That is a separate issue. In our party, you will find people of a different sexual orientation who will agree about Section 28. The great majority of the public also agree about Section 28. Politicians have to respect issues like that.\" But, for all the clever sophistry of his answer, HagueÕs mini-hustings at Currie High School revealed not the depth but the limitations of his repertoire. He repeated a few jokes and the kids laughed, once or twice, but there was not any sense of connection. William did not enthuse, he did not inspire, he does not even pretend to give the standard political argument about politics, democracy and why, in an era of democratic apathy, the kids should bother voting for anyone. It was a telling moment. It is an argument that Hague is constitutionally incapable of enunciating; the blood in his veins runs so Tory blue that he would rather the sixth-formers of Currie High School stayed at home on polling day than vote Labour. To the private consternation of some of his staff, Hague does not even recognise his omission. The instincts of the Conservative battling debater can take you only so far. You also have to have the \"vision thing\". We head off towards a Keep the Pound Rally in Princes Street gardens, and serious opposition. The rally has attracted about 200 people, including a large contingent of Socialist WorkerÕs Party hecklers. Their posters are festooned with images of Hague under the banner: \"Stop this man playing the race card!\" Hague takes the platform mike and sticks it to Blair. \"All the opinion polls show that the vast majority of British people agree with us that we should be in Europe, but keep the pound. That is why, as part of our Common Sense Revolution, we have issued a Sterling Guarantee that means that people can be sure that a vote for the Conservative Party at the next election is a vote to keep the pound.\" As his aides crowd in on the SWP banner-holders, Hague takes questions. He is again a man at ease, enjoying the rollicking argument, the cut and thrust of hostile questions, and the soap-box politics. It is a genuine democratic moment. ItÕs not every day the citizens of Edinburgh get the chance in person to ask the Leader of the Opposition questions. At the end, we all get ready to slip away, but then the SWP contingent starts running after us in a pincer movement to block our exit up the steep embankment that leads to Princes Street. \"Stuff the racists, end the fear. Refugees are welcome here,\" they shout. What starts out as a brisk walk soon becomes a hurried trot. We make it through the narrow metal exit to Princes Street, once again a hurtling, 30-strong phalanx of human bodies. We dash over the road in front of hooting buses, but our pursuers follow. \"Hague, you are a disgrace!\" shouts one persistent Sinn Fein advocate of the Good Friday Agreement. We are chased along half the length of Princess Street to the refuge of Scottish Conservative Office, being spat at and abused. Once inside, everyone cracks jokes about jogging and trades heckler stories. There is a real air of relief as the Leader and his followers sit down for beer and lunch. Soon Hague will be off for another appointment in his constituency, another stage on what will, or will not, be his road to No10. Will William Hague become Prime Minister? Two months ago, the answer would have been easy Ñ no. He did not have a chance. Now that answer is less certain, and the battle lines are clearer. But I am still not really sure who William Hague is. The hours I spent in his company revealed not the substance of a man but rather the internal working of a political machine. The person inside that machine remained as remote and untouchable as that flickering image in our memories of the Tory Boy Wonder. There is only one certainty. William Hague is going to fight the next election in the only way he knows how, as a real Tory, not one of the fake, soppy, compassionate ones, and he is fighting to win."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2000/jul/08/features1","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-08T13:48:34Z","webTitle":"Our father, who art in LA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/08/features1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jul/08/features1","fields":{"headline":"Our father, who art in LA","bodyText":"Hollywood and Christians stare at one another across an apparently unbridgeable abyss. Hollywood, which once spent millions on religious themes and Biblical epics, now regards the largely southern, largely Baptist, frequently barmy, often bellicose Religious Right as little more than a bunch of ranting, snake-handling hillbillies. The Christians, by contrast, have long conceived of Los Angeles as a swamp of moral squalor, a New Sodom, pumping secular-humanist filth into the ears and eyes of America's children, along with slanderous depictions of Christians. In recent years, fundamentalists haven't shied away from issuing detailed edicts concerning what movies should and shouldn't show. They salt their diatribes with plausibly deniable anti-Semitism, misogyny and homophobia, and never, ever stop smiling. And they wonder why Hollywood doesn't write them a blank cheque? \"They slammed doors in my face for five years,\" says Christian movie producer Matthew Crouch, who tried to find studio backing for his millennial religious thriller The Omega Code. Crouch discovered that in Hollywood Christians are perceived as tiresome, censor-happy moralists, and as manic boycotters who don't even go to the movies. If they aren't buying tickets, reason the studio accountants, why placate them? Crouch and others have come to see that Hollywood isn't really anti-God, it's just a lot more pro-Mammon. Therefore, Christian movie producers have slowly been working to feed their flock the righteous images they hunger and thirst after so ardently. Crouch argues that last year's success of The Omega Code, starring Michael York, Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenburg - a sequel is now in production - proves that Christians can form an important part of the paying movie audience. A Christian movie community has started to define itself. First there is considerable financial backing available from fundamentalist churches and broadcasters themselves. Then there's the huge captive audience that shows up in church every Sunday, and which can see Christian movie trailers between the lesson and the second hymn. Producers are now organising all-Christian film festivals to showcase their material, such as the Annual Central Coast Christian in Salinas, California, which celebrates its fourth birthday in December. Last year's entrants ranged from the promisingly named Rich Christiano's coming-of-age drama End Of The Harvest to an end-of-the-world sci-fi thriller like Revelation, starring Jeff Fahey (and Revelation is the sequel to another home-made success, Apocalypse, which cleaned up on the tabernacle circuit a couple of years ago). \"It's pure evangelism,\" says festival organiser Tom Saab, a real estate investor who held his first festival seven years ago in Salem, New Hampshire - the town where Christians once burned witches so enthusiastically. \"We simply wanted to bring the Gospel into a secular setting.\" Only a tiny number of independently made Christian movies have secured national distribution, let alone success, because preaching always seems to take precedence over production values. That resulted in po-faced mini-hits like 1965's The Restless Ones (about underage pregnancy), the drama A Thief In The Night (1972), and The Cross And The Switchblade - starring Pat Boone and Erik Estrada - a thriller about a priest in a Puerto Rican ghetto. A change was detectable after the straight-to-video success of Apocalypse, made for a million dollars by biblical-sounding brothers Peter and Paul Lalonde, who were originally inspired by viewing Raiders Of The Lost Ark. \"Apocalypse was the clarion call,\" says Peter Lalonde. \"It was the breakthrough success that started the revival of Christian film-making.\" It's been followed by Revelation ($5 million budget) and Tribulation ($9 million), starring Gary Busey and Howie Long, another dream cast. The recent films by and large eschew the bloodbags and nude scenes that sane moviegoers crave, and inevitably there is a good deal of wall-eyed evangelical fervour standing between the viewer and any chance of a good time. The majority, including Omega and the Lalonde brothers' work, unfold in the countdown to the \"Rapture\" or \"End Time\" that fundamentalists believe heralds the arrival of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and rely heavily on groaning scripts, Biblical references, cheesy special effects and ropey acting. If you don't already believe, the movies won't persuade you to reanoint yourself in the blood of the Lamb. \"This is a consumer group that Madison Avenue, Wall Street and Hollywood have not recognised,\" says Crouch, the son of religious broadcasters Paul and Jan Crouch, who run the Trinity Broadcasting Network that is based, improbably enough, in Los Angeles. They're the hosts of religious TV show Praise The Lord, a traditional, money-grubbing televangelical guiltfest which they inherited from its comically corrupt founders, the sexually confused Jim Bakker and his surgically enhanced Barbie-doll wife, Tammy. (The Bakkers' operatic rapacity and financial malfeasance earned PTL the nickname Pass The Loot, and the Bakkers later went to hell in a maelstrom of tax-evasion suits and sex scandals.) With the backing of Trinity - which receives $80 million per year in \"viewer contributions\" from trailer-park shut-ins and retirement home reactionaries - Crouch made The Omega Code in Jerusalem, Rome and Los Angeles, spending a mere $7.2 million to make a movie that would have cost a studio five times as much. Omega came in 10th at the box office on the weekend it was released, but took more money per screen than the number-one movie, Fight Club. Hollywood paid attention. \"Buying that seven-dollar ticket is a vote that will help decide what happens in Hollywood,\" says Crouch. \"Movie theatres are a place now for nudging people to be receptive about the Kingdom.\" Evangelical movie promoter Phillip Hull agrees. He was involved in the innovative, congregation-based marketing strategy that ensured a large and devout audience for Omega. \"We decided we wanted to be involved because we wanted to send Hollywood a message that there are folks out here who are tired of the sex and the drugs and the blatant violence.\" Although there were a couple of shootings in Omega, he says, \"it doesn't show any of the normal Hollywood entrance-wound and exit-wound junk.\" Much of Hull's work involved securing endorsements from pastors and religious broadcasters. TBN was running excerpts and trailers for a year before Omega's release. Some pastors bought out entire shows for their congregations. Meanwhile, Christian PR firm Providence Entertainment is helping the Lalonde brothers finance the most expensive Christian film to date, Left Behind: The Movie, a $17 million adaptation of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins' successful after-the-Rapture thriller. Providence claims a potential Christian movie audience of 70 million, but the evidence suggests that the film-makers are largely preaching to the converted. Apart from the Omega Code, none of these movies has played nationally in mainstream cinemas. Most are projected in church buildings, Sunday schools, at religious summer camps or in the houses and trailer homes of devout followers of religious broadcasters. Apocalypse and End Of The Harvest are seen in ghetto storefront churches, Southern Baptist congregations, in suburban places of worship and in the gigantic, drive-in Crystal Cathedrals one finds in Texas and Southern California. After the screening the preacher will often ask the children present to mount the stage below the screen and pledge their souls anew to the Big Man Upstairs. Thankfully, you won't catch these movies - or this kind of mindless indoctrination - at your local megaplex or mall. Not yet. But watch the heavens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2000/jul/09/personalfinancenews.business3","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-08T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"Sterling value of hi-tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jul/09/personalfinancenews.business3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jul/09/personalfinancenews.business3","fields":{"headline":"Sterling value of hi-tech","bodyText":"Anyone looking for clarification on British attitudes to the single currency should be none the wiser after the events of last week. On almost all the key issues - the Government's position on entry timing, whether it is in British industry's interest to join and, crucially, what inward investors think - the picture appears more muddled than ever. At the centre of the confusion are the figures produced by Invest UK, formerly the Invest in Britain Bureau, last Wednesday. These show record levels of new inward investment, creating 52,783 jobs and 757 projects and bringing £47.4 billion foreign investment into the UK. As Eurosceptics speedily pointed out, these do not tally with statements from ministers such as Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook claiming inward investors are increasingly nervous of Britain's wait-and-see attitude to the single currency. Adding to the confusion were the two high-level leaks - a memo to Byers from the head of Invest UK, Andrew Fraser, and a diplomatic telegram from the UK's ambassador to Japan, Sir Stephen Gomersall, pointing out that investors might pull out of the UK if a pro-euro agenda was not pushed. Arch sceptics such as Lord Hanson leapt forward to claim these leaks sprang from pro-euro ministers attempting to get their spin on Invest UK figures in first. Senior government officials swiftly replied there was no evidence to back the Jeremiahs. But on Thursday Robin Cook waded in, stating that joining the euro was 'inevitable'. And on Friday European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg said in a newspaper interview that Britain was 'suffering greatly' from being outside the euro and that 'the United Kingdom satisfies all the conditions for entry, except that of the exchange rate.' All of which left a profound muddle for those not firmly in one camp or the other, still seeking answers to such questions as: does remaining outside the euro really concern all inward investors? Some of the companies mentioned in the Gomersall telegram - Nissan, Honda and bearing manufacturer NSK - are under the same exchange rate pressures as the UK manufacturers that have so publicly expressed pain in the past three years. Gomersall and Fraser also indicated that companies further up the 'value chain' were vulnerable, too. In sectors such as electronics, companies such as Matsushita, Sony and Aiwa are making investment decisions on where to make new generations of high-value products. Nurturing these companies and 'new economy' knowledge-based businesses is seen both by ministers and Invest UK officials as the future of inward investment policy. Invest UK states in its report that it 'has focused on attracting high quality knowledge-driven projects into the UK' and trumpets its success in attracting computer software, internet, telecoms and e-business investment to the UK. The Invest UK figures - which show that 48 per cent of investment comes from the US - were accompanied by a statement from Byers, who stressed once again the importance inward investors attached to the euro issue. The impression from all of this appears to be that although current investment levels are strong, decisions being taken now may cause downturns in future, and, like manufacturers in traditional sectors, investment by electronics and 'new economy' companies could be at risk from volatility. Is this the case? At one level manufacturers in higher technology sectors do have similar concerns to more traditional companies. Stephen Radley chief economist at the Engineering Employers Federation says: 'Some bigger electronics companies are looking to move production away from the UK into the euro zone or eastern Europe to avoid the currency issue.' EEF's Scottish head Peter Hughes says: 'IBM in Greenock is a good example. Our members are concerned that they are switching supply of components away from the UK to Eastern Europe, even India. Then they can lower costs and match them to revenues.' Alan Wood, chief executive of electronics manufacturer Siemens UK, with 16,000 employees, says that no major investment decisions have been reversed because of the euro, but admits that senior German figures are concerned about the UK's reluctance to join. The picture is more complicated than these examples suggest. Inward investment is not simply about building plants. Only 40 per cent of the total last year involved manufacturing - more went to the services, particularly the financial, sector, where there is less concern about currency swings. Also, much inward investment involves company takeovers, which may not add jobs, but may increase productivity. It is more difficult to assess the impact of the euro on these factors. So if Gomersall, Fraser and Byers are expressing concern about high-value, knowledge-based businesses, they are likely to be ones that make high value things such as electronics, mobile phones and software packages. Here, analysts point to three key factors in the euro argument. The first is the value of a company's products. The second is its geographical structure - are its costs and revenues in the same currency areas? And the third - how will currency swings affect productivity? Nick Matthews of the Warwick Manufacturing Group at Warwick University says: 'If you are exporting high volume goods and selling them on their competitive price, you are going to be affected by exchange rates. 'Higher value products -- electronics or aerospace - are not sold simply on price. Quality and design issues make companies more resilient.' In 1998 Siemens closed a £1.2bn chip plant in Tyneside with the loss of 1,000 jobs. There was concern that the sterling/euro exchange rate was pushing hi-tech inward investment away. Wood says a slump in world prices caused the closure. Although the jobs were skilled and the plant expensive (£1.2bn) the product - basic Dram memory chips - is a commodity exposed to vicious demand and price cycles, rather than a high value item. Some companies making the products highlighted in last week's report do not see the euro as significant at all. Telecoms manufacturer Motorola has been in the UK for 31 years and now employs 10,000 people in six major plants. Earlier this year it took over a semiconductor plant from Hyundai in Dunfermline. Instead of making Dram chips, it will produce hi-tech products for mobile phones and auto electronics, which are more specialised, valuable and capable of sustaining demand than those that Siemens made. Motorola's Mark Durrant says: 'We take a wide variety of factors into account. But the euro is not one of them.' The same is true of software companies. Software industry analyst Richard Holway says that investment decisions are entirely unaffected by currency. This leads on to the second point - the location and structure of companies and the type of investment in the UK. As officials are keen to point out, companies pay dearly for manufacturing in the relatively high cost 'sterling zone' and selling into the lower-revenue 'euro zone'. Some companies avoid this trap. Holway's example is Microsoft, which has invested heavily in software development in Cambridge. 'The software products designed here will be sold in Europe, but they will be manufactured and distributed in Microsoft plants in France, Germany and Italy, where costs and revenues can be matched.' This, he says, is what distinguishes UK investment from that in Ireland - where euro enthusiasts point to a burgeoning hi-tech sector, nurtured by protection from currency volatility - but where jobs tend to be 'lower value', such as call centre operatives. The third key factor is productivity. Car industry executives, for example, are concerned that productivity improvements of 7 per cent a year are swamped by 12 per cent currency fluctuations. But, as Radley points out, productivity improvements in newer, higher technology companies are far greater, and allow them to ride the currency swings to a greater degree. Official figures show that the electrical and electronics sectors saw productivity increase by 5.4 per cent in 1998 and 12.3 per cent in 1999. This compares with 0.9 per cent and 1.0 per cent for the economy as a whole, and -0.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent for manufacturing. 'We find that the euro is less of an issue for some of these companies. It is easier for them to make productivity gains, which help offset currency problems,' says Radley. None of these factors on its own may explain why higher technology investment has been pouring into the UK. It is clear that many manufacturers will watch the euro issue closely. But it is also likely that those 'new economy' companies lauded by ministers and Invest UK will have it at the back, not the front, of their minds. Some we won, some we lost Arrivals 1999 Component maker Toyota Gosei spends £32 million on a seals plant in Rotherham, creating 400 jobs. Canadian telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks creates 1,800 jobs, increasing capacity at sites in Paignton, Devon, and Monkstown in Northern Ireland. Grundig expands Llantrisant plant; creates 120 jobs making set-top boxes. 2000 US TV and internet shopping operator QVC doubles size of distribution centre on Merseyside, creating 1,000 jobs.

Thanks to the persistent drizzle, the weekend standoff in Portadown - billed, like a Hollywood blockbuster, as Drumcree Six - turned into something of a damp squib. Hundreds of the marchers sought refuge from the rain rather than face down the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who had come to stop them marching their traditional route down the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road. But if Sunday night was mercifully more peaceful than had been feared, Drumcree Six has not been a violence-free affair. On the contrary, the standoff has inspired trouble across Northern Ireland, from the petrol bombs and burning barricades in \"loyalist\" areas to Sunday's 300lb car bomb in Stewartstown - planted by the rejectionist Real IRA in a bid to ratchet up the Drumcree crisis. Still, the chief tension gripping the province is not so much between Catholics and Protestants as between Protestants and Protestants. For this is a civil war within unionism, even within the Orange Order itself, centred on a direct, rejectionist challenge to David Trimble and his strategy of compromise: witness the branding by the Drumcree marchers of Mr Trimble as a Judas who deserves to be drummed out of the order - if he is not lynched first. The Ulster Unionist leader has a strong case to throw back to his detractors. He can charge them on a multiple count of hypocrisy. First, they are guilty of what Progressive Unionist leader David Ervine calls \"à la carte United Kingdom-ism\" - meaning that these loyalists pick and choose what it is they are loyal to. They insist that the RUC must remain unchanged, even as they pelt it with stones and brand it \"the military wing of Sinn Fein\". They claim to be loyal to UK law, yet ignore the ruling of the parades commission, a fully lawful UK body. They say they hate the peace process because it puts former terrorists into government, yet their leaders refuse to condemn violence and they are cheered on by a convicted loyalist terrorist, Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair. Mr Trimble is on a collision course with the hardliners of Orangeism. He wants to reduce their influence within unionism. He is right. For what they have demonstrated this last week is that they are stuck in the bigotry of the past. And that is the force to be stood against at Drumcree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2000/jul/11/britishidentity.martinwainwright","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-11T01:17:47Z","webTitle":"Manchester's united","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/11/britishidentity.martinwainwright","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jul/11/britishidentity.martinwainwright","fields":{"headline":"Manchester's united","bodyText":"Manchester is the most successful city in the United Kingdom outside London, but during the past decade Mancunians have noticed something deadly about their path to prosperity. It hides a stealth attack by centralised, London-based, corporate business culture. The world's biggest Marks &amp; Spencer (a mile to circumnavigate) and the world's best Waterstones (at least until they sacked its inspirational manager Robert Topping last month) are among the many flags waved by Manchester in justified PR for its current success. But a recent meeting of city activists asked bluntly: so what? Aren't whopping Waterstones and Marks &amp; Sparks (and Starbucks, and Pr t à Manger and Café Uno) just as much the badges of Nottingham, Birmingham and Leeds? Becoming Anywhereville UK has been a seductive danger to the big cities before. In the 60s, large new developments engulfed so many of their centres. Coincidental was the demise of great provincial names which told you unquestionably where you were: Schofields store in Leeds, Binns in Newcastle - some survive as names, but only a handful have their budgets and strategies decided outside the City. That is the financial reality facing Manchester's city- centre independents, but they went ahead the other night to hammer out an agreement at The Cube, the cool local gallery. According to developer Nick Johnson, who owns the Atlas bar and brought back city centre living to Manchester in the 90s with Tom Bloxham of Urban Splash, \"Independents generate wealth that stays here. Our money doesn't go off to the City. It's spent in the local economy.\" This helps towards every regional city's dream of insulation from outside economic buffetings, especially that sense of powerlessness when accountants far away close down a plant, shop or bar for reasons which have nothing to do with the micro-economy. For that reason alone, Manchester city council is instinctively friendly towards the independents. The council's attitude has also been shaped by the benign effects of the McEnroe Club. This was founded in the mid-90s in spontaneous, you-cannot-be-serious, horror at a banal marketing slogan - \"Manchester's Up and Going\", which was speedily dropped, along with most of the executives at the Marketing Manchester quango. The club has always been more of an idea than a formal association, but has become a conduit between bright sparks in the commercial sector and city hall. It helped, crucially, to boost the pride Manchester wears like a distinctive badge on the physical fabric of its post-IRA bomb development. Tom Bloxham likes quoting the Athenian oath: \"We will leave this city greater, better and more beautiful than it was left to us.\" That is evident in the quality of new building. The centre has its first new street in 50 years. A new view of the cathedral has been opened up and Tudor houses and pubs boldly dismantled and repositioned. The glass wall of M&amp;S and the coming £60m Urbis art gallery and museum opposite the Printworks centre are world-class designs. \"There's been a shared understanding of each other's position, recognising the collective benefit of doing something that little bit better, that little bit different,\" says Nick Johnson. \"The city took on the challenge to raise the quality of the built environment partly because we independents wouldn't stop banging on about it. If we can do it for the built environment, we can do it for the people who occupy the spaces that are created by the built environment. That's what this is about.\" The banging-on illustrated another role unique to the independents. As pathfinders, they have taken risks - in the same way in which developer Peter Connolly has in Leeds. His daring in converting rotting mills - and a barge - triggered the regeneration of the Yorkshire city's disgusting riverfront in the early 90s. Similarly, the Atlas bar's £200,000 investment in Manchester's Castlefields was followed, when it was crystal clear that the venture was blue chip, by Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley spending £2m on their Quay Bar just down the road. The pattern is spreading, even to Manchester planners' supposed reservation for funky, one-off enterprises in the Northern Quarter. The warren of shoplets in Afflecks Palace, where Tom Bloxham started in business selling posters such as \"On the sixth day, God created Man. . . chester\", is having to get used to the idea of sharing the streets with £20m worth of mixed-use and private sector housing in Smithfield Buildings (mixed use which, crucially, developers AMEC have reserved in part for independent firms). On Canal Street, where Carol Ainscow got the village going with her independent bar a decade ago, Whitbread's now runs four gay pubs. The independents' movement is not gunning for the corporates, only against their dominance. Mr Johnson and fellow-organisers acknowledge that design triumphed in the 90s' cityscape \"not by belligerence but by clever negotiation\": outside investment is an essential part of civic success. Rebellion is limited to demanding balance in order to \"allow inde pendent operators to flourish and add a richness and dimension that we desperately need.\" Last week the north-west's (non-statutory) regional assembly held a talk-in in Manchester, drawing energising groups such as Aurora, a boosters' club run by such people as Ruth Turner, co-founder of the Big Issue in the North. She has left the magazine (another Northern Quarter inhabitant) to go into lobbying and regional politicking full-time. Ms Turner, Aurora and the others are devolutionists. They refer to the sense of distinct identity notable in Glasgow and Edinburgh, especially in the run-up to Scottish devolution. They reject the alternative, which would be to rename the north-west Anywhereville.

It was the month when the Argentinians surrendered the Falkland Islands, the Israelis invaded Lebanon and the late Princess Diana gave birth to Prince William. But Padoa-Schioppa, the then director of economic and financial affairs at the European commission, had other things on his mind. Expounding and expanding his views on the liberalisation of capital, he started by quoting article 67 of the Treaty of Rome; he ended by calling for a single currency. \"Fully fledged European monetary union is the high road to policy coordination and economic convergence,\" he said. \"It would be sufficient to realise one major achievement: monetary union.\" The speech was never going to make the headlines. Talks entitled Capital Mobility: Why is the Treaty not Implemented? rarely do. Moreover, 18 years ago, advocating a single currency was much like calling for the world to speak Esperanto - idealism masquerading as common sense. An intellectual house of cards which would collapse at the first whiff of reality. Now it is a reality, albeit a faltering and controversial one. And Padoa-Schioppa, who is now a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB), has been key to making it one. The Financial Times has described him as: \"One of a small group of people who can claim that they invented the single currency.\" Sir David Walker, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Europe, who worked alongside Padoa-Schioppa over several decades, goes further, describing him as: \"The central figure in the thinking that lead to a new Europe.\" At a time when the issue in Britain is wrapped up in evasions, distortions and semantic arguments, might a visit to the man who started it all cast a little light on a debate which often feels as though it is being held in semi-darkness? Perhaps this quintessential European, this Italian who lives in Germany, spent his childhood in France and thinks in English, can offer us a glimpse of the European ideal in its purest form? You will find him amid the alphabet soup of acronyms which make up the European lexicon, in between Pace (Programme of Advanced Continuing Education) and Palabre (a project con cerned with the integration of artificial intelligence). In Britain he is as little known as ever. But among the relatively small circles who follow the twist sand turns of EU development, he is the brains behind the project which has united much of Europe, is dividing the present UK government and brought down the last one. He was the secretary of the Delors committee whose report in 1989 returned the issue of monetary union to centre stage and provided a blueprint for the Maastricht Treaty. The man who drew up the initial draft of the Rome Extraordinary Summit of October 1990; one of the \"Gang of Four\" who prepared all the technical and diplomatic stages which led to the \"Rome conclusions\". These, in turn, declared January 1994 as the beginning of the second stage of a more intensive economic and monetary coordination before the creation of a central bank. He was there when the vital documents were passed from the civil servants to elected premiers to sign; he is there in Frankfurt supporting the euro on the world stage. But back in 1982, when he delivered his speech, such progress seemed a long way off. \"There is a difference between what you think is necessary and what you think is possible,\" he says. \"In the early 80s I was convinced that European monetary union was necessary. This was not a Damascene conversion but something that occurred to me over a period of time.\" His role in its construction was not upfront at the despatch boxes of individual European parliaments, where the political battles were being waged, but in the thinking, crafting and drafting behind the scenes. \"We all have a range of activities at our disposal which go from participating in intellectual debate into more concrete policy statements and positions,\" he says referring to his speech in 1982. \"I regarded this idea as a part of an intellectual debate.\" His versatility and discipline in this regard, says Walker, is awesome. \"He has an extraordinary capacity to see both the wood and the trees at the same time. He can see the big vision from the top down and the details from the bottom up. He sits with a blank piece of paper and maps out an entire strategy. He'll say 'There are 24 steps here', and then he'll go through them all systematically.\" This is also how he talks: in precise measured sentences often punctuated by numbers. There are \"three\" reasons why the euro has been a success; \"two\" conflicting problems with speaking a foreign language; and \"two\" strands to Britain's negotiating techniques. It is a degree of precision which does not just stop at his speech but which is clear from his clothes and general appearance. He keeps himself fit - he is a very young 59 - with a daily exercise regime which lasts exactly 11 minutes. His suit, like his hair, is a well-cut grey. A small man with a large brain rattling around in a huge office on the 34th of the European central bank. It is a vast plot in the middle of the Frankfurt skyline with space enough for a badminton court and a few table-tennis tables. The enormous windows offer an impressive view of a rather unimpressive, anodyne city. He is very much the product of both his age and his upbringing, brought up in the north-east of Italy by a father who worked in insurance and a mother who raised four children. \"Both my parents were intellectuals. My father had been a teacher. We were a cultivated family.\" Born in 1940, he is part of the generation of continental Europeans whose views on the future of Europe were shaped by the aftermath of the second world war. With despair just behind them, they were intoxicated with optimism that in an age of reason they could construct a better world than their parents. \"I first met my father when I was five when he came back from the war. It was a time not so much of poverty but real indigence. People of this generation grew up with a strong conviction that the unity of Europe was the only way out.\" He became a model European. He learned German at school and during a gap year in Bremen, English as a graduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and French during holidays in the Alps. He dreams in Italian and thinks in either Italian, French or English. \"I tend to think in the language in which I'm working at the time. But for most things I very much like to use English even though it is not my mother tongue because it is more concise, more precise, more concrete. It's like being an artisan. I have to weigh up how refined the tool is in my hands and how much I like to use it.\" Economics was not the obvious conduit for all these talents. As a young man he was far more taken with history and philosophy, but felt the need to apply those disciplines in the real world: \"I needed to do something closer to reality. \"Economics was the compromise, but in a way it was quite painful for me to be an economist.\" When his contemporaries were taking to the streets to bring down capitalism throughout the western world, Padoa-Schioppa was helping to shore it up with a job at the Italian Central Bank. After that came various high-level jobs related to banking, economics and finance, both in Italy and the European Commission. He was not the first person to have proposed a single currency. There are several people who could make that claim to fame, although the chief responsibility sits on the fragile shoulders of Pierre Werner, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, who is now 87 and recently suffered a stroke. In 1970 he put his name to the report which called for the establishment of EMU and a European Central Bank by 1980. But the economic slump of the 70s jettisoned Werner's plans and they were not to be fully considered again until the Delors committee got together in the late 80s. If anything, Padoa-Schioppa likes to play down his role. It was not until the late 80s that he started to think that a single currency had gone from a necessity to a possibility. \"There was no single moment when it went from a dream to a reality,\" he says. \"But there were several decisive moments. The Delors committee, the inter-governmental conference, the agreement of the heads of state were among them.\" And throughout there was always the possibility of failure. \"There were moments when the whole thing could have fallen apart. The positive additions were always partial developments; but any negative developments would have been total. The biggest risk came with the currency crisis of 1992 - most people at that stage thought the likelihood of us achieving EMU was very low.\" Even though he doesn't say it, chief among the headaches throughout this time were the recalcitrant British. He seems quite bemused and not a little impressed by Britain's negotiating strategy. \"They did it in a masterful way. First they influenced the substance of the project so that it would be more suitable to them if they did want to sign up to it. And then they carve out a special status for themselves which means they do not have to sign up to it.\" He is not worried by Britain's decision to stay out of the euro. In fact he thinks that unless Britain emerges with a pro-European consensus its inclusion could damage Britain and destabilise the entire project. \"In most European countries a shift in politics does not fundamentally change the country's European policy,\" he says. \"There is not much difference between Kohl and Schroeder or Juppe and Jospin when it comes to supporting the EU process. But there are some countries where this is not the case, such as the United Kingdom, where the fundamental attitude of the population is not united behind the European Union. So long as they are not members of Euroland this fragility of support does not worry me. I would be concerned if this fragility remained and they were part of Euroland.\" That said, from the outset Euroland has seemed to have done a pretty good job of exuding fragility all on its own. No sooner had the euro been released than the market took it by the scruff of the neck and threw it down so hard it sank below the dollar and has yet to surface. \"I did take it as a sign of a bad start but not as a crisis,\" Padoa-Schioppa says. \"To some extent in the financial world perceptions are a reality and even misperceptions can be a reality and so its decline was significant in that sense. But the day it actually fell below the dollar was not important to me. I remember what I was doing the day Kennedy was assassinated [studying English on a course in Britain] or when man first walked on the moon [on a trip to Maine from Boston]. But I don't remember the day the Euro fell below the pound. \"British people are worried by the strong pound and we were concerned about a weak Euro. The real sign of success, or lack of success, is that the euro is accepted as a reality . . . that it is here to stay in Euroland. Nobody, not the financial system, the market, the unions, business sectors, questions the fact that the euro is a fait accompli .\" Unless, that is, you happen to live in Britain, where almost everybody questions that very fact. Most people still do not want it, and a referendum (when and if it comes) is as likely to split families and friends as parties and governments. To some it represents a threat to our sovereignty; to others the most potent symbol of our xenophobic insularity. But to Padoa-Schioppa it is money that can be used from \"Lisbon to Leipzig\". Something that started as necessary, became possible and now, he believes, is unavoidable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/jul/12/firstchapters.extract2","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-12T14:06:13Z","webTitle":"Trilobite: part two","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/12/firstchapters.extract2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jul/12/firstchapters.extract2","fields":{"headline":"Trilobite: Eyewitness to Evolution by Richard Fortey","bodyText":"Chapter One: Discovery (cont/d) If you can have love at first sight, then I fell in love with trilobites at the age of fourteen. The peninsula of St Davids forms the south-western promontory of South Wales, extending westwards like a miniature version of the Cornish peninsula where Hardy, too, encountered love. Like Cornwall, it is a region of spectacular and ancient cliffs, while inland the scenery is flat and characterless. There are little coves here, too, with names like Solva and Abercastle, formerly wild and remote fishing villages, but now spruce with whitewash over the rough stone. But the cliffs are as wild as ever they were, and displaying rock folds as convoluted as anything in Cornwall. A walk along the coastal path parades one rock formation after another, delineated by contrasts in colour and texture: here massive yellow or purple sandstones plunge like naked ribs into the churning foam, there a group of contorted dark shales zig-zag up the cliffs like some sort of beserk concertina. In Caerfai Bay there are bright red shales, looking improbably pert in a world of dun geology. All of these rocks are still more ancient than their Cornish counterparts. They date from the Cambrian period, the oldest of the shales having been laid down as muds beneath the sea something like 545 million years before the present. This is getting back to the beginning of things, to a time before there were any plants on land, to a time before any kind of backboned animal existed. Yet there were already trilobites to witness this nascent world. These trilobites were 200 million years older than Thomas Hardy's invented fossil (or, I should say, its real equivalents) - a span a hundred times longer than Man's brief tenancy of this planet. This was the time I explored with a coal hammer at a period of my life when my voice had just turned unreliably falsetto and baritone by turns. While others discovered girls, I discovered trilobites. I had marked the presence of fossils on a local map. They were described as the oldest fossils in the British Isles. What could be more irresistible? There was something extraordinarily exciting about tapping into a vein of such prehistory. The top dressing of the landscape of human tenancy was stripped away to reveal some deeper reality, layer after layer of geological time unpeeled in my imagination. While my long-suffering mother knitted or read, I beat the rocks at Nine Wells and Porth-y-rhaw*. These were places where the rocks were accessible by foot and could be broken by sheer effort. I did not even have a proper geological hammer. The fever of discovery was upon me. I learned how to break the hard rock so that it split in the same direction as the former sea floor - this way I was more likely to retrieve something recognizable. It was clear that tectonic forces had tipped the strata vertically. I had to scrabble to dislodge reasonable-sized blocks for breakage. I ignored the sharp pieces of gorse that speared the backs of my hands. Time had made the rock both hard and brittle: it seemed to want to break anywhere but in the right direction. On the broken surfaces there were scraps and fragments of what might, or might not have been the remains of past life: black patches, a little shinier than the rest of the rock. Then, at last, I found a trilobite. The rock simply parted around the animal, like some sort of revelation. The truth is that the fossil itself had rendered the rock weaker: it was predisposed to reveal itself, almost as if it desired disclosure. I was left holding two pieces of rock: in my left hand the positive impression of the creature itself (known as the part); in my right hand the negative mould which had once comprised its other half (the counterpart); the two together snuggling up to survive the vicissitudes of millions of years of entombment. There was a brownish stain on the fossil, but to me it was no disfigurement - surely what I held was the textbook come alive. Drawings and photographs could not compare with the joy of actually touching a find which seemed, in the egotistical glow of boyhood, dedicated to yourself alone. This was my first discovery of the animals that would change my life. The long thin eyes of the trilobite regarded me and I returned the gaze. More compelling than any pair of blue eyes, there was a shiver of recognition across 500 million years. I would one day learn that the trilobite had a name, Paradoxides. When we first exchanged glances I knew nothing of classification or nomenclature, and it did not matter to me: there was plenty of time to learn more. What I held was a specimen that fitted comfortably into the palm of my hand. It was clearly divided along its length into three lobes - a convex central portion and to each side of it identical, but slightly flattened, areas. These were the lobes implied by the name - trilobite. The whole animal seemed to bulge towards one end. I knew, by some principle which I could not articulate, that the wider end was the head of the animal. And of course upon this head there were the eyes. Despite the unfamiliar conformation of the fossil, I knew that eyes must always belong on heads. So despite the exoticism of the fossil there was already a common bond between me and the trilobite - we both had our heads screwed on the right way. I could see that the body was subdivided into a number of little divisions - or segments, as I would learn to call them. Then there were cracks running across the body. These had nothing to do with the original structure of the animal, rather they were testimony to the long journey through geological time that the Cambrian creature had travelled before it fell apart under my hammer blow. They were joints in the fabric of the rock itself, the scars of an adventure that might have seen the trilobite eroded into oblivion or obliterated in the vice of a thousand tectonic accidents. This book grew out of that first encounter. I want to invest the trilobite with all the glamour of the dinosaur and twice its endurance. I want you to see the world through the eyes of trilobites, to help you to make a journey back through hundreds of millions of years. I will show that Hardy's description of the trilobite as 'but a low type of animal existence' was hardly just, but that his placing the animal at the centre of a drama of life and death might have been nearer the mark. This will be an unabashedly trilobito-centric view of the world. For trilobites have been witnesses to great events. Stephen Knight might have read from the trilobite's stony eyes that the predicament of a mere individual meant nothing. They have seen continents move, mountain chains elevated and eroded to their granite cores, they have survived ice ages and massive volcanic eruptions. No living thing can disengage itself from the biosphere, and trilobites followed the same pattern: their history was also shaped by the events they witnessed. When strangers express their surprise that it is possible to devote a lifetime to studying extinct 'bugs' I remind them of how much has happened in the last few thousand years and invite them to imagine what it is to be a historian of dozens of millions of years. We are doomed to know so little, like fishermen trying to understand an entire ocean by throwing in a few baited handlines. And if anyone wonders how it is possible to invest such devotion in a group of organisms which died out long ago as a result of who-knows-what inadequacies, there is an obvious answer. Trilobites survived for a total of three hundred million years, almost the whole duration of the Palaeozoic era: who are we johnny-come-latelies to label them as either 'primitive' or 'unsuccessful'? Men have so far survived half a per cent as long. There are accounts of scientific research that present the story of discovery as a series of glittering prizes that must be won by the most muscular intellect; this is science as a version of trial-by-combat. Or else scientific research is contained in a metaphor of a journey into uncharted territory, as expressed by Robert Louis Stevenson (in Pulvis et umbra): 'science carries us into realms of speculation, where there is no habitable city for the mind of man.' It is certainly true that there are races to be first in science and that a few massive minds venturing into 'realms of speculation' command the most attention - and they deserve it. Such models of scientific progress are typified by mathematicians and physicists, beautifully elaborated by Karl Popper in Conjectures and Refutations. Nonetheless, as a description of much of scientific endeavour, both the combative and the adventurous-speculative views are flawed. Many scientists - perhaps most of them - are a curious species for whom the pleasure of finding out is at least as important as the size of the goal. He or she is often a co-operative creature, comfortable with the happy exercise of innate ability, and if a momentous discovery comes it may arrive unexpectedly, like an unanticipated legacy. The unique property of the scientific endeavour is that so many of the regular footsoldiers contribute to the victory. Unlike a poetaster whose burblings are destined for true oblivion while the creations of a Keats survive, even a minor scientist might well make a permanent contribution to a famous campaign - an uncelebrated private who did not die in vain. Even the most singular fields of scientific inquiry relate in subtle or unexpected ways to larger questions. We shall see that an apparently self-contained and esoteric occupation like the study of trilobites has contributed to mighty debates about the origin of new species, or the nature of major features of evolution, or the distribution of the ancient continents. Those who started with a deep desire to know more about the details of life habits of vanished anamals - out of sheer curiosity - may suddenly realize that the detailed knowledge they have accrued relates to something different and more general: something as grand as the structure of an ancient ocean or the arrival of an asteroid on Earth. I believe that a more accurate image for the way much of science works might be a series of interconnecting paths. Each one has its own interests and delights; sometimes we know where a path leads, on others we are taken by surprise by twists and turns. And where there are intersections with other paths there can be unanticapated new directions which may lead to wholly unexpected views. Like Stephen and Elfride on the path above The Cliff with No Name there may be a crucial conjunction of circumstances which changes everything, and something as small and ancient as a trilobite may be the catalyst for the transformation. This book will follow a few of the paths that led me from that first schoolboy find. In pursuit of trilobites I shall visit remarkable places and spend time with remarkable people. Knowledge has been hard won, and there are heroes whose names are known only to me and a few of my friends, who deserve wider recognition. There are stories of personal tragedies which have influenced this tale of trilobites. Discovery isn't a simple matter of 'onwards and upwards'. It is imbued with all the tawdry and magnificent stuff of human lives. The story of that small part of science which is important to me will illustrate the way this defining human activity works better than some other accounts of greater endeavours: like relativity or the first few nanoseconds of the universe. Sometimes, a miniature gives a better likeness than a grandiose portrait. Come and see the world as it once was through the crystal eyes of the trilobite. We shall find out how trilobites tell us the pattern of evolution, and how it can be read from the rocks. We shall discover how faith in trilobites not merely moves mountains but shifts whole continents. We shall see how cast-off shells can be re-animated into living animals. We shall understand something of the origins of the richness of the animal kingdom. Through trilobites, we shall take possession of the geological past. * Both these sites are now legally protected from hammering, although they were not at the time of my schoolboy excursions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2000/jul/14/parliament.lordreform","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-14T01:07:03Z","webTitle":"House rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jul/14/parliament.lordreform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jul/14/parliament.lordreform","fields":{"headline":"House rules","bodyText":"When Tony Blair eventually moves out of Number 10, he will rightly be remembered as the United Kingdom\u0092s greatest constitutional reformer since the 19th century. He will have removed virtually all the hereditary peers from the Lords, granted devolution to Scotland and Wales and introduced proportional representation for elections to the European parliament. There will, however, be a strong objection to his standing as a reformer. He has barely introduced any changes to the operations or constitutional position of the Commons. Westminster still has the feel of a riverside club whose hours are more suited to gentlemen barristers than to modern professionals. Blairites insist the past three years have seen Westminster transformed. MPs are able to escape earlier on Thursdays. There are more opportunities for backbenchers since Westminster Hall was opened for morning debates. Select committees have an expanded role in pre-legislative scrutiny of bills. The government last week accepted a recommendation that sittings should end at 10pm, promoted by modernisers who have been campaigning for family-friendly hours. \u0093It\u0092s a breakthrough,\u0094 says Harriet Harman, the former social security secretary. But traditionalists were horrified, saying that the reform represented a dangerous tightening of the executive\u0092s grip over the legislature. Nicholas Winterton, the maverick Tory MP for Macclesfield, described the plans as \u0093monstrous\u0094 because they will cut the amount of time devoted to debating government bills, thereby reducing the powers of backbenchers. Under the proposals virtually all legislation will be timetabled - to ensure a 10pm close - which will end the ability of backbenchers to prolong debates with line-by-line scrutiny of bills. Margaret Beckett, leader of the house, forced through her proposals with the support of the Liberal Democrats, insisting they are fair-minded and do not undermine backbenchers. She pointed to the cross-party committee to be set up after the Queen\u0092s Speech every year to discuss the business of the coming session - an unprecedented novelty. However, Mrs Beckett\u0092s attempts to cast herself as a moderniser and a guardian of backbench rights have been undermined by her summary dismissal of the ground-breaking recommendations of the Commons\u0092 liaison committee. This is made up of the chairs of all the Commons\u0092 select committees. In March it confronted the executive and demanded party whips should be stripped of their role in appointing members of their committees, which gives the executive a tool for control. Its members, who gave their report the provocative title Shifting the Balance, vented their anger at Mrs Beckett on Monday when she finally appeared before them. Their frustrations were echoed in a pamphlet published this week by the Hansard Society*, which described Mrs Beckett's response as regrettable and lauded select committees as \u0093one of the few parliamentary success stories of recent times\u0094. The report\u0092s author had in mind the humiliation meted out by the foreign affairs committee to Sir John Kerr of the Foreign Office during the arms-to-Sierra Leone debate in 1998. Fresh ideas on Commons\u0092 reforms have been emanating from the opposition benches, as the Tories cast themselves in the unlikely role of modernisers. In a recent pamphlet Andrew Tyrie called for the prime minister to be called before a special committee once a month and for a parliamentary day to be devoted to committee work with no sitting of the house. To underline his claim that parliament is in a mess, Mr Tyrie highlighted the prime minister\u0092s voting record which is shown in the chart, comparing him with predecessors. He was somewhat undermined this week with the publication of figures showing Tory MPs have none too impressive a record in the lobbies. William Hague embraced reform this week with the publication of a report commissioned from the political science academic Lord Norton. It calls for a strengthening of the Commons in holding the government to account. Prime minister\u0092s questions should be restored to its twice weekly slot and committees beefed up to give them greater independence. Norton\u0092s 90 recommendations made a persuasive case for \u0093drawing the head of government more into parliament\u0094. But if Mr Hague became prime minister, would he really take up the mantle of reform? His support for Norton was reminiscent of Lord Hailsham\u0092s enthusiasm for strengthening MPs in his 1976 Dimbleby lecture. He complained that the commons had become an \u0093elective dictatorship\u0094 as it slavishly toed the government line. Within three years, he had been made lord chancellor by Margaret Thatcher and no more was heard of his charge. Unfettered prime ministerial control of the Commons is a prize Downing Street is unlikely to surrender, whoever is in power. How long this can be sustained in a rapidly changing world is open to question, a thought which prompted Mr Brazier to conclude his pamphlet by making the point about the relevance of our representatives: \u0093The lack of change in the Commons perhaps explains why it seems at odds with so much of a fast-moving society.\u0094 *Alex Brazier: Systematic Scrutiny, reforming the select committees, www.hansard-society.org.uk Nicholas Watt is the Guardian\u0092s political correspondent nicholas.watt@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jul/15/6","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-15T18:24:25Z","webTitle":"Somewhere for later","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jul/15/6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jul/15/6","fields":{"headline":"Somewhere for later","bodyText":"Europe The Lake District: Four-night easy-walking break staying near Grasmere from September 25.

Thanks to the prime minister's Frost programme promise we have long known that health spending will be rising by at least 5.6% a year from April next. Unless David Blunkett lost heavily - unlikely given the weekend briefings - education will be neck and neck. You do not need to be a senior wrangler to work out that leaves an average annual increase of nearly 4% in real terms for other Whitehall departments, assuming Mr Brown does nothing as dramatic as, say, reconnect social benefits to growth in earnings rather than prices. The chancellor's test this week, amid the hue and cry over \"presentation\", is presentation. That is to say, when he sets out his stall, his duty is to play the statesman. These are spending plans . If Tony Blair goes to the country in May next year, Mr Brown's largesse will have been visible for barely a month. He must not pretend the public are going to wake up on Wednesday in some new world of public affluence. Mr Brown's other task is to indicate just what this spending says about the Third Way or at least the limits of progressive government in a globalised era - and so about the identity of this Labour government. Last week research for the Smith Institute reminded us how class-bound the United Kingdom remains. Socio-economic circumstance, birth and upbringing, parents' job and income: these still determine life chances. New figures from the Department of Social Security showed how during Labour's first two years income inequality may, if anything, have risen - not surprising, given how little room for fiscal manoeuvre Labour had allowed itself, but dismaying none the less. So, how far will the comprehensive spending review set about making the UK a fairer place? Mr Brown's best answer is likely to be that large, sustained increases in spending on schools, together with nursery provision and the like will eventually make a difference to the skills, capacity and lives of the socially excluded. But that difference will be measurable only over years, generations even. Falsely precise promises and claims of \"turnaround\" will not wash. When the media clamour and the opposition speechify, modesty is not easy. The government has surely learned, however, that hyperbole has become its worst enemy. The country may be transfixed by large increases in health spending, but it will not be transformed; the National Health Service will not change much in the short run. This money will change none of the difficulties of control, quality, technology and access that are faced in varying degree by every health-care system, whatever its mixture of public, voluntary and private. On present reckoning, over the next five years Labour spending will stick pretty close to 40% of GDP. This is no magic ratio. It is entirely arbitrary and reflects nothing more than the government's assessment of what the public will wear by way of taxation. Available sums will buy health increases, but will not also purchase significant increases in welfare benefits - on a scale to attack official measures of inequality. To get both means spending a larger proportion of national income. But Mr Brown, like his Downing Street colleague, has a fatal tendency to play two ends against the middle, to attempt to be all things to all people. Tomorrow he has the nation's attention. It will be a golden opportunity to behave like a fiscal adult. He is no magician. Unless the public wills more resources he is, at best, a mere juggler of equally pressing claims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/jul/17/manifesto","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-17T16:25:44Z","webTitle":"The way forward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jul/17/manifesto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jul/17/manifesto","fields":{"headline":"The way forward","bodyText":"The manifesto should promise that the government carries through its achievements in devolution in Scotland and Wales and, circumstances permitting, in Northern Ireland. These were not intended to be overgrown local authorities. The Westminster parliament and Whitehall must take positive steps to withdraw, painful though it will be for them. Two steps are needed, as suggested in the manifesto. The posts of secretary of state for Scotland and Wales (and, it must be hoped when settled down properly, Northern Ireland) should go. The idea of a \"minister of the Isles\" should be pursued - there is an effective one of these already, in the home secretary, where the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and so on are concerned. This residual responsibility should concern overall budgeting matters and the various territories' interest in reserved national matters such as defence, many international concerns and other similar aspects necessary for the integrity of the United Kingdom. But in following through its logic the manifesto should promise that, subject to these reserved matters (which should be as minimal as possible), the territories should have more freedom than they have now. Abortion and broadcasting, certainly. But a government that believes in devolution should go further, even dramatically further, for instance by introducing more devolved tax regimes and regionally differentiated social security regimes and benefits. As the manifesto says, the corollary of this is that the \"West Midlothian\" question must be tackled head-on, with Scottish and Welsh members at Westminster prohibited from discussing or voting on purely English affairs. There might be room for a standing constitutional commission to oversee the relationships and any specific issues that come up across the divides. Such a commission might be the vehicle for re-examining the \"Barnett Formula\" that allocates Westminster money to the devolved areas.

(1) Westminster in 1999, when the tidal wave of \"bogus asylum seekers\" that would break across tabloid front pages was just a gentle swell on the horizon. A House of Commons standing committee is discussing the government's proposal to replace welfare benefits (of around £46 a week) with a system of food vouchers worth £35 a week. \"Many asylum seekers come from communities where wealth may be stored in jewellery,\" explains the Home Office minister Mike O'Brien, \"and it is right for us to take account of that wealth.\" \"Is the minister suggesting,\" asks Diane Abbott, MP, \"that asylum seekers should sell their jewellery, perhaps their wedding rings, as an alternative to the government meeting its moral and international responsibilities to provide a reasonable level of support?\" When O'Brien replies: \"I certainly am suggesting that,\" a Tory backbencher is heard to mutter: \"You'll be wanting the gold fillings out of their teeth next.\" (2) The David Irving libel trial in February. Reading from the transcript of an interview with Irving on Australian television, Richard Rampton, QC, barrister for the defence, asks why Irving had said that the idea of black men playing cricket for England made him feel \"queasy\". Irving: \"My reply to him on air was, what a pity it is that we have to have blacks on the team and that they are better than our whites.\" Rampton: \"Why is that a pity?\" Irving: \"It is a pity because I am English.\" Rampton: \"Are they not English too?\" Irving: \"Well, English or British, are you saying?\" Rampton: \"I am saying that they are English. Most of them are born here, just as all the Jews in England were born here, most of them.\" Irving: \"Are we talking about blacks or Jews now?\" Rampton: \"It does not matter. They are all English.\" (3) A traffic jam in North London. To pass the time, my daughter and I start to argue about whether having been born here makes her English. On her mother's side her grandparents were Greek refugees; on her father's side, American Jews, themselves the descendants of the \"economic migrants\" of the 19th century. My daughter agrees with Rampton, and, however much I argue to the contrary, remains convinced that she is, as she puts it, \"an Englander\". I am too fond of her to make use of the fact that she is, unknowingly, undercutting her case by using Yiddish. Besides, she is only four years old. When Diane Abbott asked whether asylum seekers should be forced to pawn their wedding rings, she may have thought her question was rhetorical - like Rampton's dismissal of the notion that being born here doesn't make you English. (Surely he knows that under Margaret Thatcher's 1981 Nationality Act, being born here doesn't even make you British.) But something besides wishful thinking links these episodes - a more disturbing set of associations thrown into high relief by another scene, in Dover last month, when customs officers opened the back of a lorry and found the bodies of 58 Chinese refugees piled against the back door. Press accounts said that the officers concerned would receive counselling and be allowed several days' leave. Pulling corpses off the back of a lorry is nasty work, even when the deaths are intentional. Between December 1941, and May 1942, the Nazis used three specially adapted lorries to kill 97,000 Jews near the village of Chelmno in Poland. These vehicles were prone to breakdowns, but, according to Christopher Browning, the author of The Path To Genocide and an expert witness at the Irving trial, the real problem was with the men. Browning cites a Nazi medical report describing the crews as suffering \"enormous emotional and health injuries\" and complaining of headaches after each unloading. Indeed, the desire to spare the Einsatzgruppen such stresses was one of the reasons behind Himmler's decision to shift to stationary, purpose-built gas chambers. For several months Britain has been in the midst of a Holocaust revival. From the daily coverage of the Irving trial, to David Edgar's dramatisation of Gitta Sereny\"s Albert Speer at the National Theatre, to the newly opened gallery at the Imperial War Museum, public awareness of the fate of European Jews is probably greater now than at any time in recent memory. The one place it hasn't penetrated is the current debate about Britain's treatment of refugees. If it had, those politicians who profess to be \"shocked and saddened\" at the death of 58 illegal immigrants might find the rest of us more sceptical when they suggest that the way to avoid such tragedies is to make it even harder for refugees to enter this country. As Louise London's recent book, Whitehall and the Jews 1933-48, reminds us, we have been down that road before. Assumptions about Britain's response to the Holocaust fall into two distinct, and diametrically opposed, schools. In 1945, Viscount Cranborne, parliamentary under secretary to the Foreign Office until 1938, and secretary for the dominions from 1943 to 1945, assured the House of Lords that Britain had done more than any other country to help the Jews. \"This comfortable view has proved remarkably durable,\" says London, \"and is still adduced to support claims that Britain has always admitted genuine refugees, and that the latest harsh measures against asylum seekers are merely designed to exclude bogus applicants.\" Nor is the left, always on the look-out for a stick with which to beat the government, immune to nostalgia for a supposedly more generous past. Cranborne's assertion came in response to Viscount Samuel, who had accused the government of condemning the Jews, \"not as Jews, but by means of immigration restrictions _ Out of that vast reservoir of misery and murder, only a trickle of escape was provided.\" Bernard Wasserstein examined this claim in some detail in Britain And The Jews Of Europe, 1939-45 (1979), as have numerous historians on both sides of the Atlantic since then. On the numbers alone, Britain's accusers appear to have the better case. Compare the 500,000-600,000 files on families and individuals seeking refuge in the archives of Britain's main Jewish organisations with the 80,000 refugees actually admitted. Clearly, this is not a question of a glass anywhere near half full. And as London points out, even the Kindertransports had their grim aspect. Of the 7,482 children given refuge here by the end of August 1939, London writes: \"Admission saved the children's lives. Exclusion sealed the fate of their parents.\" Last month's disclosure that MI6 knew about Nazi plans to \"liquidate\" 8,000 Roman Jews, yet did nothing to warn them, made headlines. And the evidence, from documents declassified in the US, that decoded radio intercepts dealing with the deportations were circulated to Winston Churchill may well force a revision of the widely held view that, unlike some of his ministers, Churchill did what he could to help the Jews. But there were already many instances in the documentary record when Whitehall's reluctance to admit refugees is expressed in language whose brutal frankness crosses over from callous indifference to outright anti-Semitism. In April 1943, for example, the cabinet committee on refugees, meeting on the eve of the Bermuda conference, felt compelled to point out that \"the Jewish element in the population of Poland was proportionally higher than was healthy\". At the time this observation was made, more than three-quarters of Poland's Jews had already been murdered. That December, RAM Hankey of the Foreign Office minuted his objection to an American request to allow funds to be sent to rescue 70,000 Romanian Jews: \"I suspect the real object of the scheme is financial - Jews in Europe getting out into dollars while there is yet time!\" In July 1944, when Jewish groups in Britain begged that something be done to save their brethren in Hungary - and when both they and the British government had every reason to know the fate of deported Jews - Herbert Morrison told the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, that it was \"essential that we should do nothing at all which involves the risk that the further reception of refugees here might be the ultimate outcome\". Louise London is the daughter of Jewish refugees, but her book is not a parochial indictment. As she points out, Britain's \"softly softly\" approach to Nazi anti-Semitism in the 1930s was supported by prominent British Jews, including Sir Herbert Samuel, who opposed a boycott on German goods. The fear that allowing too many Jews into Britain would trigger anti-Semitism here was shared by Whitehall mandarins and the Board of Deputies. After all, it was Chaim Weizmann, president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and later Israel's first president, who claimed that Jews \"have proved they are an insoluble element\" in European society. When, after the Anschluss, Britain reintroduced a visa requirement - forcing refugees to apply before entering Britain - the move was endorsed by Otto Schiff, on the grounds that \"Austrian Jews were largely of the shopkeeper and small trader class and would therefore prove much more difficult to emigrate than the average German who had come to the United Kingdom\". In the spring of 1933, Schiff and Neville Laski, KC, head of the board of deputies, sent the government a guarantee that no refugee would become a burden on public funds: \"All expense, whether temporary or permanent accommodation or maintenance, will be borne by the Jewish community without ultimate charge to the state.\" But when it came to Austrian Jews, the guarantee was made conditional. And when Czech Jews started fleeing in the wake of Munich, \"Jewish organisations in Britain refused to take responsibility for refugees from Czechoslovakia\". Schiff's Council for German Jewry \"resisted, to the last, all pressure to get directly involved in arranging the entry of Czech Jews. This made it certain that relatively few would obtain refuge in Britain.\" For the most part, London tells a story without heroes. She praises Eleanor Rathbone, the Christian MP whose parliamentary questions about government inaction made her the scourge of the Refugee Department, and puts in a good word for Sir Herbert Emerson, high commissioner for refugees, who emerges as an energetic and resourceful advocate of assistance. She also displays a great deal of sympathy for civil servants, often cast as Hitler's witting accomplices, especially in Zionist accounts. \"The strength of the belief of Home Office civil servants that ministers were wrong to insist that refugees should be required to leave after the end of the war is shown,\" she writes, \"by the effort they put into arguing the case that the only proper course was one of allowing the absorption of refugees who wished to remain.\" Even Neville Chamberlain gets credit for expanding asylum provision after Kristallnacht. The only conspicuous villain in her account is Herbert Morrison, whose determination to keep the Jews out of Britain didn't end with VE day. Despite civil service advice, Morrison \"clung to the view that at the end of the war the Home Office should require all refugees to depart, not even excepting those who had voluntarily served in the armed forces, and that those refugees who could not emigrate could be repatriated.\" London's main interest, however, is in policy, not personalities. And here what she has to say is a salutary corrective both to the view that Whitehall anti-Semitism was primarily to blame for Britain's failure to do more, and to those who feel that there has been a lamentable falling off in compas sion towards asylum seekers since the second world war. She makes it clear that \"by the 1930s the UK's tradition of granting asylum to refugees had been relegated to the background. Still the source of much national pride, the humanitarian tradition had little impact on practice and had been largely superseded. The inter-war system of immigration control contained no trace of any legal obligation to admit refugees.\" From the 1950 Aliens Act onwards, London argues, admission to Britain has depended on the government of the day's perception of British interest. During the Nazi period \"humanitarian aid to the Jews was assigned much lower priority than, for example, the maintenance of severe restrictions on alien immigration to the UK _ Thus, while the particulars of refugee policy varied according to the ever-changing circumstances of the Jews, its limits were defined by self-interest.\" In other words, there may have been times when, either because of public pressure or out of a need to keep the Americans (who had Jewish voters to worry about) onside, it was necessary to appear to act, but the limits on what might be done were never questioned, at least not within Whitehall. When Anthony Eden said, \"we should avoid any reproach that we are not doing all we can to rescue these unfortunate people,\" London explains that \"the object was not to rescue Jews, but to avoid the reproach that Britain was not doing all it could to rescue Jews. The priority, therefore, was to reduce public pressure for action and avoid criticism of inaction.\" Which is why the April 1943 Bermuda conference on refugees, a disaster from the point of view of the refugees and their advocates, \"was seen as a success for British policy. The conference decisions provided a rationale for refusing to act on demands for rescue. They also enabled the government to appear to be trying to ameliorate the position of refugees.\" It is impossible to read London's book without a mounting sense of déjà vu. Take out the word Jews and put in its place Romanies or Ethiopians or Kosovars or Bosnians and you have the essence of New Labour's asylum policy. The 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees is often seen as an act of reparation on the part of governments that spectacularly failed to save the Jews. But it is important to remember that it was also an artefact of the cold war, which brought its own countervailing pressure to bear on the national interest. That pressure is now gone, and Jack Straw is able to tell an EU conference that the convention should be changed so that asylum seekers are allowed to submit their claims before they enter Europe. If all the current protections are kept in place, this might be a welcome step. But it is more likely that the government means to screen asylum seekers in their place of origin, with the same hostile intent that forced Austrian and Czech Jews to apply for visas. Why else would the Tories - though they object to Straw's willingness to work through European institutions - be so supportive? That his own grandmother, a German Jewish refugee, might have been kept out by such a policy is no more of a restraining influence on the present Home Secretary than it would have been on his predecessor, himself the son of a Jewish refugee. • A version of this article first appeared in the London Review of Books.

Needless to say, the metaphyiscal nature of immortality means that the following costs are only approximate. Most mainstream religions recognise that life after death is always the most popular part of a belief system. Consequently it is, to an extent, a sellers' market. Christianity, for example, claims that whoever believes in the Son of God 'should not perish, but have everlasting life' (John 3:16). Great - except 'it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God' (Matthew 19:24). Eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, are a bit more flexible. The Tibetan Book of the Dead (£7.99) outlines the correct, if complicated, procedure for transcendence. If these religions run established stalls in the afterlife marketplace, then cults are the shadowy crack dealers. Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese cult that used sarin gas in Tokyo, promises ultimate happiness (but worldly possessions must be donated to the cult). The Raelian Movement believes that the cosmic being 'Elohim' will soon arrive by UFO. It is offering the first human cloning service (£137,000 per clone) and espouse free-love and 'sensual meditation'. Scientologists assert that we are all 'thetans', immortal spirits who have 'forgotten' we are immortal. Don't worry, Scientology can remind you. For a price! Annual membership is £205, but it costs much more to progress to each new level of awareness through 'auditing': you'll have to spend £685,000 to become a Gold Patron Meritorious. (Although it is only £6,850 to become a new Crusader.) Scientists, pragmatically, have kept faith with good old liquid nitrogen. Cryonics is the freezing of your corpse (or parts thereof) until technology exists that can revive you. Whole-body suspension and storage is just £92,500, while brain-only suspension is £10,250.

There are those who would instinctively believe the worst of the security services and, whatever the evidence, would remain invincibly confident that Mr Shayler had lifted a veil over an obscure and dark corner of public life. In their minds, at any rate, something of the smear would stick. No doubt, too, even false allegations of this kind can be used, and would continue to be used, to attack the security services, and to undermine public confidence in their activities. Nevertheless, in its own way, the refutation of this allegation is also a matter of public importance. The story of the Gadaffi bomb plot is either true or it is false, and unless there are compelling reasons of national security the public is entitled to know the facts, and as the eyes and ears of the public, journalists are entitled to investigate and report the facts, as I hope they would, dispassionately and fairly, without prejudgment or selectivity. Lord Justice Judge went on to explain that the basic liberties of the freedom against self-incrimination and the freedom of expression (Articles 6 and 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights) were 'bred in the bone' of English law. THE common law principle was expressed nearly 250 years ago in the famous case of Entick v Carrington [ 1765]. Entick was a clerk whose home in Stepney was broken into by Carrington and three other 'Messengers in Ordinary to the King'. Their defence was that they were acting under the authority of a warrant issued by the Earl of Halifax, a member of the Privy Council, and one of the principal Secretaries of State, which authorised and requested them 'to make strict and diligent search for the plaintiff' and to bring him with his 'books and papers in safe custody to be examined'. The issue was whether the Secretary of State had jurisdiction to seize the papers 'If this point should be determined in favour of the jurisdiction, the secret cabinets and bureaus of every subject in this kingdom will be thrown open to the search and inspection of a messenger, whenever the Secretary of State shall think fit to charge, or even to suspect, a person to be the author, printer, or publisher of a seditious libel this power is not supported by one single citation from any law book extant.' He went on to quote William Pitt, Earl of Chatham (1708-1778) 'THE poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail - its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may enter, the rain may enter - but the King of England cannot enter all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.' The measured language of the judge and the emotion of the orator are encapsulated in the simple phrase that 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. These principles were clearly understood in this country while an absolute monarch still reigned in France. If the Bourbon monarch, Louis XV, had heard of such language used by a prominent politician, and former First Minister, the speaker's best hope would have been for the king to have assumed that he was joking. But even that would not have prevented some fawning minion from dispatching a lettre de cachet to ensure that he was locked up, indefinitely, and without trial. It is hardly surprising therefore, that Voltaire, having twice been imprisoned in the Bastille, and eventually forced to live in exile, and notwithstanding what we can now appreciate were its great defects then, so greatly admired our constitution. These principles are interlinked.' In conclusion Lord Justice Judge launched an impassioned defence of the freedom of the press. Inconvenient or embarrassing revelations, whether for the security services, or for public authorities, should not be suppressed. Legal proceedings directed towards the seizure of the working papers of an individual journalist, or the premises of the newspaper or television programme publishing his or her reports, or the threat of such proceedings, tends to inhibit discussion. When a genuine investigation into possible corrupt or reprehensible activities by a public authority is being investigated by the media, compelling evidence would normally be needed to demonstrate that the public interest would be served by such proceedings. Otherwise, to the public disadvantage, legitimate enquiry and discussion, and 'the safety valve of effective investigative journalism', the phrase used in a different context by Lord Steyn in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Simms [1999], would be discouraged, perhaps stifled. In the wide terms sought in the original application, I believe that an order would have had a devastating and stifling effect on the proper investigation of the Shayler story. Virtually any journalist who made contact with him, and any newspaper publishing an article based on discussions with Shayler , would be at risk of a similar application to the present. To my mind that would be an unhealthy development, quite disproportionate to any practical advantages to the prosecution process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/jul/23/observerescapesection3","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-23T17:54:01Z","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/jul/23/observerescapesection3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/jul/23/observerescapesection3","fields":{"headline":"News","bodyText":"Legends lurk in the Lakes Something is stirring in the Lake District this summer.

There's a surprise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/26/euro.eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/26/euro.eu","fields":{"headline":"So few Britons are keen on Europe. There's a surprise","bodyText":"The least surprising news of the year was formally announced from Brussels yesterday. Support within the United Kingdom for our membership of the European Union is now at the lowest level ever recorded. It is apparently the worst batch of figures that the pollsters have produced since we joined. We don't like Europe. We think, like Nancy Mitford's Uncle Matt, that \"abroad\" is unutterably bloody and peopled by fiends and our experience of membership has done nothing to convince us otherwise. We are far and away the least enthusiastic member state according to any statistic that you care to measure. Well, surprise, surprise. The poor unfortunate put forward by the commission in Brussels to comment upon these results did himself few favours, however, when he suggested that it would need \"a long time\" to explain why this should be the case. We expect people in Brussels to make mistakes, but he could not have been more wrong. The reason for these figures can be given very simply and in next to no time: the EU and all its works is unpopular in the United Kingdom because British politicians have used the issue remorselessly throughout the past 30 years as a political football, playing alternatively to the narrow nationalism of the right or the socialist idealism of the left. Thus in the 70s the Labour left portrayed British membership of Europe as a force designed to prevent the pursuit and introduction of radical socialist policies, while throughout the 80s Margaret Thatcher deployed it as an inhibiting factor on her pursuit of unrestricted laissez-faire capitalism. Through much of the 90s, partly as a result of the well-meaning but profoundly weak premiership of John Major, it was allowed to develop into a touchstone issue which divided the Conservative party and rendered it politically incredible. That prepared a path for William Hague who has since pursued an approach apparently based on the belief that political - or, at least, electoral - salvation lies in a direct appeal to the basest amoral instincts of a nationalistic island race and hang the consequences. One person who understands this is Geoffrey Martin, the head of the European Commission office in the UK, who long ago recognised the pointlessness of attempting to do anything to try to improve the image of Europe in this country, and who was telling anyone who asked him yesterday that the situation was deteriorating and was likely to get worse. And was he surprised by this fact or these figures? He was not. No one could be surprised when the serious players did not want to discuss the matters involved seriously, and it was perfectly evident that in the forthcoming general election, the European issue would figure as it has so often before as a divisive factor within and between our political parties. They are still puzzled in continental Europe, in the rest of the union where all the statistics in the other 14 member states indicate a cheerful degree of acceptance and the acceptability of membership. The trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, was in the UK on a fact-finding mission earlier this month, talking to business leaders through the Confederation of British Industry, opinion-forming politicians, journalists and assorted policy wonks, in a committed attempt to try to understand what is going on and why we make our international political relationships so difficult for ourselves. He could have saved himself the journey because the answer is that actually we don't - it is not we, innocent members of the electorate, worrying about the weather or the children or the mortgage, who are to blame. It is rather, as usual, the politicians. So the next question is: what happens now? Is withdrawal from membership of Europe a possibility? Is it an option? Does anyone, even Mr Hague, happily reconciled as he seems to be with consigning much of his party's history and political philosophy to the memory hole, really believe that this is so? It seems improbable. The next developments will all be political and should be interpreted entirely within the context of the run-up to the next election. They will be concerned almost exclusively with the tiresome business of the single currency but, controversial though this currently may be, there is a view around, at home and abroad, that the outcome of this debate might eventually resolve the future of Britain's role in Europe. That depends, however, on how the government decides to play it. There are probably few members of the government who still have a subscription to Tribune, but it might repay someone with an interest in how to win the next election (given the acknowledged brand recognition problem) to nip out and get hold of the current issue. There they will find some tips on how to stay on in government offered in a dispassionate fashion by Bob Worcester, the opinion poll sage who runs Mori. It is a foolish politician who does not pay attention when Bob Worcester has something significant to say. He is a wise old cassowary and he knows what he is talking about. His theory goes like this: the Conservative party is perceived to be divided on the issue of Europe and therefore what the Labour party most needs to do is to ensure that its leading members do not attempt to steal the headlines by displaying their own differences. Gordon Brown, in Worcester's view, has got this absolutely right. Meanwhile Tony Blair should muzzle Peter Mandelson, shut up Stephen Byers - \"That would not be difficult,\" he observes, somewhat acidly - and tell Robin Cook his job is on the line. The people who are going to decide the next election are the people who are least likely to be paying close attention to the debate that is taking place on the question of a single currency, nor will they pay attention until the run-up to the referendum on a single currency. After Labour has won the election, the prime minister should promptly announce the date of the referendum. And the opinion polls? In 1975 before the referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the then EEC, the opinion polls showed that 55% of the electorate would vote to leave, as opposed to 45% who wanted to remain. The result, five months later in June, was 67% in favour of Britain remaining as a member and 33% against. In five months a coalition of the government backed by much of the political establishment - and, of course, the Conservative opposition - had secured a 22% swing. It was a remarkable achievement and Bob Worcester believes it can be pulled off again. Indeed he has written as much in a pamphlet for the Foreign Policy Centre, How the Euro Referendum Will be Won: Lessons from the 1975 Referendum. And he is rather hurt that he has been branded a cynic. He is quite right to be offended. He is more politically realistic than almost anyone else who has so far joined in this debate.

Can anyone explain this phenomenon? * I have seen this done. The geyser pool is at the top of a hole in the ground, perhaps 50m or more deep, full of water, which is continuously heated from the bottom by the adjacent mass of hot rock. Just before a natural \"blow\" the water towards the bottom will have reached a temperature well above normal boiling point, but it is prevented from boiling by pressure from the column above. Left to itself, the water will eventually become too hot for this unstable situation to persist; steam bubbles will form, and the geyser spontaneously \"blows\". To please an impatient audience, a travel guide can induce premature discharge by dropping soap into the pool. Arriving near the bottom, the soap starts to dissolve; as with any other solute, its presence depresses the boiling point of water, and steam-bubbles start to form and rise. Their arrival at the top usually causes a violent spillage of some water out of the pool. This reduces the weight of the column and its pressure, causing boiling of the whole column, as in a natural eruption. Tom Hering, Kegworth, Derby. Just outside London's Liverpool Street station, between the tracks and the arches, there are a number of small \"memorial-type\" statues. What are they? * The statues are some of the surviving decorative pieces of stone and brickwork from the old Liverpool Street station buildings that were demolished in the 1980s as part of the station redevelopment. Some of the carved stonework came from the old Hamilton House railway offices fronting Bishopsgate. Some of these show the initials GER (Great Eastern Railway), which built Liverpool Street station. There are also some examples of carved brickwork, shaped in the form of a half circle. There were originally six of these high on the wall of the building that was behind the concourse of platforms 11-18 of the old station. They depicted railway activities (signalman, porter, fireman, etc.) being undertaken by cherub-like beings. One of these has been incorporated into the new station, and at least one is in the site mentioned. The others seem to have been destroyed. The new station incorporates the carving mentioned as well as two others from the old station, one depicting a train and the other a ship. The war memorial and other memorial tablets from the old station have also survived and are on prominent display. Nigel Bowdidge, Brentwood, Essex. Does the human race have a future longer than its past? * Not according to the ancient Mayan people of South America. They claim that every cycle of life has five \"suns\", or ages, each of which is ended by a natural disaster, be it global freezing, a great meteor or a great flood. Their highly detailed calendar, which has predicted other events (such as the first world war) with great accuracy, shows us to be now living in the fifth, and last, sun of our life on earth. Furthermore, they have predicted that the present age will come to an end on December 23, 2012, in such a way that no human life will survive it. Hannah Rawlinson, Accra, Ghana. * Professor Joss Hawthorne is barking up the wrong science if he seeks support for an infinite human future from Frank Tipler (Notes &amp; Queries, July 13). Tipler envisages a finality to human evolution which negates the idea of an infinite future. Tipler's thesis is that there will come a specific point in time in the remote but finite future at which the human project will be complete. In his book, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, Tipler and John D Barrow state that there is a logical conclusion or end-state to human progress. They state that humanity is destined to expand into the universe and gather all knowledge. When all the knowledge that it is logically possible to acquire has been gathered, the Omega Point will have been reached. This will be an omnipotent entity which will reverse time and raise the dead. The final sentence in Tipler and Barrow's book is: \"And this is the end.\" Peter Stockill, Berwick Hills, Middlesbrough. Why are some countries, such as the Gambia, prefixed with \"the\", even when they are not plural (like the Netherlands)? * There appear to be three rules: where countries are named after rivers or mountain ranges, for example, the Gambia, the Lebanon; where the final noun in the name is preceded by an adjective and/or \"of\", for example, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech Republic; and for the plural names of island groups, for example, the Philippines, the Grenadines (islands or archipelagos ending in -a or -ia never take \"the\"). Of course, the rules in other European languages are completely different - for example, la France and die Schweiz . Alaisdair Raynham, Singapore. * There is a perfectly logical explanation as to why the country called Ukraine used to take a definite article. Under the Russian Empire, the part of Eastern Europe that is currently Ukraine and part of eastern Poland constituted the borderlands of the Empire - in Russian \"krai\" (\"edge\"). The Russian preposition \"u\", which is attached to the word \"krai\" as a prefix, means \"at\". This gives us the name \"Ukraina\", or \"The Edge of the Empire/Borderland\". The former use of the definite article in English (which does not exist in Russian) represented linguistic recognition of the political reality that what was then \"The Ukraine\" constituted the western limits of the Russian, and later the Soviet, empire. Since Ukraine became an independent country it has become a requirement in politically correct English to drop the article in deference to the fact that Ukraine, as an independent state, can no longer be considered a borderland territory of Russia. Brian Keegan, Paris. * To question Jim Burfield's assertion (Notes &amp; Queries, July 6) that The Hague is the only town on earth whose English name takes \"The\", a quick look in my atlas gives The Bight in the Bahamas, The Dalles in the USA, The Pas in Canada and The Rock and The Twins in Australia. Mike Rayner, Pity Me, Durham. * In Welsh we have Y Wyddfa for The Snowdon and Yr Albion for The Scotland among others. Bryn Gwyndaf Jones, Welwyn Garden City, Herts. When a football match is televised, why is the camera always on only one side of the pitch? * In film and television production a principle exists called the 180 degree rule: that two cameras should not face each other when filming the same subject. The reason for this is to stop the audience from becoming confused and disorientated. When you are watching from the stadium, you will sit on one side of the pitch, looking from one direction. When you watch the match on TV, you will watch the game from several angles thanks to the multi-camera set up. If the director was following a player with a camera on, say, the north side of the stadium then cut to another camera on the south side, the player on the screen will suddenly have appeared to change direction. If the second camera is on the same side of the pitch the player will continue in the same direction on the screen - this is called a \"match on action\". The same principle is used in most sports. Mike Harris, Colerne, Wilts. Why do cigarette packets in vending machines have only 16 fags in them? * For many years I worked in an American restaurant in London which had a machine dispensing packets containing 16 cigarettes. It was not possible to add the cost of the cigarettes to the restaurant bill, but as a courtesy the waiters would take the customers' change, get the cigarettes and return them to the table. On one occasion, an elderly American couple called me over to the table. \"I'm sorry to have to report this\", the husband said, \"but your waiter has stolen four of my cigarettes!\" No amount of explanation seemed to convince him otherwise. Needless to say, US cigarette vending machines dispense packs of 20. Russell Norman, London NW6. Any answers? I was brought up to believe that British subjects had certain freedoms - freedom of movement, assembly, speech etc, trial by jury, presumption of innocence, habeas corpus and so on. Do these rights still exist in full, or have they been curtailed by legislation? Matthew Lagden, London N16. A man was recently arrested for singing whilst riding a bike through the City of London at night. The arrest was apparently because an unrepealed 17th-century law exists forbidding song in the square mile at night. Why was such a law ever made? Liz Finney, London W4. As the 20th century apparently only lasted 99 years, is the Queen Mother really 101? Steve Parish, Warrington. My student son lives on beans, wholemeal toast and oranges in term time. He claims this gives him all the nutrients he requires. Is he right?

The stars of the show were men like Torrens Knight, the loyalist gunmen who walked into the Rising Sun bar in 1993 shouting \"trick or treat\" before firing randomly, killing eight people. Or James McArdle, the Canary Wharf bomber whose handiwork killed two men in February 1996. The sight of these people walking to freedom yesterday after serving such brief punishments - less than four years for double murder in McArdle's case - is enough to make the blood run cold. The disgust at these early releases has been compounded this week by an intense debate about crimes so heinous, it is said that their punishment should never end. The murder of Sarah Payne has prompted the demand for some killers to serve life with no prospect of release: yet here outside the Maze are hardened multiple murderers walking free. It is hard not to agree with Ishan Bashir, whose brother Inam was killed by that Docklands bomb: \"Terrorism has triumphed today,\" he said, \"and made a mockery of our rule of law.\" We can empathise with Mr Bashir and share the revulsion so many feel at this trampling on normal standards of justice. We can feel all that - and still defend the prisoner releases which all but wound up yesterday. We can do that by admitting a painful truth: that the tragedy of Northern Ireland is that it has not been a \"normal\" society and that the normal rules have not applied. The argument against the early release scheme - in our view, a much more agonising aspect of the Good Friday agreement than the more publicly vexed issue of decommissioning - is that it is at odds with the normal rule of law in a democratic society. As Michael Gove, the Times columnist and author of a new pamphlet on the peace process, argued this week, we would not let Sarah Payne's killer walk free after four years, so why James McArdle? His error is to pretend that Northern Ireland is West Sussex: it is not. Whether it was the shoot-to-kill policy of the 1980s, Diplock courts or internment, Northern Ireland has not enjoyed the same rule of law as the rest of the United Kingdom. That is because a war has been fought there. The Daily Telegraph may like to pretend there was no such conflict - hence its policy of putting \"peace process\" in quotation marks - and that the province just had an unusually high crime rate, but the rest of us know that Northern Ireland's tragedy was to be a 30-year-long exception to the rule of law. The consequence of that fact is that when it comes to making peace, the normal rules cannot always apply either. We know that from South Africa, where amnesty had to be extended to confessed killers, and from the Middle East where Israel has had to release thousands of convicted murderers for the sake of a series of peace accords. The painful fact is that when wars are ending, justice sometimes has to take second place to ensuring peace. British rightwingers know this argument well: after all, they made it themselves in the case of Augusto Pinochet. Even if the Chilean former dictator is guilty, they said, he should not be tried if that would upset the delicate settlement Chile has reached for itself. At least with Northern Ireland, in contrast with Chile, these killers have been called to account for their crimes. That they enjoy freedom too early is a function of Northern Ireland's past as an abnormal society - and we hope a step on the way to its future as a normal one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2000/jul/29/immigration.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-29T00:11:02Z","webTitle":"Immigration bond scheme dropped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jul/29/immigration.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jul/29/immigration.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Immigration bond scheme dropped","bodyText":"The government's controversial immigration bond scheme is being dropped, the Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz announced last night. Jack Straw had been planning to impose immigration \"bonds\" on visa applicants who want to visit relatives in Britain, but Mr Vaz said the proposal would not now go ahead for technical reasons. The proposal had provoked a storm of criticism that it was racist from immigration groups and campaigners on behalf of the ethnic minorities. Following the criticism Mr Straw said he would press ahead with an initial trial scheme for visitors from the Philippines and Morocco only. In a humiliating retreat, Mr Vaz said last night that \"the developmental work on the pilot study has identified a number of practical issues. Moves towards a more flexible approach to the operation of immigration control - including the introduction of new IT systems for issuing visas at posts overseas - have frustrated attempts to design a simple and effective scheme for providing a bond facility for visitors\". The decision was smuggled out on the final day of the parliament in a written answer. The bonds were to have been introduced for the hundreds of thousands of people from the Indian sub-continent who visit Britain each year for weddings, funerals and other events on family visit visas. The idea was put forward by Indian organisations as an alternative for those refused visas because entry clearance officers suspected they would not leave Britain at the end of their family visit. It was proposed that the family members in Britain would put up a cash payment in advance of the visit, which would be returned when the visitor left the country. Initial reports that the bond was to be fixed at £10,000 stirred fierce opposition to the scheme. Ministers later proposed the bond would be set at £3,000. The pilot study on financial bonds had been due to begin in October at two posts overseas, Manila and Casablanca. It was due to run for six months, followed by a further six months to monitor departure from the United Kingdom, and a further, brief period for analysis of the results. It was to be used in borderline cases; as an alternative to refusing a family visit visa if the applicant's intention to leave the UK was in doubt. The latest figures show that in 1998 1,500 people were refused a family visit visa at the embassy in Manila and 350 in Casablanca."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2000/jul/29/peterkingston","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-29T00:14:40Z","webTitle":"Audio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/29/peterkingston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jul/29/peterkingston","fields":{"headline":"Audio","bodyText":"The Periodic Kingdom Peter Atkins (Orion, £9.99, 180mn) Hear an extract If you were bored/ baffled as a kid by that elemental Scrabble board on the chem lab wall called the periodic table, plug this in and risk rekindling your adult interest in nature's 105 building blocks. Oxford's Professor of Chemistry presents the chart poetically, not just as a range of mysterious atomic numbers, but as a series of landscapes, whose topographies vary according to the mass, size, density and behaviour of the elements. It's a meaty listen for the scientifically inert, and a copy of the periodic table on the sleeve would have been a great help.
