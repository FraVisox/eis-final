The grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) asked Uniper, the owner of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, to start producing power from the coal-fired plant, prompting criticism from green campaigners. Temperatures broke 30C for the first time this year over the weekend and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer was 45% – 2.3 times the typical figure. The hot weather is expected to push up demand for power, as households and businesses switch on air conditioning units. Air conditioning accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity used in buildings around the world. One unit at the Ratcliffe plant was brought into action on Monday morning, with a second unit warmed up to cover the evening peak in power demand. The consultancy LCP Delta said wind generation was low on Monday and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which began on Sunday night, had reduced available generation by a further 1.3 gigawatts. Last week, a fault was found on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector that carries power between Norway and the UK, cutting electricity supplies. The power flowing through the 450-mile subsea cable has been reduced by half while the fault, discovered at an onshore facility in Norway, is repaired. The decision to turn to the fossil fuel angered green campaigners. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “It is a sign of failure that the National Grid is turning to one of the most polluting forms of power generation to deal with a summer heatwave that we know has been made worse because of climate change.” She added: “The government must get to work and upgrade our energy grid. In summer, we should be turning to solar power, yet we currently have renewable energy going to waste because our grid cannot transmit the power, and hundreds of renewables projects which are on hold because they can’t get connected.” National Grid has previously advised consumers to improve the energy efficiency of air conditioning by changing or cleaning the machine’s reusable filter, closing windows and doors and by shutting curtains to block the sun’s light and heat coming into the home. Ratcliffe-on-Soar was among the coal-fired power stations put on standby to provide extra power by the ESO over the winter amid concerns that a cold snap and a reduction in gas from Russia to Europe could lead to rolling blackouts. In the event, the plants were frequently warmed but only called into action in March, when EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power before the coldest night of the year. Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Coal is playing a bit-part role in the electricity grid, and both here and in Europe its use is plummeting, partly because of its high emissions. “With more offshore wind, and solar particularly in the summertime, coal’s back-up role will become redundant with smarter markets combined with batteries and other storage technologies.” The life of Ratcliffe’s fourth unit was extended for two years beyond its planned closure date last year, with all units now due to shut by September 2024 as Britain phases out burning coal for power generation. The ESO also called on households to save power by shifting their usage away from peak hours through its demand flexibility service. The network operator said last month that households and businesses saved enough power over the winter to power 10m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-470-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:44:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 470 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-470-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-470-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 470 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas.” In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there is a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital, saying that the city’s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. US president Joe Biden is to welcome British prime minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind”. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 299 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 299 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the runup to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier on Monday ahead of Putin’s visit. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’ foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’ defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Kyiv was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency has accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after midnight on Sunday. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes later. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency has reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/23/cold-war-britain-china-globalised-chinese-agent-christine-lee","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-23T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"A new cold war?

Britain’s relationship with China is much more complex than that ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week the British political establishment was shaken by a rare MI5 alert warning of a Chinese party-state agent operating in parliament. Christine Lee, who, according to MI5, has engaged in both overt and covert activity in support of the Chinese Communist party, cultivated links to British politicians for more than a decade (the Chinese embassy in London has denied these claims). It’s tempting to consider this revelation as yet another sign that we are entering a new cold war. In fact, the international landscape differs radically from the power struggle that defined the period after the second world war. To be sure, the world of spying and espionage still exists, but the current relationship between liberal democracies and authoritarian states is more like a phoney peace. Globalisation has entangled these opposing political regimes in complex and, at times, contradictory ways. The political culture built around the ruling party in China centralises power in a way that would be inconceivable in the UK. The CCP boasts an astonishing reach into myriad aspects of society as well as retaining an armed wing in the form of the People’s Liberation Army. At the same time, some British and international businesses now depend on access to Chinese markets, and appear willing to do whatever Beijing demands in order to sustain their presence in China. The global economy is not easily understood through the lens of the cold war, when these international links were present but far less developed. Today, supply chains and financial markets ensure nations are far more interdependent. If the cold war was defined by hostility short of direct military conflict, the phoney peace is an era in which interconnected nations are embroiled in growing hostility. These new conditions produce new challenges. First and foremost, liberal democracies must address an increasing risk to Asian communities. As last week’s case in parliament demonstrates, scrutiny of Chinese party-state activity is necessary. But there is always a danger that legitimate concern could spill over into irrational suspicion. Australia is a case in point: the country has experienced a rise in anti-Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment in the wake of party-state-linked scandals such as that of political donor Huang Xiangmo. Any attempts to shore up resilience to authoritarian interference must begin by considering overseas Chinese communities, acknowledging that they are frequently targeted by the Chinese party-state. One of the most prominent geopolitical hazards that liberal democracies now face is increasing dependence on authoritarian states. Britain’s decision to allow Chinese party-state involvement in the country’s civil nuclear energy sector is a useful microcosm of this wider situation, and it brings us back to Lee. While the decision to involve the Chinese party-state in Hinkley nuclear power station through a partnership with EDF was primarily financial, it was the first step to a Chinese-operated reactor on UK soil. In my own PhD research, I found documents showing that at a UK-China energy summit held in 2014, the British government acknowledged to Chinese officials that Hinkley was a pathway to a “majority led Chinese new build project including the use of Chinese reactor technology”. This was set to be the Bradwell site, led by China General Nuclear Power Group, using the Hualong One reactor. How does Lee fit into this picture? She has donated significant sums to Labour MP Barry Gardiner since the mid-2010s and has donated to his constituency office since 2009. Gardiner would play an important role in shaping the Labour party’s response to Hinkley as the official opposition. The Times reported that Gardiner “strongly opposed internal party criticism of Chinese involvement in the Hinkley Point project”, although Gardiner has said Lee gained no political advantage from him. In February 2013, Lee made a single donation to the Liberal Democrats’ Kingston borough office, the constituency of Ed Davey MP, who, at the time of the donation, was the secretary of state for energy and climate change. Davey would play a vital role in securing the future of Hinkley, not least by almost singlehandedly convincing the Liberal Democrats to back nuclear energy. Davey says he does not remember Lee. Yet Chinese party-state involvement in UK civil nuclear energy wouldn’t have been an option without support from the Conservative leadership, most enthusiastically from George Osborne. A year after the 2014 discussions, Osborne publicly asserted that Hinkley “opens the door for majority Chinese ownership of a subsequently nuclear project in Bradwell”. Multinational and transnational corporations play a significant role in this new landscape. Their reliance on markets and manufacturing sites in authoritarian states makes them potential channels of authoritarian influence in liberal democracies. Additionally, the channels such groups have forged can be employed by authoritarian states. This was what happened in the Hinkley case. The all-party parliamentary groups in Westminster represent one of these channels through which companies pay into the British political system. The China APPG, the Nuclear Energy APPG, and the Energy Studies APPG have all received sponsorship from French energy giant EDF – CGN’s partner in the Hinkley project. In addition, members of the Energy Studies APPG were taken to China by CGN to visit their Taishan nuclear power station at a cost of more than £52,500 to the Chinese party-state energy group. After the trip, the APPG’s chair, Ian Liddell-Grainger MP, reported back to parliament that CGN was working “hand in hand with EDF to develop as a major nuclear player, as well as develop its own reactors”. He said the Taishan power station was “very good” and “does the job”. As well as providing CGN feedback, Liddell-Grainger also intervened when ZTE, effectively a Chinese state-owned technology group, was labelled a national security risk in official UK intelligence advice. The MP supported ZTE’s “Whitehall lobbying campaign”, backed by consultants from the PR firm Sovereign Strategy, according to reports at the time. Such links are not uncommon in British politics. Since we tolerate channels through which commercial interests can influence political actors, we shouldn’t be surprised to hear allegations that adversarial states such as China employ the same means. The UK is not an outlier in this regard. Germany also risks greater dependence on an authoritarian state in the form of the controversial Nord Stream 2 project and the Russian gas it will supply. Predictably, here too we see some of the same patterns, most notably in the form of ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s position as chairman of the Nord Stream AG shareholders’ committee, as well as chairman of the board of directors of Russian oil producer Rosneft. Where cold war conditions generated energetic discussions about ideology and military activity, the phoney peace demands that we pay greater attention to transparency and accountability. Growing scrutiny of British engagement with the Chinese party-state reminds us that better regulation of political donations and revolving-door appointments is not just good governance – it is a matter of national security.

Below is a round-up of today’s events. Anti-Kremlin militia claims to have overrun Russian border settlement in Belgorod. Fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launching a cross-border raid, claiming to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. 12 northern European countries met to discuss stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. Defence ministers from the Northern Group met in Poland on Monday where talks described as “very good” by the Polish defence minister were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. The Labour leader also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets” and said “whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has tweeted out his nightly address where he claims Ukraine’s air defence systems have shot down “25 out of 25” Russian drones between Sunday night and Monday morning. The Associated Press reports that defence ministers and senior officials from 12 northern European countries met in Poland on Monday to talk about stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. They gathered near Warsaw as part of the Northern Group, a platform for developing security initiatives for Nato and European Union members. Members of the Northern Group include Britain, Germany, Poland and Finland. After the meeting, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said the “very good” talks were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. He underscored good cooperation with Britain and Sweden, saying the two countries have similar views on threats coming from Russia as it wages war on Ukraine. “We are looking for joint solutions to ensure security,” Błaszczak said. He said Poland’s efforts to obtain early warning planes from Sweden were moving forward. Officials also discussed preparations for the July Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Poland’s proposals for it, Błaszczak said. That summit is expected to gauge prospects for Ukraine’s membership. There have been eight injuries and no deaths as a result of the shelling in the Graivoronsky district in Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor for the region, has said during a live broadcast on the Russian social media network VKontakte. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, has introduced emergency counter-terrorism mesasures, according to this message on Telegram: “In order to ensure the safety of citizens in the Belgorod region, the legal regime of the counter-terrorist operation has been introduced today, which establishes special measures and temporary restrictions. “Starting with the verification of documents proving their identity and ending with the suspension of the activities of hazardous industries and organisations that use explosive, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances.” Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. Starmer said: “As I told President Zelenskiy when I met him in Kyiv, whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” He also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets”. Starmer also urged the prime minister to proscribe the Wagner group as terrorists and “to ensure Britain’s sanctions are not just in place, but enforced”. Speaking beforehand, Sunak said: “When Putin launched his war he gambled that our resolve would falter, but he was wrong then and he is wrong now. “Russia’s military is failing on the battlefield; their economy is failing at home as we tighten the stranglehold on sanctions; and the image of the G7 leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with President Zelenskiy in Hiroshima sent a powerful message to the world: we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.” “Putin should know that we are not going anywhere.” The Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has accused the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of personally ordering the illegal transfer of Ukrainian orphans and suggested he may be guilty of war crimes. Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said “ample evidence” had been gathered indicating the “direct involvement” of Lukashenko and his regime in the deportation of Ukrainian children from territories occupied by Russia to Belarus. “Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the transfers of orphans to Belarus and facilitated their arrival by financial and organisational support,” states a report Tsikhanouskaya sent to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU foreign ministers. Tsikhanouskaya’s team estimates that at least 2,150 children will have been brought to Belarus by the end of this month. Some have been sent to the Dubrava camp in the Minsk region, which is said to be run by Belaruskali, a state-owned potash company and major source of revenue for the Lukashenko regime. The charge sheet against Lukashenko and Belaruskali comes amid growing pressure on the EU to tighten up sanctions against Belarus. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Belarus, including Belaruskali, both for its role in supporting the Russian invasion and the brutal crackdown on protesters after the 2020 elections. However, an extension of the sanctions has been held up for months over the question of whether Belaruskali should be granted an exemption in the name of food security. The European Commission had proposed an exemption for Belaruskali in a belief it would ease global food shortages. Lithuania, backed by Poland, Estonia and Hungary, is refusing to sign off sanctions if an exemption for Belaruskali is included. Vilnius argues that the market is adapting to provide alternatives to Belarusian potash. “It’s our duty not to fall into the trap of Russian propaganda. No lack of fertilisers [and] sanctions against Russia doesn’t cause food insecurity,” the Lithuanian foreign ministry tweeted on Monday. Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, has this roundup of what we know so far about the incident on Belgorod: Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. “We are the same Russians as you,” said a statement put out by the group on social media. “We are distinguished only by the fact that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power and took up arms to defend our and your freedom. But today it’s time for everyone to take responsibility for their future. It’s time to put an end to the Kremlin’s dictatorship.” Other video posted to social media showed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter trailing flares over the town of Kozinka and videos of smoke rising from the settlement with the sounds of emergency sirens clearly audible. The governor of the Belgorod region confirmed an attack on Monday, writing that “sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine have entered the territory of the Grayvoron district. The armed forces of the Russian Federation, together with the border service, Rosgvardiya and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Ukraine has disavowed connection to the Russian partisan fighters, saying that they act independently and are not subject to military control. The head of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has posted another update to Telegram about the outbreak of fighting inside Russia. He wrote: There are three more victims in Grayvoron – two men and one woman with shrapnel wounds, they are in the hospital in a state of moderate severity. All necessary medical assistance is provided. The shells also damaged three private residential buildings, as a result of which they caught fire. There is also a hit on the administration building. In the village of Zamostye, a shell hit a kindergarten, causing it to catch fire. There is also an injured woman with a hand wound, assistance was provided on the spot. Damage information is being updated. Here is what Russian state-owned media Tass is reporting as what it knows about events in Belgorod: The head of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov reported about the penetration of Ukrainian saboteurs into the Grayvoron district. He clarified that the Russian military, border guards, as well as employees of the National Guard and the FSB are taking “the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Prior to this, the governor reported two victims of shelling in the village of Glotovo, Graivoronsky district. According to him, a woman with mine-explosive wounds was taken to intensive care in a serious condition, the man’s condition is assessed as moderate. Later, the Kremlin confirmed that a Ukrainian sabotage group tried to break into the Belgorod region, now it is being squeezed out of Russian territory and destroyed. There are enough forces and means on the spot to fight saboteurs, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, told reporters. He clarified that Putin was informed about the incident. Peskov said that the purpose of the sabotage was “to divert attention from the Bakhmut direction, to minimize the political effect of the loss. Christopher Miller, covering the conflict for the FT, has suggested on Twitter that “Ukrainian incursions into poorly defended Russian settlements along the border could be part of the counteroffensive strategy to keep the Kremlin off balance.” The situation in Belgorod region remains unclear. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has published on its Telegram channel what it says is a message from the Freedom of Russia Legion. They claim to be participating in an attack inside the Russian Federation’s borders. Suspilne writes: “The situation is difficult” in the Belgorod region, the press service of the Freedom of Russia Legion informed us. They said that the Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are creating a demilitarized zone on the border with the Russian Federation, from where the Russian army will not be able to fire at Ukraine. According to them, they will continue to “move towards the liberation of all of Russia.” The Kremlin has claimed that Ukraine is behind the incursion. Ukrainian officials have denied this. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. The report comes after the plant lost external power today for the seventh time during the conflict. The Post says that the plan being pushed by the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has five main points: According to two diplomats familiar with the negotiations, Grossi’s plan includes five principles: a ban on stationing heavy military equipment and military personnel at the plant; a ban on firing from and toward the plant, including a ban on attacking the personnel at the site; protection of all safety and security systems at the plant; protection of all external power lines; and monitoring of compliance of the above-mentioned principles. The Post notes that this appears to be less ambitious than Grossi’s previous proposal of a protection zone around the plant. The plant has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the war, and the Russian Federation has claimed to annex the Zaporizhzhia region, despite not fully controlling the territory. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has distanced Ukraine from events in Belgorod, where there are reports of an armed incursion into Russian territory. He wrote on Twitter: The only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement. Ukraine is watching the events in the Belgorod region of Russia with interest and studying the situation, but it has nothing to do with it. As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store, and underground guerrilla groups are composed of Russian citizens. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of staging an incursion to distract from the Russian claim to have seized full control of Bakhmut at the weekend. Here are some pictures of the destruction caused overnight by what Ukraine claims were Russian strikes in Dnipro city in south-eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian army, Russian forces targeted the Dnipro with 16 missiles and 20 attack drones. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency has reported on its Telegram feed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has been informed about what is claimed to be an attempt to infiltrate the Belgorod region by Ukrainian forces. Citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, it posted: The ministry of defence, the FSB and the border service reported to Putin about an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to break into the Belgorod region, Peskov said. The purpose of the Ukrainian sabotage in the Belgorod region is to divert attention from the situation in the Bakhmut direction, he noted. Russian forces are working to squeeze out the Ukrainian saboteur group from the territory of the Russian Federation and destroy it. There are enough forces and means, the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation added. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s military intelligence service has blamed an armed operation in Belgorod on Russian citizens belonging to two paramilitary groups, Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske said. It quoted military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov as saying the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were responsible for the operation. Tass identified the territory of the Graivoronsky district as the location for the incident. None of the claims have been independently verified. Reuters reports that Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, claimed on Monday that a Ukrainian army “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory in the Graivoron district, which borders Ukraine. On Telegram, Gladkov claimed the Russian army and security forces were taking measures to fight off the incursion. “A sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine has entered the territory of the Graivoronsky district. The Russian armed forces, together with the border service, the Russian guard and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy. I will report the details,” he said. Reuters reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the private Russian army Wagner, repeated his vow to pull his troops out of Bakhmut in three days, and hand over the defence of the newly captured city to regular troops. “On the western edges, defensive positions have been set up, and so Wagner will be leaving Artyomovsk between 25 May and 1 June,” he said, using the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut. “If the Defence Ministry’s own forces aren’t enough, then we have thousands of generals – we just need to put together a battalion of generals, give them all guns, and it’ll all be fine.” Prigozhin has been a vocal critic of the army and defence establishment support that his Wagner mercenaries have received. Moscow’s defence ministry acknowledged that some Russian troops fell back outside Bakhmut last week, but has denied Prigozhin’s repeated assertion that the flanks were crumbling, or that the military had withheld ammunition from Wagner. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned enterprise for the nation’s nuclear power plants, has released a statement on the restoration of power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Ukrainian experts restored the operation of the Dniprovsk 750 kV high-voltage power transmission line, from which the temporarily occupied ZNPP supplies its own needs. The risk of a nuclear and radiation accident is minimised, the situation is stable. We will remind you that on the morning of 22 May, at 5.26am, this line was disconnected as a result of Russian shelling. Since it is the last one that powers the ZNPP, all backup diesel generators are automatically turned on. As a result, the station experienced a blackout for the seventh time since the beginning of the occupation. Earlier one of the Russian-installed leaders of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region claimed it had been Ukraine who had disconnected the power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister says his nation remains open to the idea of giving F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, but no firm position has been arrived at. Rasmussen said: “It doesn’t make sense to train someone to fly a plane if you’ve decided in advance that they can never, ever be allowed to fly the plane. On the other hand, you cannot conclude from this that we have made a decision to donate aircraft.” This follows on from comments earlier this morning where Rasmussen said his nation would like to host a summit in July about finding peace between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence appeared to gave a pictorial response to the proposed peace summit, tweeting a picture of a fighter jet superimposed over a peace symbol, with the caption “Ukraine’s Peace Formula” • This post was amended on 22 May 2023. An earlier version mistakenly identified Rasmussen as the Dutch foreign minister. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Citing Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, Suspilne is reporting that two women have been hospitalised after shelling on Kupiansk. It reports “private houses and civil infrastructure were damaged in the city”. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that the external power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been restored, after an earlier outage forced the plant to rely on emergency diesel generators. It posted to Telegram: Energy workers have restored the power transmission line that feeds the ZNPP. The station is switching to power from the Ukrainian energy system, Ukrenergo reported. Finland’s state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said on Monday it had terminated a contract to buy natural gas from Gazprom Export via pipelines from Russia. Reuters reports Gazprom ceased pipeline-based natural gas deliveries to Gasum in May 2022 in a dispute over payments, and the two sides had been in talks to resolve the matter. Gazprom demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which Finland refused to do. Reuters reports Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has said his nation would like to host a summit in July about how to find peace between Ukraine and Russia, citing the Ritzau news agency. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Novaya Tavolzhanka. Vyacheslav Gladkov posted: In Novaya Tavolzhanka, an explosive device was dropped from a drone next to a private residential building. There were no casualties or damage. The UAV itself fell 100 metres from residential buildings. Explosives and operational services are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city of Bakhmut, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. Reuters reports she said, in televised comments, that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there. In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Russian sources refer to Bakhmut by its Soviet-era name Artemovsk. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels for the Guardian: The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Meeting in Hiroshima over the weekend, leaders of the west’s seven largest economies, plus the heads of the European Commission and Council, pledged to “starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine”. Significantly, they also promised to reduce reliance on civil nuclear goods from Russia and to restrict the trade in diamonds mined, processed or produced in Russia. Nuclear power and diamonds have increasingly been seen as no-go areas for EU sanctions, because of objections from Hungary and Belgium respectively. Hungary, which has signed a contract with Rosatom to build nuclear reactors, has repeatedly threatened to veto any nuclear sanctions, while Belgium, home to one of the world’s largest diamond trading hubs, has used more subtle diplomacy to get the precious stones off EU sanctions lists. The Belgian government argues that an international agreement to stop Russian stones being traded elsewhere in the world is necessary, rather than unilateral EU action. Borrell did not mention any specific sector in his comments. The promise to implement the G7 text comes as EU27 member states continue to spar over the current sanctions proposals, largely aimed at clamping down on companies and countries that help Moscow dodge western measures. Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said talks were well under way and he was confident of an eventual agreement, despite Hungary’s threats to block the latest proposals. Earlier we reported remarks published on the Russian embassy in Washington’s Telegram channel by ambassador Anatoly Antonov, in which he appeared to draw a separate line between attacks on Crimea and attacks on the four regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claimed to annex last year. He said: I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, appears to have retorted to that this morning in a tweet, saying: Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop “Russian aggressions” and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today … The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. In a message on Telegram, Alexander Bogomaz said: The armed forces of Ukraine fired mortars at the village of Khoromnoe in the Klimovsky district. There were no casualties. As a result of the shelling, one household and an outbuilding caught fire. Operational and emergency services are on site. Bryansk region is to the north of Ukraine, and shares its borders with Ukraine and Belarus. The claims have not been independently verified. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. In a tweet, he wrote: Ukraine’s ZNPP this morning lost all external electricity for seventh time during conflict, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for power; nuclear safety situation at the plant extremely vulnerable. We must agree to protect plant now; this situation cannot continue. The Kyiv Post is carrying a video clip which it claims shows damage to one of the fire stations in Dnipro which appears to have been targeted in an overnight attack. Oliver Carroll, foreign correspondent at the Economist, has tweeted one of the images released from the scene, observing “Russia may have targeted emergency services in missile attacks on Dnipro last night. Local authorities reporting massive damage in one of the stations - more than 20 vehicles destroyed.” Other images released by officials in Ukraine show several views of the damage. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure since it began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The former commander of joint forces command Richard Barrons has been on Sky News in the UK, and he was asked what difference sending F-16 planes could make to Ukraine’s war effort. He told viewers: It is a very complex fourth generation aircraft will give Ukraine a decisive advantage over the Russian air force and indeed, over Russian ground forces if they get to the right threshold of capability, and have the family of ammunition that make the aircraft so effective. It would turn the battle in the skies in favour of Ukraine when Ukraine has enough of aircraft, enough competence with it and enough of the family of missiles that make it effective. There’s not much wrong with [the Ukrainian air force], it is certainly full of spirit. But it’s aircraft are mostly Russian aircraft, and therefore well known to the Russians. So they’ve not been able to throw the Russian air force out of the skies, and they’ve relied very heavily on their ground air defences. F-16s will give them the ability to take Ukraine air power over Russian forces in Ukraine. That will be a gamechanger. However, Barrons stressed it was not a short-term project. We should recognise that F-16s will take about 18 months to become combat effective in Ukraine. So what this signals is an expectation on the part of the G7 and others and President Zelenskiy that whatever the outcome of the offensive they’re about to mount, this war will go on into next year. Here is an update on the situation overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Ukraine says at least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one man was wounded in the attack on Dnipro city and seven people were injured on an attack on Synelnykivskyi district of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reuters reports the governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A picture is worth a thousand words and the images from the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend were a good example of that. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was pictured at the centre of a “family portrait” with G7 leaders at the weekend, symbolising their support for the Ukrainian president. Just less than 10 years ago the G7 was the G8 – when Russia was a member of the group and president Vladimir Putin attended summits. Moscow was kicked out in 2014 after the invasion of Crimea. Other pictures showed Zelenskiy being hugged by French president Emmanuel Macron, US president Joe Biden with his arm around him, and sharing smiles and handshakes with other leaders including Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the UK’s Rishi Sunak. More on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with Ukraine’s state-owned power generating company Energoatom confirming that it has experienced a power outage. “Yes, we have the seventh blackout since the start of the [Russian] occupation,” Energoatom told Reuters. Yuriy Malashko, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, said there was a fire at one of the facilities in Zaporizhzhia city due to an overload in the power system. “Problems with electricity supply that arose in the city of Zaporizhzhia are not related to shelling,” Malashko said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: So far Washington is opposing us … by proxy. However, every specialist knows that there is no infrastructure for the use of F-16s in Ukraine, and the required number of pilots and maintenance personnel is not there either. What would happen if American fighters take off from Nato airfields, operated by foreign ‘volunteers’? I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kiev regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Volodymyr Zelenskiy stole the show at the G7 summit, Patrick Wintour writes in his analysis of the weekend, with Zelenskiy’s whirlwind round of diplomacy the culmination of a Ukrainian realisation that for months they have been talking to wrong people. Yes, it is essential to keep lines constantly open to Ukraine’s invested allies in the west, reaping the rewards such as Joe Biden’s decision finally to lift his veto on Ukrainian pilots training to fly US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, but the identification of the west with Ukraine’s cause is almost complete. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks by saying “Slava Ukrajni – Glory to Europe”. But Ukraine for months has known it is not telling its story clearly enough to the phalanx of 40 or so nonaligned states that have abstained at successive UN general assembly votes on the war. India, Brazil, China and as many as 20 African states have sat on the sidelines in the key votes. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been switched to standby and emergency power supply generators, a Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region says.. Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. “(The power) partially disappeared in Zaporizhzhia due to an emergency situation at one of the energy facilities,” Kurtev said on the Telegram messaging app. Explosions were heard in the city of Dnipro overnight as well as in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, with a nationwide air raid alert activated at 3.48am, according to the Kyiv Independent. The city of Odesa was also reportedly hit by Russian combat drones late on Sunday. In a Telegram post, the governor of Dnipro, Serhiy Lysak, said: “Thanks to the defence forces, we withstood the attack.” He later said 15 drones and four cruise missiles had been shot down over the region, while eight people had been injured, including three taken to hospital. Dozens of vehicles were destroyed or damaged as well as nine apartment buildings, several private homes, shops, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, he said. Ukraine’s armed forces have sent a series of photos from Bakhmut, which show some of the extent of the city’s destruction. At the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “I’ll tell you openly: photographs of ruined Hiroshima absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other similar settlements. Nothing left alive, all the buildings ruined.” Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Confusion has reigned as Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out air strikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Here’s our full report on the back-and-forth by Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger: Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said he is “upset” that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. AFP reports: Zelenskiy, who emerged from the summit in Hiroshima with fresh diplomatic support and pledges of more military aid, had sought a one-on-one meeting with Lula, who has faced accusations of being soft on Russia over its invasion. Both leaders said scheduling conflicts had prevented them from meeting – which Zelenskiy quipped had likely left his Brazilian counterpart “disappointed”. “I wasn’t disappointed. I was upset, because I’d like to meet him and discuss the matter,” Lula told a news conference before heading home from Japan. But “Zelenskiy is a grown-up. He knows what he’s doing,” he added. Lula said his team had scheduled a meeting with Zelenskiy for Sunday afternoon. But the Ukrainian leader ran late, and his own agenda was full after that, he said. Lula said he did not see a point in meeting Zelenskiy now, saying neither he nor Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to want peace. “For now, they’re both convinced they’re going to win the war,” he said. Lula is pushing for peace talks and has proposed Brazil as a mediator, along with other “neutral” countries, including China and Indonesia. But the veteran leftist faced criticism last month when he accused the United States of “encouraging” the war. After the White House accused him of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda”, Lula toned down his rhetoric, saying Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion. But he renewed his criticism Monday. US president Joe Biden, he said, is sending the message that “Putin has to surrender and pay for everything he wrecked”. “That message isn’t helping,” he said. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk city of Marinka remain the “epicentre” of the conflict, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, a day after Russia claimed it had completed its “liberation” of the ruined city. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russia had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” Here are other recent developments: Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” and that the forum had become “an ‘incubator’ where, under the leadership of the Anglo-Saxons, destructive initiatives that undermine global stability are prepared”. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April. The head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev will hold talks on Monday with Chen Wenqing, member of the Chinese Communist party’s politburo who oversees police, legal affairs and intelligence, the Russian RIA state news reported. Patrushev, a former chief of the FSB internal security service, is widely seen as one of the most hawkish members of Putin’s inner circle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/30/observer-view-britains-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-30T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain’s energy crisis | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/observer-view-britains-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/observer-view-britains-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Britain’s energy crisis","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Energy is vital to our daily lives. We need reliable supplies to heat our homes, to cook, to keep our food fresh, to power our transport systems, to illuminate our cities and to stay in communication with each other. Ensuring there are no significant disruptions to that provision is one of the most important tasks that a government must perform on behalf of its citizens. In recent months, it has become clear that serious strains are now being placed on energy security in the United Kingdom, however. Spiralling gas costs are causing considerable financial difficulties for thousands of households. At the same time, electricity supplies are now threatened because most of the UK’s ageing nuclear reactors, which currently provide 20% of our electricity, face closure in the next few years with little prospect, at present, of new atomic power plants being ready to fill the gap in lost output. On top of these issues, an urgent overhaul of our use of fossil fuels is required if the country is to have any chance of reaching its goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a promise made by the government as part of its commitment to tackle climate change and to help halt the dangerous warming of our planet. At present, roughly half our electricity is generated by burning natural gas in power plants. About half of that comes to our shores from North Sea rigs whose overall output is dwindling as gas fields reach the end of their lives. The rest of our gas is imported from other nations; most of it is shipped from Qatar or the US or piped from Norway. Very little is imported from Russia, it should be noted. In addition, gas plays a dominant role in heating our homes, a reliance that cannot last for much longer if we are to meet our climate change obligations. In short, we need, as a matter of priority, to replace gas with electricity generated in a safe, renewable, environmentally friendly manner. The nation can achieve this goal in two ways: it can import more electricity from mainland Europe (around 6% of our power already comes via inter-connectors to France, the Netherlands and Ireland) or it can find alternative sources within the UK. The latter path is very much the preferable one, both in terms of establishing security for our energy supply while also ensuring this power is generated in a manner consistent with our carbon emission aspirations. Energy security and fighting climate change are inextricably linked, in other words. This transformation needs to be done as a matter of urgency, however, a point that appears to have escaped ministers whose attempts to reshape power use in the UK have already started to unravel. Consider the government’s green homes grant scheme for England. Hailed by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his green industrial revolution by helping the public make their homes more energy-efficient and less reliant on fossil fuel heating, it targeted a total of 600,000 homes for improvement. In the end, however, only 47,500 were upgraded. As Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, put it last year: “This scheme was a slam dunk fail.” Such setbacks are alarming and underline the urgent need for ministers to provide the nation with a cogent, detailed set of proposals for generating power securely and sustainably while minimising energy waste. Several key issues need to be addressed to achieve these goals. The first is the creation of a system of smart grids. These local networks would distribute power generated from renewable energy sources to supplement mains supplies and reduce electricity bills. Establishing such a system should be seen as a priority for they offer the prospect of making maximum use of power generated within our shores at low cost. Properly insulating buildings would have a similar effect. Despite Johnson’s green homes initiative failure, efforts to make homes and workplaces more energy-efficient should be redoubled. It will not be possible to fit every house in Britain with a heat pump or solar panels. Nevertheless, making more houses and offices greener today will have critical impacts in coming years. Providing power when weather is gloomy and winds are non-existent is also key. At present, nuclear and gas-power plants provide that electricity. The disappearance of the latter over the coming decade will put more pressure on the UK to develop an efficient atomic power programme. Currently, our nuclear plans look piecemeal and unimpressive, despite last week’s announcement of a £100m investment to help develop the Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. Further research is also needed to find new, efficient ways to store energy, so power from renewable sources can be stored for those gloomy, windless days. We also need to find ways to capture and store carbon dioxide from old power plants and so extend their lives. Such developments will be crucial in providing the nation with a full range of options for generating its own power securely and cleanly. The alternative is to sit back and allow these issues to be resolved beyond our shores. In a world where energy will become ever more critical to national survival, that is not an option to be countenanced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/31/rolls-royce-appoints-first-female-finance-chief-helen-mccabe-boardroom-shake-up","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T11:24:08Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce appoints first female finance chief in boardroom shake-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/31/rolls-royce-appoints-first-female-finance-chief-helen-mccabe-boardroom-shake-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/31/rolls-royce-appoints-first-female-finance-chief-helen-mccabe-boardroom-shake-up","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce appoints first female finance chief in boardroom shake-up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce has appointed its first female finance chief as part of a boardroom shake-up by the chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgic, who has promised to instil a “winning culture” at the engineering and aerospace firm, whose past performance he has criticised. Helen McCabe will start in the role later this year, taking over from Panos Kakoullis, who has only been in the job since March 2021. She joins from BP, where she had previously worked alongside Erginbilgic, who was named the CEO of Rolls-Royce last year and took up the role at the start of 2023. Erginbilgic has not been shy about highlighting the 108-year-old engineering firm’s flaws since takeover over, telling staff in January: “We underperform every key competitor out there.” During the address, at Rolls-Royce’s main UK manufacturing side in Derby, he said: “Every investment we make, we destroy value. “We do have a burning platform,” Erginbilgic added, evoking the analogy the former Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop made in 2011 when he told his staff they faced the same stark choice as a worker on an oil platform in the North Sea whose rig was aflame and who had to jump into freezing water to survive. McCabe’s appointment, amid a broader executive overhaul, heralds major reforms at the British engineering champion, whose stock market value has tumbled by two-thirds over the past five years. In a statement to the stock market announcing McCabe’s appointment, Rolls-Royce said the changes were part of a “transformation programme requiring a winning culture and shared determination to deliver sustainable earnings growth and cash generation”. Erginbilgic was head of BP’s downstream division – including global fuels, jet fuels and petrochemicals – for six years, where he worked with McCabe, whose move will end almost three decades with the oil company. He said: “I have experienced her abilities first-hand and her skillset will complement the existing capabilities of the executive team, contributing to Rolls-Royce delivering on its significant potential.” In the shake-up Rob Watson will also become president of the civil aerospace division, having previously run Rolls-Royce’s electric aviation operations. The incumbent head of civil aerospace, Chris Cholerton, will become group president and will oversee the group’s submarine division and serve as the interim boss of the company’s small modular reactor unit until a permanent appointment is made. The division is developing “mini-nukes” to increase the UK’s nuclear power generation capacity. Adam Riddle has been appointed president of defence and will also lead the company’s North America division, with immediate effect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/31/germany-green-party-nuclear-ukraine-die-grunen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Ready to govern?

How Germany’s Green party transformed its reputation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germany’s Green party once made its name campaigning against high military spending, nuclear power and dirty fossil fuels. Since taking office as part of Olaf Scholz’s three-party “traffic light” coalition government last December, however, Die Grünen have become the Bundestag’s most vocal advocates of supporting the Ukrainian resistance with heavy weapons. They have extended the running time of three nuclear power stations due to shut down at the end of the year, reactivated mothballed coal plants and built the country’s first terminals for importing fossil fuel in liquefied form. More surprisingly still, voters seem to like it. Unlike their two power-sharing partners, the centre-left SPD and the liberal FDP, the Greens are currently polling at a higher share of the vote than they achieved at federal elections last September. Their two most prominent politicians, the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and energy minister, Robert Habeck, have the highest approval ratings in the country. One year in, the environmental party can justifiably called one of the first winners of the post-Angela Merkel era. “The Greens have proven that they are ready to govern”, said Andrea Römmele, a professor of political science at Berlin’s Hertie School of Governance. “In politics you campaign in poetry and govern in prose, and they have come across as a party that doesn’t just want to work through their manifesto but engage with new challenges.” Both of the Greens’ leading lights have sought to present theirs as a party of doers, crossing over red lines of old in surprisingly fleet-footed fashion along the way. In spite of having campaigned on the promise to oppose “the export of weapons and armaments into war zones” as recently as September 2021, it was Baerbock who openly questioned Scholz’s reluctance to ship tanks to Ukraine this summer. Seemingly drained of confidence at the end of her unsuccessful run for the chancellery, she has looked in her element since taking charge of the foreign ministry, facing up to Russia’s foreign minister with an unsentimental candour that her predecessors have lacked. On a trip to Nigeria at the start of this week, where Baerbock and the German culture commissioner, Claudia Roth, handed back 20 museum artefacts once looted from the kingdom of Benin, a generational shift between the two former Green party leaders was palpable. Where 67-year-old Roth was enthusiastic and effusive, her 42-year-old party ally showed flashes of steel even at the emotional handover ceremony, at one point using praise of a female royal’s mask to politely reprimand her Nigerian counterpart for the low percentage of women in his government. Baerbock’s former co-leader Habeck, meanwhile, has been forced to make choices that contradict his party’s championing of renewables as Russia’s war in Ukraine upended decades of German energy policy. But he has done so with vigour: under his direction the economic ministry has passed 29 new laws within the first 11 months – his predecessors in each of last three electoral terms managed 40-odd in four years. Habeck has nationalised the energy company Uniper, the country’s largest importer of gas, put the German subsidiaries of Russian companies Rosneft and Gazprom into trusteeships, and managed to fill the country’s gas storage tanks to 100% by the start of winter, in spite of a complete ceasing of deliveries from Russia. If the country can avoid a scenario of gas rationing this winter, it will be in large part due to putting pragmatism above ideological posturing. “This government inherited a complete shambles and is at least showing the kind of ambition and dynamism in trying to clean up the mess that its predecessors lacked,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy expert at the German Economic Institute. “It’s making mistakes – but it’s also getting a lot of things right.” Blaming governments of the past for Germany’s current energy dilemma won’t serve the Greens for the length of a four-year term, however, especially if there is a sense that its own ideological red lines helped create the predicament in the first place. Confidence in Habeck’s ability to steer the economy clear of trouble took a dent over the autumn, as he U-turned on a series of new policies. Putting Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations, due to be phased out by the end of the year, into an “emergency reserve” standby status before announcing two would need to remain on the grid until next April was a cumbersome move, seemingly prioritising procedure over outcome. Since the Greens’ identity is less tailored to Habeck than the SPD’s to Scholz or the FDP’s to the finance minister, Christian Lindner, the reputation damage was limited. Still, for a moment Die Grünen looked like the party of can’t-do. “We have seen a lot of frantic activity in Habeck’s ministry, but not always an underlying sense of direction”, said Uwe Leprich, a climate policy specialist at the Saarland University of Applied Sciences. “He seems to have surrounded himself with advisers who are set on intervening in the market as little as possible,” said Leprich. One of the qualities that enabled Habeck’s and Baerbock’s rise was rhetorical skills that contrasted starkly with the taciturn ways with words of both Scholz and his predecessor as chancellor, Merkel. But such unfamiliar focus on outward-facing communication has also triggered some yearnings for the non-transparent backroom dealings of yesteryear. “A pragmatic business manager may have found a way to continue shipping in some Russian gas to keep down prices, like France and Japan did,” said Leprich. France became the world’s number one importer of Russian liquefied natural gas in April and May, and was still shipping in between 7-9% of its gas requirements from Russia in early September. The Green party’s message, in spite of the temporary and limited extension of nuclear running times, is that Germany can and must go 100% for renewable sources of energy. But while renewable sources are still subject to sudden weather-dependent fluctuations, gas-powered plants that could be quickly switched on and off were a key component of the national energy strategy as sold to the electorate by German governments – including this one. “Natural gas is irreplaceable for the transition period,” says the Scholz cabinet’s coalition treaty signed by the Greens last September. “The debate right now should be: what energy source do we combine renewables with?” said Johannes Güntert of Project Planet A, a small thinktank that tries to pitch an “eco-modernist” alternative to the Green’s current renewables vision. “The German Greens, who were founded as an anti-nuclear rather than a climate protection party, are sadly not unbiased in answering that question.” If high gas prices and energy shortages force German businesses to close down or relocate in the coming 12 months, the Greens may need to search even more deeply in their party’s soul to retain a reputation as the doers of this government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/drone-attack-hits-oil-storage-tank-airfield-russia-kursk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T09:42:20Z","webTitle":"Drone attack hits oil storage tank at airfield in Russia’s Kursk region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/drone-attack-hits-oil-storage-tank-airfield-russia-kursk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/drone-attack-hits-oil-storage-tank-airfield-russia-kursk","fields":{"headline":"Drone attack hits oil storage tank at airfield in Russia’s Kursk region","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv or Moscow. Russian officials blamed Monday’s attacks on modified Strizh drones, which were first produced in the 1970s in the Soviet era and intended for use as target practice. Ukrainian attacks on Russian military targets have become increasingly bold in recent weeks as Kyiv has sought to bring Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine to the home front. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that Ukrainian drones had attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, and damaging two aircraft. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for any of the attacks. However, a senior Ukrainian official, quoted by the New York Times, said the drones involved in Monday’s attacks were launched from Ukrainian territory and at least one of the strikes was made with the help of special forces close to the base. The Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at Dyagilevo airbase in Ryazan. Russia’s defence ministry said Monday’s attacks were acts of terrorism intended to disable long-range aircraft, and that the low-flying drones used were shot down. Saratov is at least 370 miles from the nearest Ukrainian territory. Russian commentators said on social media that if Ukraine could strike that far inside Russia, it may also be capable of hitting Moscow. The Ukrainian military analyst Serhiy Zgurets said the air force bases hit on Monday were the only facilities in Russia that could fully service bombers used to launch attacks on Ukraine. “It is still too early to say what is at issue here, but the ability of the armed forces of Ukraine to reach military targets deep in the territory of the Russian Federation has a very symbolic and important meaning,” he wrote on the website of Ukraine’s Espreso TV. The latest drone attack came as a Russian official appeared to reject recent claims that Moscow may be nearing a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to pull back from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “Russian withdrawal from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant or transferring control over it to some ‘third party’ is out of the question,” said the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, had said last week he hoped to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the nuclear plant, which is occupied by Russia, by the end of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/27/whats-plan-b-if-the-government-cant-attract-investors-willing-to-fund-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-27T00:01:16Z","webTitle":"What’s plan B if the government can’t attract investors willing to fund Sizewell C? | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/27/whats-plan-b-if-the-government-cant-attract-investors-willing-to-fund-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/27/whats-plan-b-if-the-government-cant-attract-investors-willing-to-fund-sizewell-c","fields":{"headline":"What’s plan B if the government can’t attract investors willing to fund Sizewell C?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A sum of £100m is peanuts in the expensive world of nuclear power stations, so regard the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng’s funding for a round of development work on Sizewell C as a form of advertising. The cash is intended to send a message that the government is serious about getting the plant built in Suffolk. And it is an appeal for outside investors to volunteer to sit alongside developer EDF, the French state-backed group. There was also a definition of a desirable investor: “British pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors from like-minded countries”. Note the nationality test. It is the closest we have come to official confirmation that China General Nuclear (CGN), originally slated for a 20% stake in Sizewell, will be kicked off the project. It remains to be seen how, legally, the government will rip up the 2015 deal with CGN signed by David Cameron’s government, but the intention is clear. So, too, is the intended funding mechanism. It will be a regulated asset base (RAB) model, a version of the formula used at Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Thames Tideway giant sewer. The key point for investors is that they will see some income before Sizewell is built, unlike at Hinkley Point C where EDF and CGN earn their princely cashflows only when the electricity starts to flow. The switch will lower Sizewell’s lifetime costs by “more than £30bn” versus Hinkley’s contracts-for-difference model, says the government, being economical with the economics. What it doesn’t mention is that any cost overrun (a real risk given nuclear’s reliable record of never hitting its construction budgets) will be shoved on to consumers, who will in any case see £10 a year added to household energy bills during the build phase. But, yes, Kwarteng is correct that the RAB model is the only one with a chance of attracting new investors. What, though, if those British and like-minded institutions still refuse to play? Nuclear represents unknown territory for most of them. What if competition to invest, which is meant to be the other way in which RAB lowers financing costs, doesn’t materialise? What’s the government’s plan B? The only possible solution is for the state to invest directly. If that is so, wouldn’t it be better to run an upfront benchmarking exercise at the outset to compare the numbers? Sizewell, unfortunately, is probably inevitable given the current panic over high gas prices and long-term energy security. But taxpayers, on the hook anyway via household bills, deserve to know that the odd billion or three isn’t being diverted unnecessarily to intermediaries. By the time Sizewell’s sums become enormous, transparency will be essential. The government has just thrown £1.7bn at Bulb, the failed energy supplier, to keep it on life support and it will be a miracle if all the cash comes back in full. In that context, using public money to invest in a productive energy asset doesn’t seem such an awful prospect. Agnew resignation turns spotlight on UK counter-fraud strategy Theodore Agnew’s dramatic resignation as counter-fraud minister this week has stung Rishi Sunak. So it should. “A combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance freezes the government machine” in dealing with Covid fraud, said the outgoing minster, which is a heavy charge. Cue a series of tweets from the chancellor on Wednesday about how he is not ignoring or “writing off” the problem. In one respect, one can sympathise with Sunak. In the early stage of the pandemic, it was indeed important to get money out of the door quickly to small businesses. Some level of fraud was inevitable. Perfection was impossible. The question posed by Lord Agnew, though, is different. Is the government chasing the fraudsters as hard as it could? It was also the challenge set by the National Audit Office last month when it reviewed the £47bn bounceback loan scheme, which is estimated by the business department to have generated £4.9bn of fraudulent loans. The NAO’s advice was clear: the government should produce a formal strategy for managing bounceback loan fraud; it should set targets for success; it should report on the performance of each counter-fraud measure; it should assess resources regularly. In short, inject professionalism and accountability into the process. Is the £100m that Sunak said has been invested into the taxpayer protection taskforce enough? It is hard to tell until the government sets public targets for how much could be recouped. Until then, the suspicion will remain that fraud levels are, as Agnew put it, “a multiple of what should be happening”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/vladimir-putin-mass-strikes-ukraine-temporary-cheer-russian-hardliners","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T13:46:51Z","webTitle":"Mass strikes on Ukraine are a desperate answer to Putin’s critics at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/vladimir-putin-mass-strikes-ukraine-temporary-cheer-russian-hardliners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/vladimir-putin-mass-strikes-ukraine-temporary-cheer-russian-hardliners","fields":{"headline":"Mass strikes on Ukraine are a desperate answer to Putin’s critics at home","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The victims were ordinary Ukrainians: those who died at the busy intersection of Volodymyrska and Shevchenko streets in Kyiv, at a downtown playground, or the hundreds of thousands now in homes without light, water and heat in cities across the country due to a barrage of Russian cruise missiles. But Vladimir Putin’s “mass strikes” on Monday were also a desperate answer to his military’s critics at home, to the fact that Russia’s invasion is failing, and to his own wounded pride after the Crimean Bridge, a pet project, was rocked by an explosion this weekend. “What he is doing now is trivial revenge,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Personal revenge as well.” For months, Russian war pundits, armchair generals, military bloggers and others have been clamouring for all-out war against Ukraine. And, as the horrific images began to appear from Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Lviv and Dnipro of bodies in the streets and plumes of smoke rising from city centres, they were satisfied for a moment. “We warned you, Zelenskiy, that Russia still had not begun in earnest,” wrote Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-installed head of Chechnya, who had criticised top army generals in recent weeks. “Now I’m 100% satisfied with how the [war] is being waged.” When Putin led a session of his security council on Monday, he presented the attack as a case of Russia demanding action following the explosion that rocked the Crimean Bridge, a symbol of Russian prestige and of his control of the peninsula. “It was impossible to leave this kind of crime without any response,” Putin said in televised remarks, blaming the blast on Ukrainian intelligence. Ukrainian officials quickly pointed out that Russia had been launching strikes against civilian infrastructure since the beginning of the war. Russia’s strike on Monday was the largest barrage against cities since 24 February, but not a fundamental change to the war. “No, Putin was not ‘provoked’ to unleash missile terror by ‘Crimea Bridge’,” wrote Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “Russia had been constantly hitting Ukraine with missiles before the bridge, too. Putin is desperate because of battlefield defeats and uses missile terror to try to change the pace of war in his favour.” In his short speech, Putin claimed the strikes were made at the “request of the defence ministry”. If true, that would make it one of the first decisions enacted by Gen Sergei Surovikin, the new unified Russian battlefield commander who has been dubbed “General Armageddon” for his hardline and unorthodox approach to waging war. “I am not surprised to see what is happening this morning in Kyiv. Surovikin is absolutely ruthless, with little regard for human life,” a former defence ministry official who has worked with him told the Guardian. “I am afraid his hands will be completely covered in Ukrainian blood.” At the same time, Putin said that attacks such as Monday’s mass barrage of missiles would be reserved as responses to strikes on Russian territory. Whether or not that is true, the statement is one that will anger hardliners who believed they were witnessing Russia’s new, all-out approach to this war. “We must hope that this is not a one-time act of revenge but a new system of waging war,” Alexander Kots, a hawkish military reporter for the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote before Putin spoke. “Across the entire Ukrainian government. Until they lose the ability to function.” Whatever praise Putin has earned from the military’s critics by using cruise missiles to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine may be short-lived. “Russian public opinion wants mass attacks and the total destruction of infrastructure that can be used by the Ukrainian army,” claimed Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser and political commentator. He, like other pro-Kremlin figures, have mostly ignored the fact that the strikes also targeted ordinary civilians. The complexities of the Kremlin’s internal decision-making on the war remain opaque. While the infighting among Russian officials has been palpable in recent weeks, Putin has also made clear that the war is deeply personal for him, and often launches into tirades on Ukrainian statehood and history that put him in line with some of the most hardline elements of his government. “Perhaps it is important for Putin to respond to the discontent of hawks and ultra-conservatives. But I would not exaggerate their influence on the decisions he makes,” said Kolesnikov. “He is himself the most important hawk and ultra-conservative. This war is his personal war with Ukraine and, as it turned out eight months later, with the world order constructed after 1945 and 1991.” One theory in Moscow is that Putin has sought to reduce anger over the defence ministry’s conduct of the war by appointing a new military commander with a brutal reputation to show that the military now has carte blanche. Surovikin is in favour with hardliners. He maintains a good working relationship with the Wagner private military company, said Gleb Irisov, a former air force lieutenant who worked with Surovikin up to 2020, and his appointment was welcomed by top critics of the war effort, including Kadyrov and the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin. “[Surovikin] is very cruel but also a competent commander,” said Irisov. “But he won’t be able to solve all the problems. Russia is short on weapons and manpower,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T17:55:45Z","webTitle":"Russian forces in Bakhmut pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, claims Ukraine military commander – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces in Bakhmut pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, claims Ukraine military commander – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the time is approaching 9pm in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, here is a roundup of today’s news. A Ukrainian military commander has said that Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, after counteroffensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers.” Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in a border area between Russia and Ukraine had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters. It comes as Ukraine’s military said its forces have seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, made up of thousands of troops. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut but Moscow was increasingly forced to use regular army units because of heavy losses among the Wagner private army group. The Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner group is fighting in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the brigade had abandoned its positions. Russia has not commented. Prigozhin has complained that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry – which has promised to ensure all combat units have the resources they need – had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters. The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Wagner group terrorists. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. Britain is also set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organisation to increase pressure on Russia, the Times reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported, citing a government source. Russian forces are planning to “evacuate” more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a “catastrophic lack” of personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company claimed on Wednesday. Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory. However, Ukraine has said that Russia is now blocking the exit of the thousands it had organised to leave Enerhodar. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been criticised again for his links to Russia after attending a Victory Day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Schröder was seen at the reception on Tuesday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the far-left Linke party. Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe that it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The decree formally appoints the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to represent Putin during parliamentary proceedings on denouncing the treaty, which aimed to regulate the number of forces deployed by Warsaw Pact and Nato countries. Russia announced in 2015 that it was completely halting its participation in the treaty, having already suspended cooperation in 2007. Russia argues that the treaty, which was intended to balance conventional forces towards the end of the cold war, was de facto in breach because former Soviet republics such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Warsaw Pact nations such as Bulgaria, had become members of Nato by the early 2000s. The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region, but failed. Tass reports that the Russian Federation security service, the FSB, has claimed to have prevented an assassination attempt on a police chief in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, has spoken in Brussels at a meeting of Nato’s military committee. He said the alliance needs to “redouble our efforts” in order to provide security to the 1 billion people in Nato countries, citing what he claimed was a range of rising threats. More news on the killing of Arman Soldin on Tuesday. French judges have launched a war crimes investigation into the journalist’s death in Ukraine, anti-terror prosecutors said Wednesday. Soldin, 32, died when he and his Agence France-Presse colleagues came under fire by Grad rockets on Tuesday while they were with Ukrainian troops near Chasiv Yar, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The French inquiry will be handled by the OCLCH, an investigating unit specialising in crimes against humanity and hate crimes, and will seek to determine the exact circumstances of Soldin’s death, the prosecutors said, according to AFP. Soldin’s death brings to at least 11 the number of journalists, fixers or drivers for media teams killed since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, according to advocacy groups. Russian shelling has killed a woman in Kherson oblast’s Kakhovskyi district on the Dnipro river, the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office reported on Wednesday. Russian forces reportedly shelled the district at about 5pm. The attack also damaged residential buildings and farms in the area. An investigation is under way and the prosecutor general’s office said that a war crimes inquiry had been launched. The UN’s special rapporteur on torture has called on Russia to provide jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny with “urgent and comprehensive” medical care following reports that his health is deteriorating. Navalny’s supporters have said he was suffering from significant stomach pain in jail, which they said could be a sign of some sort of slow-acting poison. “I am distressed by the deteriorating state of Navalny’s health and the apparent lack of satisfactory diagnosis and medical treatment,” Alice Edwards said in a statement. Russia’s penitentiary service has previously denied allegations that its employees have mistreated Navalny and has said he has always been granted medical treatment when needed. Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated for what western laboratory tests showed was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia in 2020. “He must immediately and continuously be provided with adequate care, including comprehensive medical check-ups, treatment and monitoring of his health situation in a civil hospital,” Edwards said. Navalny, 46, is serving combined sentences of 11 and a half years for fraud and contempt of court on charges he says were trumped up to silence him. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder is in trouble again for his links to Russia after attending a victory day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Schröder, who has previously been criticised for his links to Russia, was seen at the reception on Tuesday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the far-left Linke party. The two parties have been critical of the sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The former Social Democrat chancellor is seen at the event in a photo published by the German daily Bild. Schroeder has not yet commented on his presence at the reception. Schröder, who held a number of positions in Russian energy companies, has seen many of the privileges normally given to ex-chancellors taken away for his ties to the Kremlin. Schröder no longer has a publicly funded private office, but members of current chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats have so far failed to expel his predecessor from the party. “I find it incomprehensible,” senior Social Democrat MP Katja Mast said in response to Schröder’s attendance. “Gerhard Schröder’s behaviour can hardly be surpassed in its tastelessness,” said senior conservative (CDU) politician Thorsten Frei. “On the day the former chancellor was entertained by Russian diplomats, innocent people in Ukraine died as a result of the Russian war of aggression,” Frei said. Scholz’s spokesperson declined to comment on the reception at a regular press conference Wednesday. Also seen at the embassy party was the former East German leader Egon Krenz. A Ukrainian military commander has said that Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, after counteroffensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. It comes as Ukrainian forces claim to have routed a brigade of thousands of Russian troops in Bakhmut. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers. ”It was the competent conduct of the defensive operation that exhausted the trained forces of the ‘Wagner’ PvC and forced them to be replaced in certain directions by less well-prepared units of the Russian regular troops, which were defeated and left.” Tributes have been paid to an Agence France-Presse journalist who has been killed in Ukraine. Arman Soldin was killed when an AFP team came under fire by Grad rockets while they were with a group of Ukrainian soldiers near Bakhmut, the epicentre of the fighting for months. His death brings to at least 11 the number of journalists, fixers or drivers for media teams killed since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, according to advocacy groups. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, paid tribute to Soldin’s “courage” and described his work as “essential” to understanding the facts around the war in Ukraine. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “Arman was a talented and courageous journalist and his death is obviously devastating for those who knew him.” “Journalism continues to shine a light in the darkness of this war, and Arman’s work was vital to that. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk region where Bakhmut lies and which has been partially controlled by Kremlin-backed forces for years, offered his condolences to Soldin’s friends and family. “I thank everyone who – risking their own lives – continues to tell the truth about our war,” he said. Some more on the claims earlier that the Ukrainian army has partially destroyed a Russian brigade that has been fighting in Bakhmut. Moscow has not commented on the reports that its 72nd separate motor rifle brigade had abandoned its positions on the south-western outskirts of Bakhmut. Russia’s ministry of defence did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Reuters said it was unable to independently confirm the situation on the ground. A Russian brigade is typically formed of several thousand troops. The eastern Ukrainian city has been the primary target of Moscow’s huge winter offensive and scene of the bloodiest ground combat in Europe since the second world war. Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has repeatedly accused Moscow’s regular armed forces of failing to adequately support his private army leading the fight in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the Russian brigade had abandoned its positions. “Our army is fleeing. The 72nd Brigade pissed away three square km this morning, where I had lost around 500 men,” Prigozhin said. In a statement overnight, Ukraine’s Third Separate Assault Brigade said: “It’s official. Prigozhin’s report about the flight of Russia’s 72nd Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade from near Bakhmut and the ‘500 corpses’ of Russians left behind is true.” “The Third Assault Brigade is grateful for the publicity about our success at the front.” Early on Wednesday the Ukrainian unit, which was formed last year from the nationalist Azov battalion, reposted a video of one of Azov’s founders, Andriy Biletsky, who said his forces had “defeated” the Russian brigade. “In fact, the 6th and 7th squadrons of this brigade were almost entirely destroyed, brigade intelligence was destroyed, a large number of fighting vehicles were destroyed a considerable number of prisoners were taken,” he said. Canada and Latvia will become the latest countries to help train Ukrainian troops. They will jointly lead Ukrainian soldiers on Latvian soil from 15 May, the Canadian defence minister, Anita Anand, said on Wednesday. The training programme will complement other Canadian efforts to train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK and in Poland, said Anand, speaking to reporters alongside her Latvian counterpart, Ināra Mūrniece, in Ottawa. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree calling up military reservists for training in 2023, according to a document published on Wednesday on a government website. The training of these Russian citizens, who are in the armed forces reserve, is a planned annual event. Reservists were partially mobilised in September last year, as the Kremlin looked to bolster its forces in the midst of a swift counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin complained on Wednesday that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry to underpin what he claimed was their advance in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry – which has promised to ensure that all combat units have the resources they need – had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but that there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters. “We’re scraping by with a minimal quantity of shells,” he said, adding his mercenaries were nonetheless continuing to advance in Bakhmut. Prigozhin said the Russian leadership had asked the defence ministry to check the status of Wagner’s shell request, but that bureaucracy meant the process was a slow one. Late last week Prigozhin posted a video of an expletive-laden tirade addressed at senior Russian army officials while standing in what appeared to be a field of Russian corpses. He accused officials of “getting fat” in their offices while his troops died. He subsequently threatened in public to withdraw Wagner forces from Bakhmut, a Ukrainian city Russia has spent ten months trying to take. Germany will buy an additional 50 Puma fighting vehicles worth €1.5bn (£1.3bn/$1.65bn) for its armed forces, two participants in the parliamentary budget committee which approved the purchase on Wednesday have told Reuters. Berlin has ramped up defence spending after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, both sending weapons to Kyiv and replenishing its own military stocks. Ukraine’s military has said its forces have seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, and that the eastern city remained Moscow’s main target. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut but that Moscow was increasingly forced to use regular army units because of heavy losses among the Wagner private army group. The Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose private Wagner group is fighting in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the brigade had abandoned its positions. “Unfortunately they have not destroyed the whole [Russian] brigade yet, two companies have been seriously damaged there,” Cherevatyi said in televised comments. “The situation [in Bakhmut] remains difficult because for the enemy, despite all the white noise Prigozhin is trying to create, it [Bakhmut] is the main direction of attack, the main coveted target.” France has asked China to make clear to Russia that Moscow is in an “impasse” in its war with Ukraine, as Beijing seeks to mediate in the conflict. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, told a cabinet meeting that Beijing should urge Russia to “return to peace”, according to a post-cabinet press briefing Reuters has reported. “It is necessary for China to use its relations with Russia to make Russia understand better that it is at an impasse, and to tell Russia to come back to its senses,” she said. The request comes after French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited China last month and sparked controversy by saying that Europe should not be a “follower” of either Washington or Beijing or get caught up in any escalation over the future of Taiwan. The remarks sparked much comment, including from the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, who called them “unfortunate”, adding: “We have never been in danger of becoming or being a vassal of the United States.” The Ukrainian army has claimed that Russia is stopping workers and their relatives from leaving Zaporizhzhia, despite organising their evacuation from the area near the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant. On Wednesday Ukraine’s state-owned energy company, Energoatom, said it had been told that about 3,100 people were to be withdrawn from the southern city from Enerhodar, including 2,700 who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. Warnings have frequently been issued over how dangerous the situation at the power plant has been since the invasion last year. However the situation looks murkier than first thought. In its daily update on Wednesday morning, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said: In Enerhodar, the Russian occupiers organised a so-called “evacuation” for family members of Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant] employees. Yet the employees of the power plant are not allowed to leave the city. The so-called “authorities” put in office by the occupation forces announced the evacuation to recreation centres and hotels of Berdiansk and Kyrylivka. However, those who agreed were taken to Rostov oblast [in Russia] and placed in tent camps. Two Ukrainian civilians were killed and five were wounded in Russian attacks on Tuesday. The preliminary figures come from the country’s military media centre. Russian forces used shells in attacks on 126 settlements across Ukraine, it said. In a statement on Telegram, it said: “According to the information provided by the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russian troops shelled nine regions of Ukraine in the past day. “In total, 126 settlements were shelled with various types of weapons (mortars, tanks, artillery, MLRS, air defense systems, UAVs and tactical aircraft) and 153 infrastructure facilities were hit. According to preliminary reports, two people were killed and five were wounded,” the report said. Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in an border area between Russia and Ukraine had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters. “Yes, indeed, early this morning there was an attempt to commit a terrorist act against the Druzhba oil pipeline system at the Bryansk filling station,” Transneft’s spokesman told Tass. “As a result, no one was hurt. The competent authorities are investigating the circumstances of the incident.” Early on Wednesday, Baza, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s law enforcement agencies, reported that three empty oil reservoirs at the Druzhba pipeline’s filling station came under attack. It said there were no leaks following the attacks. Russian oil supplies via the Soviet-built pipeline have not been sanctioned, however, European countries are scaling back usage of the route amid wider sanctions against Moscow. The Druzhba pipeline was attacked several times after the start of what Kremlin casts as a special military operation in Ukraine last February. The Kremlin has declined to comment on the progress of talks aimed at extending the Black Sea grain deal, which facilitates the export of grain from Ukrainian ports. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement when it ends on 18 May unless what it calls obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports are lifted. Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian Tass news agency suggested that an agreement was close (see 9.46am). Ukraine has sought a longer term extension, and suggested that it would like to see additional ports included in the deal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia’s position was well known and that work on the deal was under way. Two Russian soldiers from Kamchatka in the far east of Russia have been jailed for two and a half years in prison for refusing to fight in Ukraine, human rights group OVD-Info said on Wednesday. In separate rulings, the men, identified in military court documents as Alexander Stepanov and Andrei Mikhailov, were found guilty of refusing orders to go into combat during wartime, Reuters reports. Russian president Vladimir Putin amended the criminal code last year to include prison sentences of up to three years for refusing to fight. Putin ordered the mobilisation of an extra 300,000 troops last September to bolster Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, where the army has sustained heavy losses in nearly 15 months of war. The move, unprecedented since the second world war, prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being called up. The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Russian mercenary group Wagner as terrorists, as the UK reportedly prepares to do the same. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. Britain is also set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organization to increase pressure on Russia, the Times of London newspaper reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported citing a government source. Russian forces are planning to “evacuate” more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a “catastrophic lack” of personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company claimed on Wednesday. Ukraine’s Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory. Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe that it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The decree formally appoints deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov to represent Putin during parliamentary proceedings on denouncing the treaty, which aimed to regulate the number of forces deployed by Warsaw Pact and Nato countries. Russia announced in 2015 that it was completely halting its participation in the treaty, having already suspended cooperation in 2007. Russia argues that the treaty, which was intended to balance conventional forces towards the end of the cold war, was de facto in breach because former Soviet republics like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Warsaw pact nations like Bulgaria had become members of Nato by the early 2000s. The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region, but failed.

Ukraine’s Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. “The Russian occupiers are proving their inability to ensure the operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as there is now a catastrophic lack of qualified personnel,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging service. “Even those Ukrainian workers who, having signed shameful contracts, … are going to be ‘evacuated’ soon. And this will exacerbate the already extremely urgent issue of having a sufficient number of personnel to ensure the safety of operation of the NPP (nuclear power plant) even in the current shutdown state.” Last week, the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said the situation around the Russian-held nuclear station had become “potentially dangerous” after Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas. Russia’s Tass state news agency said on Monday the Moscow-installed governor of the Russia-controlled part of the surrounding region had suspended operations at the plant. Reuters said it was not able to independently verify the reports, and Russia did not immediately comment. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe, and has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused the other side of endangering nuclear safety by firing at the plant. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory. Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe that it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.

Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carry a report from a source in Ankara hinting that the Black Sea grain initiative may be closer to an extension. Moscow has insisted the deal expires on 18 May, claiming that western sanctions in areas such as banking and insurance are preventing it exporting its own agricultural products. Ukraine has sought a longer term extension, and suggested that it would like to see additional ports included in the deal. Tass quotes its source saying: There is information that the deal will eventually be extended after May 18. That’s why I’m talking about it as a fact. And there are expectations that the export of Russian products will be included in it. For President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the extension of the deal is a signal to the west that Turkey can be trusted. Therefore, the authorities will do everything possible to continue the grain initiative The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region, but failed. “As a result of intervention measures, one of them veered off course and went down, while the second was destroyed by gunfire,” Reuters reports governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram. Voronezh is to the east of Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, which both border Ukraine, and it shares a border with Luhansk, one of the occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Tass reports that the Russian Federation security service, the FSB, has claimed to have prevented an assassination attempt on a police chief in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. It reports the FSB said in a statement: The FSB … prevented an attempt on the life of one of the leaders of the law enforcement agencies of the Zaporizhzhia region. The first victim of the attacker was to be the head of the police department in the village of Kirillovka [which is on the Sea of Azov coast, south of Melitopol]. When trying to detain the criminal, he offered armed resistance, but thanks to the professional actions of the special forces of the FSB of Russia, he was disarmed. Tass reports that “components for the manufacture of an improvised explosive device were found at the detainee’s place of residence” and that the man was “a citizen of Ukraine, aged 31, who arrived in the Zaporizhzhia region to carry out sabotage and terrorist activities. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this round-up of the latest developments overnight. It writes on its official Telegram channel: In Bakhmut, fighters of the 3rd brigade of the armed forces of Ukraine advanced 2.6km during the storming of Russian positions for two days and defeated two companies of the 72nd brigade of the Russian Federation, said the commander of the “Azov” regiment. Air defence forces destroyed three Russian drones over Dnipropetrovsk region on the night of 10 May. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Kherson heavily. More than 350 projectiles were fired in Kherson oblast during the day: one person was injured. In Zaporizhzhia, the Russian army shelled 19 settlements yesterday: a resident of the village of Mykilske was seriously injured. The claims have not been independently verified. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, has been speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato’s military committee. He has said the alliance needs to “redouble our efforts” in order to provide security to the 1 billion people in Nato countries, citing what he claimed was a range of rising threats. He told military leaders: The transformation of our alliance over the last decade has been nothing short of remarkable. Since Russia illegally annexed Crimea and entered into eastern Ukraine in 2014, we have increased the readiness of our forces. We have deployed combat troops to the east of the alliance for the first time in our history, and European allies and Canada have spent an additional $350bn extra on defence. When President Putin launched his full fledge invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we were therefore ready. Within hours, we activated all our defence plans. We put 40,000 troops under Nato command, backed by significant air and maritime power, and we strengthened our forward defences from the Baltic to the Black Sea. These actions reduce the risk of miscalculation and escalation beyond Ukraine, by making crystal clear that we will defend every inch of Nato territory. Stoltenberg went on to say: As we prepare for a more dangerous future, we must redouble our efforts to keep our one billion citizens safe, and to uphold the rules-based international order. High intensity warfare is back in Europe, global competition is rising, authoritarian regimes are challenging our values, interests and security, and other threats are also multiplying – from terrorism to cyber-attacks, from nuclear proliferation to climate change. So we need to step up for this new era of strategic competition. Nato’s military committee is meeting in Brussels, and the session has just opened. We will bring you any key lines that emerge. One session is dedicated specifically to discussing Russia and Ukraine. Finland is participating in person as a member for the first times. Adm Rob Bauer, chair of the Nato military committee, has said in his opening remarks that Russia is in the fifteenth month of its planned three day war, and that the committee will be hearing directly from Ukrainian military voices. Here is a little more detail from the Times of London in its report that the UK government may be planning to designate the Wagner mercenary group as a terrorist organisation, following the lead of Estonia, France and Lithuania. The paper writes: [Wagner founder Yevgeny] Prigozhin, 61, was able to use British courts to bring a libel case against Eliot Higgins, a British journalist, after revelations by his website Bellingcat about the group’s shadowy operations. The case collapsed in March last year after the outbreak of war in Ukraine and personal sanctions imposed on Prigozhin, but government sources said it was an example of how proscription could help to prevent Wagner’s influence and operations in the UK. There has not been evidence that Wagner or individuals linked to it are operating in the UK since the war in Ukraine started and proscription is largely seen as a symbolic move. However, a government source said there had been “suspicions” that the group had helped launder money out of the UK along with organised crime groups after financial sanctions were imposed against Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in the wake of the war. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily intelligence update, saying yesterday’s Victory Day parades in Russia, “highlighted the materiel and strategic communications challenges the military is facing 15 months into the war in Ukraine”. The full update reads: On 09 May 2023, the make-up of Russia’s annual Victory Day Parade in Red Square highlighted the materiel and strategic communications challenges the military is facing 15 months into the war in Ukraine. Over 8,000 personnel reportedly took part in the parade, but the majority were auxiliary, paramilitary forces, and cadets from military training establishments. The only personnel from deployable formations of regular forces were contingents of Railway Troops and military police. A vintage T-34 from a ceremonial unit was the sole tank on parade. Despite heavy losses in Ukraine, Russia could have fielded more armoured vehicles. The authorities likely refrained from doing so because they want to avoid domestic criticism about prioritising parades over combat operations. Being listed as a terrorist organisation means EU members could freeze assets of the Wagner group and its members, with European companies and citizens barred from dealing with the group. Prigozhin had his assets in the European Union frozen in 2020 and was placed on a visa blacklist over the deployment of Wagner fighters to war-torn Libya, a decision he unsuccessfully appealed. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, conceded to lawmakers on Tuesday that legally the EU terrorist label would not have any “direct supplemental effect” on the group. But “we should not underestimate the symbolic importance of such a designation, nor the dissuasive effect that it could have on states tempted to turn” to Wagner. In the UK, the blacklisting would make it a criminal offence to belong to Wagner, attend its meetings, encourage support for it, or carry its logo in public, the Times said. It would impose financial sanctions on the group and there would be implications for Wagner’s ability to raise money if any funds went through British financial institutions. On Tuesday, the Times newspaper reported that after two months of building a legal case, Britain would also formally list Wagner as a terrorist organisation to increase pressure on Russia. Citing a government source, the Times said the blacklisting was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks. Britain’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters reports that Russia’s air defence forces shot down an “enemy” drone in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, its governor said on Wednesday, adding that falling debris damaged a gas pipeline and a house. “Debris fell in the village of Tolmachevo. No one was hurt,” the regional governor, Roman Starovoyt, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia and on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. However, Kyiv has recently said that undermining Russia’s logistics is part of preparation for a planned counteroffensive The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Russian mercenary group Wagner as terrorists, as the UK reportedly prepares to do the same. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. “Wherever they work, Wagner members spread instability and violence,” MP Benjamin Haddad told parliament on Tuesday. “They kill and torture. They massacre and pillage. They intimidate and manipulate with almost total impunity.” He said they were not simple mercenaries driven by an “appetite for money” but they “follow a broad strategy, from Mali to Ukraine, of supporting the aggressive policies of President [Vladimir] Putin’s regime towards our democracies”. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: the French parliament has unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. And Russia’s air defence forces shot down an “enemy” drone in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, its governor said on Wednesday, adding that falling debris damaged a gas pipeline and a house. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner force said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. Arman Soldin, a 32-year-old video journalist for Agence France Presse in Ukraine, was killed by Grad rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, in eastern Ukraine, AFP said on Twitter, citing AFP colleagues who witnessed the incident. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war, as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue. Ukraine said its air defences shot down 23 of 25 missiles, fired overnight by Russia, chiefly at Kyiv, and there were no reported casualties. It was the second night in a row of major Russian airstrikes and fifth so far this month. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hailed Ukraine as “the beating heart of today’s European values”. Zelenskiy discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with Von der Leyen in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/a-visit-to-moscow-on-the-eve-of-the-olympics-1980","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-05T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"A visit to Moscow on the eve of the Olympics, 1980","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/a-visit-to-moscow-on-the-eve-of-the-olympics-1980","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/a-visit-to-moscow-on-the-eve-of-the-olympics-1980","fields":{"headline":"A visit to Moscow on the eve of the Olympics, 1980","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On the eve of the Moscow Olympics, the Observer Magazine (5 July 1980) visited ‘the city Margaret Thatcher doesn’t want our athletes to see’ to discover what Moscow life was really like. ‘It is easy to conclude that all Russians going impassively about their business must be some sort of automatons,’ the dossier mused. ‘The clues to the hearts of these disciplined and watched-over people are rare, and consequently startling and precious when one discovers them.’ Writers peered behind that facade through reports, interviews and chance encounters, accompanied by ‘endless toasts to greater understanding’. Fresh from a seven-encore recital, the Bolshoi’s star bass Yevgeni Nesterenko held court in his riverfront pad, offering vodka, snacks and anecdotes. A trip accompanying a local reporter to a bread plant that had exceeded its target production quota expanded into an exploration of the workings and editorial policy of the Moscow press. Shortages were almost a character in their own right: ‘The word niet soon becomes depressingly familiar.’ On the streets, ‘the average housewife queues for two hours a day,’ reportedly, while in the journalists’ hotel ‘we survived to some extent on bread and whisky’. No telephone directory – paper shortages – seemed particularly shocking and cars had no windscreen wipers: ‘Prudent drivers keep them in the glove compartment so they don’t get pinched.’ Despite that, there’s a thoughtful appreciation of the city’s beauty and strangeness and of the hospitality and resilience of its inhabitants. The last Soviet citizens the Observer met were tourists, competition winners from Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, admiring ‘the greatness of our country’. If that name seems familiar, the city is home to one of the nuclear power plants Putin shelled with such menace in late November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-retreat-in-bakhmut-highlights-shortage-of-credible-combat-units-say-uk-officials","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-13T17:31:07Z","webTitle":"Two Russian jets and two helicopters reportedly shot down – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-retreat-in-bakhmut-highlights-shortage-of-credible-combat-units-say-uk-officials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-retreat-in-bakhmut-highlights-shortage-of-credible-combat-units-say-uk-officials","fields":{"headline":"Two Russian jets and two helicopters reportedly shot down – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining northeast Ukraine. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed and ten people were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers, it added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy held talks in Italy with the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. The trip is Zelenskiy’s first to Italy since Russia invaded on 24 February last year. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. The brigade had been “dogged with allegations of poor morale and limited combat effectiveness”. Zelenskiy will be received in Berlin on Sunday, German government sources told Reuters on Saturday, as the leader seeks to shore up support from key allies against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian leader last visited Germany for the Munich security council in February last year just before the war broke out. The German government will provide further military equipment worth €2.7bn (£2.4bn) to Ukraine in what would be the biggest Berlin has provided since Russia’s invasion. The package includes 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, 30 Leopard 1 tanks, 15 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 200 reconnaissance drones, four additional Iris-T anti-aircraft systems including ammunition, additional artillery ammunition and more than 200 armoured combat and logistics vehicles, according to Der Spiegel. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a local factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. A Russian SU-34 warplane crashed in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, Tass news agency reported, quoting emergency services, in the second such incident on Saturday after a helicopter was seemingly downed in the same region. Two Russian pilots were killed when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. It said it believed the reason for Friday’s crash was equipment failure, Tass reported. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, the defence ministry said on Saturday on Twitter. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force told Reuters a search for the object was under way. Russian and Belarusian authorities were not immediately available for comment. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday two industrial sites in the occupied city of Luhansk have been struck with Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles supplied by Britain. Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier confirmed it would send the Storm Shadow missiles, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. South Africa’s foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Reuben Brigety said on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a Russian vessel, which is under sanctions, at the Simon’s Town naval base near Cape Town in December last year and that the arms were then transported to Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than 1,000 troops and up to 40 tanks were used in Thursday’s assault, it said on Friday, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest. Rishi Sunak expressed disappointment at a decision to block Zelenskiy’s request to speak via video at Saturday’s Eurovision grand final. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the event, said the Ukrainian president had “laudable” intentions but rejected the request over fears it could politicise the event. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed and 10 people were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers, it added. Ukrainian troops are advancing in two directions in the eastern city of Bakhmut but the situation in the city centre is more complicated, deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said. “The enemy is not able to take control of the city,” Malyar wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining northeast Ukraine. “According to preliminary data ... the fighters were supposed to deliver a missile and bomb attack on targets in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine, and the helicopters were there to back them up – among other things to pick up the ‘Su’ crews if they were shot down.” The Russian state news agency Tass said a Russian Su-34 warplane had crashed in that region but did not specify a cause. Tass also cited an emergency services official as saying an engine fire in a helicopter had caused it to crash near Klintsy, which is about 40 km (25 miles) from the border. It made no mention of the Su-35 or of a second helicopter. President Zelensky has tweeted details of his meeting today with the Pope at the Vatican. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military co-operation in Asia and believes the two countries are “strengthening” their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started, Sky News reports. Russia’s invasion has “shaken the very foundation of the international order” and Vladimir Putin must face a united response from the worldwide community, he told international ministers in Sweden. “In addition, China and Russia are strengthening their military collaboration, including joint flights of their bombers and joint naval exercises in the vicinity of Japan,” Hayahshi said. A ballad about ethnic cleansing was an unusual choice for Eurovision, a competition best known for glam, kitschy pop. But seven years ago Crimean Tatar singer Jamala swept Ukraine to its second victory in the song contest with 1944. It told the story of the deportation of her entire people – hundreds of thousands of women, children and men – from their ancestral home to central Asia on Stalin’s orders. The Tatars’ exile lasted decades, and when they were finally allowed to return, their centuries-long history had been all but erased. Russians had moved into their homes, and the peninsula’s geography had been rewritten, with towns and villages all given new Russian names. Music is particularly important to Crimean Tatars because the brutality of the deportations means an entire people have been left with very few physical heirlooms. Families were given just 15 minutes to pack for their long journey crammed into cattle wagons, could take only what they could carry and ended up selling almost everything of value to survive in exile. The head of Russia’s federal crime agency suggested that key sectors of the economy should be returned to state ownership to support Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Moscow has already seized assets or acquired them at a heavy discount from some western firms that have quit Russia or scaled back their activities since the invasion, Reuters reports. “We are essentially talking about economic security in a war,” Alexander Bastrykin, head of the investigative committee, told a conference that was streamed online. “Let’s go along the path of nationalising the main sectors of our economy.” Ukraine has regained at least a kilometre of territory in the eastern city of Bakhmut amid an alleged Russian withdrawal from the area, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy flew to Rome to meet Pope Francis for the first time since Russia’s invasion, writes Lorenzo Tondo and Luke Harding. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said that over the past four days, Russian troops from the 72nd separate motor rifle brigade (72 SMRB) had possibly withdrawn “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the Bakhmut operation. The move, according to British intelligence, reflected Moscow’s lack of effective combat units. In its latest intelligence briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD wrote: “72 SMRB is an element of Russia’s 3rd Army Corps, a formation created in autumn 2023 [sic] and dogged with allegations of poor morale and limited combat effectiveness”. It’s approaching 6pm in Ukraine, here’s a look at the latest news. Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrived in Italy on Saturday for talks with the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. The trip is Zelenskiy’s first to Italy since Russia invaded on 24 February last year. Meloni, has promised Italy’s full support to Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia’s “brutal and unjust aggression.” Speaking alongside Zelenskiy on Saturday, Meloni said Italy would continue to supply Ukraine with weapons and back his country for as long as is necessary. “We are betting on Ukraine’s victory,” Meloni said.

Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has met Pope Francis at the Vatican, who said in late April the Holy See is involved in a peace mission to end the war with Russia. Earlier the president met his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, and then prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, before he was due to head to the Vatican. Both Mattarella and Meloni reiterated Italy’s full support for Ukraine in terms of military, financial, humanitarian and reconstruction aid in the short and long term. At a news conference after her meeting with Zelenskiy, Meloni condemned Russia’s “brutal and unjust aggression,” pledged Italy’s support for Ukraine for “as long as is necessary,” and urged Russia to immediately withdraw. “You can’t achieve peace through a surrender,” she said, echoing a previous comment by Mattarella. “It would be a very grave precedent for all nations of the world.” She emphasised Italy’s support for Ukraine’s membership of the European Union and the “intensification” of a partnership with Nato. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived at the Vatican for a private audience with Pope Francis. Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding reporting from Kyiv. There are unconfirmed reports that another plane and helicopter has crashed, in what appears to be a disastrous day for Russian aviation. Moscow Telegram channels reported that an SU-35 warplane had been shot down too, together with a second Mi8 helicopter. Another military helicopter crashed on Friday in Crimea. It was unclear whether the two aircraft and two helicopters were downed on Saturday because of friendly fire, or if the Ukrainians targeted them with missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be received in Berlin on Sunday, German government sources told Reuters on Saturday, as the leader seeks to shore up support from key allies against Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy will arrive from Italy where he was meeting with Italian officials and Pope Francis on Saturday. The Ukrainian leader last visited Germany for the Munich security council in February last year just before the war broke out. Germany on Saturday announced €2.7 bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package yet since the Russian invasion, and pledged further support for Kyiv for as long as necessary. The country has also taken in around a million Ukrainian refugees. Christian Mölling, deputy director at the German council on foreign relations said Zelenskiy will probably want to know directly from Chancellor Olaf Scholz how he sees the war ending. Mölling said: Does Germany want a Ukrainian victory or is it enough for the war to end? It will be important for Zelenskiy to hear directly from the chancellor how he thinks … Ukraine needs financial assistance to pay its debt so it doesn’t go bankrupt and Germany plays a big role there. He added: “And Ukraine is seeing that in Germany other topics are beginning to move into the foreground.” Prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has promised Italy’s full support to Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia’s “brutal and unjust aggression.” Speaking alongside Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, Meloni said Italy would continue to supply Ukraine with weapons and back his country for as long as is necessary. “We are betting on Ukraine’s victory,” Meloni said. Earlier in the day Zelenskiy met Italy’s head of state, Sergio Mattarella, in the president’s Quirinale palace and he will shortly head to the Vatican for talks with Pope Francis.

Russia’s defence ministry says two industrial sites in the occupied city of Luhansk have been struck with Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles supplied by Britain. On Thursday, the UK became the first country to say it had started supplying Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, which will allow it to hit Russian troops and supply dumps far behind the frontlines as Ukraine prepares a major counteroffensive. On Saturday, Russia said: Storm Shadow air-to-air missiles supplied to the Kyiv regime by Britain were used for the strike. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the missiles could be used within Ukrainian territory, implying that he had received assurances from Kyiv that they would not be used to attack targets inside Russia’s internationally accepted borders. The Russian ministry said the missiles had hit a plant producing polymers and a meat-processing factory. Ukraine has regained at least a kilometre of territory in the eastern city of Bakhmut amid an alleged Russian withdrawal from the area. Over the past four days, Russian troops from the 72nd separate motor rifle brigade (72 SMRB) possibly withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the Bakhmut operation, said the UK’s Ministry of Defence. The move, according to the British intelligence, reflected Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”. “72 SMRB is an element of Russia’s 3rd Army Corps, a formation created in autumn 2023 [sic] and dogged with allegations of poor morale and limited combat effectiveness,” the UK MoD said in its latest intelligence briefing posted on Twitter. “Its deployment to such a demanding and operationally important sector highlights Russia’s severe shortage of credible combat units.” The statement came a day after Russia’s first admission that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut. Moscow’s defence ministry said on Friday that some of its troops had fallen back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the city, which the Kremlin has been trying to take for more than 10 months. There has been intense speculation that Ukraine is about to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive, with several Russian military bloggers claiming on Thursday that the counterattack had already started and that Kyiv had already broken through parts of the frontline. Military analysts have suggested Ukraine’s localised offensive in Bakhmut appears to indicate it is trying to pin down Russian forces in the city. But Ukrainian officials on Friday played down these reports. More photos are emerging from Zelenskiy’s Rome visit where he met Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, at the Quirinale presidential palace, and prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at Palazzo Chigi. The visit is his first to Italy since Russia invaded in February last year. Meloni visited Zelenskiy in Kyiv in February to assure him of Italy’s continued support for Ukraine, despite some of her allies, most notably former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, having longstanding, close ties with Moscow. Later, the Ukrainian president will meet Pope Francis. The meeting is expected to be the most significant part of Zelenskiy’s time in Italy. He previously met the pope at the Vatican in 2020 and the two have had several phone conversations since the war began. Zelenskiy is also expected to be the guest on a popular Italian television talkshow before heading to Germany. A Russian SU-34 warplane crashed in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, Tass news agency reported, quoting emergency services, in the second such incident on Saturday after a helicopter was seemingly downed in the same region. A painting by Banksy has been dismounted from a heavily damaged building in Irpin, west of Kyiv according to Sky News. Banksy, whose work can sell for millions, had painted six others last year in places affected by heavy fighting after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Italy is fully supporting Ukraine in its resistance against Russia’s invasion, the Italian head of state said in welcoming Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to his residence in Rome on Saturday. “It is an honour to have you here in Rome,” president Sergio Mattarella told Zelenskiy, in remarks aired on Italian television. “I asked to meet you again after our conversation of years ago, although in this different condition, we are fully at your side,” Mattarella said. Zelenskiy has arrived in Italy on Saturday for talks with prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. The trip is Zelenskiy’s first to Italy since Russia invaded on 24 February last year. He held talks with president, Sergio Mattarella, at the Quirinale Palace and is due to have a working lunch with prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, before heading to the Vatican. As he headed to the presidential palace, Zeleniskiy’s motorcade passed by small groups holding Ukrainian flags, with one person holding up a sign condemning Russia. Meloni visited Zelenskiy in Kyiv in February to assure him of Italy’s continued support for Ukraine, despite some of her allies, most notably former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, having longstanding, close ties with Moscow. The meeting with the pope is expected to be the most significant part of Zelenskiy’s time in Italy. He previously met the pope at the Vatican in 2020 and the two have had several phone conversations since the war began. A helicopter crashed in Russia’s Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, Tass news agency has said, citing emergency services on Saturday. Tass quoted an official as saying preliminary information indicated the helicopter’s engine had caught fire before the crash. As a Ukrainian musician and a combat paramedic, the UK’s Eurovision efforts have lifted my heart Life before war broke out in my home country of Ukraine feels like a distant memory. Before, I was frontman of the band Antytila. I lived with my wife and three children in Kyiv. With my bandmates, we had plans to make new music and tour, playing stadiums across the country. But after February 2022, our only thoughts were to serve; to resist. Life changed radically overnight for all of us. My bandmates Serhii Vusyk, Dmytro Zholud and I swapped our instruments for rifles and joined the frontline. We became paramedics with the 130th battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defence forces, giving first aid to our injured brothers and saving lives. It was too dangerous for our families to stay in Kyiv, so our wives and children moved first to western Ukraine before settling abroad. My wife and three children landed in New Jersey, US, where they have remained with my mother and stepfather. My wife, musician Alyosha, wrote last year of how she kept her bags packed by the door, desperate to return home at the first sign of safety. Our separation was made all the more dramatic by the very real threat I was facing each day: would I leave the frontline alive?

Nato-member Poland is on alert for infractions of its airspace as war rages in neighbouring Ukraine after incidents in November and December in which missiles landed on its territory. “The Air Operations Center noted the appearance in Polish airspace of an object that flew in from the direction of Belarus,” the defence ministry said on Twitter. “It is probably an observation balloon,” it added. “Radar contact was lost near Rypin”, a town in north-central Poland. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force told Reuters a search for the object was under way. Russian and Belarusian authorities were not immediately available for comment. Hello and welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine, now in its 444th day. It’s approaching noon in Ukraine, here’s a look at the latest. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. The brigade had been “dogged with allegations of poor morale and limited combat effectiveness”. In other developments: Zelenskiy arrived in Italy on Saturday for talks with prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. The trip is Zelenskiy’s first to Italy since Russia invaded on 24 February last year. The German government will provide further military equipment worth €2.7bn (£2.4bn) to Ukraine in what would be the biggest Berlin has provided since Russia’s invasion. The package includes 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, 30 Leopard 1 tanks, 15 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 200 reconnaissance drones, four additional Iris-T anti-aircraft systems including ammunition, additional artillery ammunition and more than 200 armoured combat and logistics vehicles, according to Der Spiegel. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a local factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. Two Russian pilots were killed when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. It said it believed the reason for Friday’s crash was equipment failure, Tass reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier confirmed it would send the Storm Shadow missiles, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. South Africa’s foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Reuben Brigety said on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a Russian vessel, which is under sanctions, at the Simon’s Town naval base near Cape Town in December last year and that the arms were then transported to Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than 1,000 troops and up to 40 tanks were used in Thursday’s assault, it said on Friday, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, has expressed disappointment at a decision to block Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to speak via video at Saturday’s Eurovision grand final. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the event, said the Ukrainian president had “laudable” intentions but rejected the request over fears it could politicise the event. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived at Rome’s Ciampino airport on Saturday, a political source told Reuters. Confirming the visit on Twitter, the Ukrainian president said it was important for “approaching victory of Ukraine”. During his stay in Rome, he will meet the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the president, Sergio Mattarella, and Pope Francis. The pontiff said in late April that the Holy See was involved in a peace mission to end the war in Ukraine. Ukraine aims for repeat victory in most political Eurovision in years There will be rockets, soldiers and moustachioed men in their underpants lampooning Vladimir Putin as a “crocodile psychopath” – and that’s just the Croatian act. One of the most stridently political Eurovision grand finals in years takes place in Liverpool on Saturday night against a backdrop of a war in Ukraine that shows little sign of ending. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to make a live address during the four-hour broadcast was denied as organisers were concerned it risked politicising the contest. There will be little subtlety, however, in the 67th edition of this ritually outre event.

Unfortunately, this is not yet foreseeable. Therefore, Germany will provide any help it can – as long as it takes,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Saturday. “Thank you to our allies,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote in a post on Telegram confirming the package. Zelenskiy is expected in Italy on Saturday for talks with government officials and Pope Francis, who in late April said that the Holy See is involved in a peace mission to end the war with Russia. The trip, Zelenskiy’s first to Italy since Russia invaded on 24 February last year, has not been officially confirmed for security reasons, Reuters reports. But sources expect him to meet separately with President Sergio Mattarella and the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, before heading to the Vatican. He is also expected to be the guest of a popular Italian television talk show before heading to Germany. Meloni visited Zelenskiy in Kyiv in February to assure him of Italy’s continued support for Ukraine, despite some of her allies, most notably the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, having longstanding, close ties with Moscow. Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Ukraine: South Africans were left angry and baffled after the US accused their country of secretly shipping arms to Russia, a charge that triggered both a government rebuke and the announcement of an inquiry, Agence France-Presse reports. The US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, said on Thursday that Washington was confident weapons and ammunition had been loaded on a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base. The explosive remarks drew an angry response from President Cyril Ramaphosa, who did not deny the charge but said a retired judge would lead an investigation into it. They were also seized on by the Kremlin, which on Friday said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had agreed to deepen ties with Ramaphosa. South Africa has been walking a diplomatic tightrope over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which it has refused to condemn, saying it prefers dialogue to end the war. The country has strong economic and trade relations with the United States and Europe. Trade with Russia is much smaller, but Pretoria has ties with Moscow dating back decades, to when the Kremlin supported the now ruling African National Congress party in its struggle against apartheid. The announcement of an inquiry was welcomed by the US but met with ridicule and bewilderment at home. The political and economic analyst Daniel Silke said: It perhaps points to a South African president who simply is unaware of what is happening effectively under his nose. The Lady R, a cargo vessel under western sanctions flying a Russian flag, docked at South Africa’s largest naval base in December, officially to offload an old order of ammunition. But Brigety said intelligence showed weaponry was loaded on to the vessel before it headed back to Russia. Bongani Bingwa, the host of a popular morning radio show, wrote on Twitter: Did we or didn’t we? And if we did, shouldn’t the president know? Russian claims of Ukrainian missile strikes on the Luhansk region’s main city have prompted speculation among analysts that Kyiv could have used a new missile with a longer range because the city lies far from Ukrainian positions. Reuters reports that Moscow-installed officials said on Friday that the missiles had injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. Leonid Pasechnik, the Russian-installed head of the region, which Russia annexed last year, said the attack was carried out to disrupt local Republic Day celebrations. The claimed strikes were unable to be verified and there was no immediate official reaction from Kyiv to them. Ukraine’s Suspilne Donbas television station reported explosions in the city, quoting residents. Luhansk is about 30km (18 miles) from the border with Russia and 100km from the frontlines of fighting, putting it beyond the reach of most of the shorter-range missiles, such as the US-supplied Himars that Ukraine has largely been using in the conflict. The UK said this week it had delivered to Ukraine longer-range cruise missiles that could hit targets at 300km – the furthest rockets supplied to Kyiv by its western allies. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor has said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a local factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. In Kyiv, the capital, air raid sirens sounded overnight, the Kyiv Independent reported. Strikes were also reported in Lviv, western Ukraine, with the regional military administration saying kamikaze drones were involved. Sienkevych said rescuers were working at the scene in Mykolaiv. One of the injured was taken away by ambulance while two received medical assistance on site. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects its “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the latest UK intelligence briefing has said. The Ministry of Defence said that over the past four days, elements of Russia’s 72nd separate motor rifle brigade (72 SMRB) likely withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the Bakhmut operation. The area was tactically significant because it was a Russian bridgehead on the western side of the Donets-Donbas canal, which marked the frontline through parts of the area, the ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter. 72 SMRB is an element of Russia’s 3rd Army Corps, a formation created in autumn 2023 [sic] and dogged with allegations of poor morale and limited combat effectiveness. Its deployment to such a demanding and operationally important sector highlights Russia’s severe shortage of credible combat units.

In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs. “They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,” Kadyrov said in an audio message posted to his Telegram channel on Sunday. “If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say,” said Kadyrov, a former rebel turned Kremlin ally who rules Chechnya – a Russian republic in the Caucasus – with an iron fist and has a paramilitary force at his command. Since the invasion in February, the Kremlin has focused on silencing liberal voices critical of the war, but as things go sour on the battlefield, Putin faces a headache with what to do with former cheerleaders who want Russia to commit more forces to the war to turn the tide. Many units from Chechnya have taken part in Russia’s war effort, and while Kadyrov is ostensibly hyper-loyal to Moscow, he is one of the few Russian political figures whose messaging the Kremlin does not fully control. All eyes will be on how Putin responds to the retreat. He has previously glossed over claims that he made a terrible miscalculation in February when he thought the Russian army could overrun Ukraine in a matter of days. In a recent appearance he said Russia had “lost nothing” during the war, but the major losses of recent days could be a harder sell to the Russian population. On Saturday, as the disastrous news from the front trickled through, Putin was busy opening a huge observation wheel in a Moscow park as part of celebrations for Moscow Day. Military bloggers sharply criticised him for going ahead with the celebrations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-no-quick-wins-in-kherson-zelenskiy-adviser-says-nuclear-inspectors-due-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: UN to maintain ‘continued presence’ at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant amid reports of shelling nearby – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-no-quick-wins-in-kherson-zelenskiy-adviser-says-nuclear-inspectors-due-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-no-quick-wins-in-kherson-zelenskiy-adviser-says-nuclear-inspectors-due-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: UN to maintain ‘continued presence’ at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant amid reports of shelling nearby – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Rafael Grossi, the chief international nuclear inspector, has said he saw “the key things I needed to see” and his team was able to gather “a lot of information” during a long-awaited visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine. “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here – let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,” Grossi said in a video from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said Grossi had left the site after a visit that was delayed by several hours because of shelling. Five International Atomic Energy Agency representatives would remain, probably until Saturday. Grossi said his team would be staying on and maintain a “continued presence” at the plant. Grossi’s comments came after both sides accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA visit, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame for shelling. Enerhodar, the city beside the plant, came under fire at dawn, its mayor said, and Russian forces reportedly shelled the pre-agreed route the inspectors were meant to take. Moscow claimed to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to capture the plant. The Red Cross has issued an urgent call for an end to all military operations around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning the consequences of a strike could be “catastrophic”. It was “high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures” to protect the plant from any military operations, director general of the ICRC, Robert Mardini, said. The stakes were “immense”, he added. Ukrainian authorities are making “all efforts” to switch the fifth reactor of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back on after it shut down due to shelling earlier today, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company said. The long-awaited visit by IAEA inspectors to the plant would be successful if it led to the “demilitarisation” of the facility, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, said. Boris Johnson has said the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is Ukrainian and the Ukrainians should “have it back in their control”. The PM said it was Russia’s “explicit” objective to unplug the nuclear plant from the Ukrainian grid and plug it into the Russian grid. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers are “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, HRW said. Away from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Thursday marked the start of the school year in Ukraine. The Guardian spoke with teachers at School No 2 in Borodianka, where in-person classes remain online after it was trashed by occupying Russian forces in March. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has warned Moldova that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops (in Transnistria) would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia,” Lavrov warned. Vladimir Putin will not attend the funeral of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on Saturday because of schedule constraints, the Kremlin has said. Putin was pictured visiting Gorbachev’s open coffin earlier today, where he laid flowers at Moscow’s central clinical hospital. The chairman of Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil, Ravil Maganov, has died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow, according to reports. Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Lukoil was one of the few major Russian companies to call for an end to the Ukraine war. According to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Maganov had taken his own life. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. The German government rejects the claim, calling it a “pretence”. It said Nord Stream was “fully operational” and that there were no technical issues. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, said Gazprom, the Russian state energy company. A British man has died while volunteering as a medic in Ukraine, his family has said. Craig Mackintosh, from Thetford in Norfolk, died “in the line of duty” on 24 August, his sister Lorna Mackintosh said. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s more from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, who said nuclear experts would maintain a continued presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant following his visit today. Grossi, who visited the plant for several hours, admitted to reporters he would continue to worry until the situation at Zaporizhzhia had stabilised. He said: We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving - it’s going to stay there. The UN nuclear watchdog will have “a continued presence” at the nuclear plant with some of his experts who would provide an impartial neutral technically sound assessment of what was happening on the ground, he said. Grossi added: I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has said his team of nuclear inspectors have completed their first tour of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. In a video published on his Twitter feed, Grossi said: We are finishing our long-awaited visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. I have just completed a first tour of the key areas that we wanted to see in this first approach to the whole facility. There is “a lot more to do”, Grossi said, adding that his team would be staying on. He added: Most importantly, we are establishing a continued presence from the IAEA. Ukrainian authorities are making “all efforts” to switch the fifth reactor of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back on after it shut down due to shelling earlier today, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company said. The long-awaited visit by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to the Russian-occupied nuclear plant in south-eastern Ukraine would be successful if it led to the “demilitarisation” of the facility, Petro Kotin, the head of the Ukrainian state energy company Energoatom, said in an interview with Reuters. Ukraine’s top priority was to demilitarise the plant and the surrounding area in order to avoid a nuclear accident, he said. Kotin said: If this mission helps to do that, then it will be successful. He said the fact that the IAEA mission had been able to visit the nuclear plant after months of negotiation marked progress, but accused Russia of trying to propagandise the visit by excluding independent journalists. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Ukrainian civilians, including those fleeing hostilities, are being “left with no choice but to go to Russia”, the rights organisation warned in a report. The report documents the transfers of Ukrainian civilians, many of whom were fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Others were from the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine. One woman transferred from Mariupol told the organisation: Of course, we would have used the opportunity to go to Ukraine if we could have. But we had no choice, no possibility to go. Forced transfers are “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, HRW said. It added: Russian and Russian-affiliated authorities also subjected thousands of Ukrainian citizens to a form of compulsory, punitive, and abusive security screening called “filtration”. Another civilian from Mariupol said that, after being detained by Russian troops, he and dozens of others were held “like hostages” in a village schoolhouse for two weeks under filthy conditions before undergoing filtration. Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, has confirmed that the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has left the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Five IAEA representatives will remain at the site of the plant, probably until 3 September, the company added. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he was able to look at the “key things” he needed to see while visiting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant today, Russian media have reported. The UN nuclear agency’s mission was able to gather “a lot” of information in a few hours, Grossi told reporters in a video released by the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. Grossi said: We were able, in these few hours, to gather a lot, a lot of information. The key things I needed to see, I saw. Grossi left the plant following the visit, the news agency reported. Some members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team have left the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after spending several hours at the site, Reuters reports. Four of the nine vehicles from the mission have left the nuclear plant’s territory, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: UN inspectors have arrived at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine. The plant’s operator, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, confirmed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission was on site. A Ukrainian source said the mission could be “shorter than planned”. The IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was delayed for several hours by reports of shelling around Europe’s biggest atomic facility. Enerhodar, the city beside the plant, came under fire early on Thursday, its mayor said, and Russian forces reportedly shelled the pre-agreed route the inspectors were meant to take. Moscow claimed to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to capture the plant. Ukraine cannot guarantee security for the team of UN inspectors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the country’s energy minister Herman Halushchenko has said. The situation around the Russian-held nuclear power plant remains “a mess”, Halushchenko said, adding that he told the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, that security is “your own responsibility”. The Red Cross has issued an urgent call for an end to all military operations around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning the consequences of a strike could be “catastrophic”.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president has said. Oleksiy Arestovych added that Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has warned Moldova that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops (in Transnistria) would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia,” Lavrov warned.

Finland has announced that it will provide €8.3m (£7.16m) in further defence aid to Ukraine. The announcement by Finland’s defence minister, Antti Kaikkonen, takes the total donations to Ukraine from Finland to €92.3m.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Across the river from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lies the city of Nikopol, which is being pounded regularly with Russian rocket fire. Each night residents go to sleep not knowing if they will wake up. World leaders have expressed increasing alarm at Europe’s largest nuclear plant becoming a war zone. Any radiation leak could be catastrophic for Ukraine and the wider continent. Kyiv says Russian forces are using the plant as a shield, hiding military equipment there knowing they cannot be targeted. Moscow claims Ukraine is shelling the plant and its surroundings. The Guardian’s Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry visited Nikopol to speak to residents the morning after an attack: Ukraine cannot grant security for the team of UN inspectors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the country’s energy minister Herman Halushchenko said. The situation around the Russian-held nuclear power plant remains “a mess”, CNN cites Halushchenko as saying in Novooleksandrivka in the Zaporizhzhia region, where he accompanied the IAEA delegation before they travelled on to the Russian-occupied territory. Halushchenko said he told the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, that security is “your own responsibility”. Grossi seemed “confident to assume the risk,” he added. He also said: Ukraine fulfilled all international obligations and gave every possibility for this mission to come. The Ukrainian minister said he understood the IAEA mission has “some security agreement with the Russians” and suggested several members of the team would stay onsite “for several days”. Grossi is due to arrive back in Novooleksandrivka today, he added. Isobel Koshiw reports for the Guardian from Borodianka: The children and teachers gathered on the grass outside School Number 2 in Borodianka on Thursday morning for the first day of the academic year. There were speeches and a recital of the Ukrainian national anthem, and as is traditional the girls wore white scrunchies in their hair, the boys white shirts. They brought flowers to give to their teachers. But there will be no lessons in the classrooms of School Number 2 this year. Borodianka, a town just north of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian forces in March. The invading soldiers used the school as a base, before trashing it as they left. The teachers described returning to the school after it was liberated and finding the soldiers had used several classrooms as toilets, left rubbish everywhere and needlessly destroyed whiteboards, PE equipment, TVs and computers. They also graffitied anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian slogans on the walls and dug trenches behind the school. The speeches on Thursday morning stuck to familiar themes of defiance against the odds and freeing Ukraine of the “enemy”. They ended with a minute’s silence for those who have died defending the country. After the ceremony, the teachers and students returned home to start their lessons on their smartphones and laptops. Only year 1 will be learning in person, joining another first-year class at the only school in the town left undamaged.

Reuters reports that Finland’s defence minister, Antti Kaikkonen,said in a statement “Ukraine’s defensive fight continues, the need for aid remains high”. It takes total donations to Ukraine from Finland to €92.3m. The Finnish defence ministry gave no description of the materiel or timeline for its delivery for security reasons. Here are some images showing UN inspectors arriving at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission was delayed for several hours by reports of shelling around Europe’s biggest atomic facility that led to one of its two working reactors being shut down. Vladimir Putin visited the open coffin of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, earlier today. The Russian president laid flowers at Moscow’s central clinical hospital, where Gorbachev died earlier this week aged 91. The Kremlin said Putin would not attend Gorbachev’s funeral this weekend because of schedule constraints. Boris Johnson has said the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is Ukrainian and the Ukrainians should “have it back in their control”. The British prime minister was asked about the risks of the Zaporizhzhia plant after delivering a speech in Sizewell in Suffolk. Johnson said: It’s clearly the objective of the Russians about which they are absolutely ... explicit ... they want to unplug it from the Ukrainian grid and plug it into the Russian grid. And there are much greater nuclear experts than me in this room … I’m told that that has all sorts of risks, doing something like that. We don’t want to take any risk with Zaporizhzhia. He added: I think it’s important that Mr Grossi and the IAEA are allowed to get into it and do their inspection. But I’ve got to tell you I think that Zaporizhzhia is a Ukrainian plant and the Ukrainians should have it back in their control. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has warned Moldova that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Russia has stationed peacekeeping troops in Transnistria since the early 1990s, when an armed conflict saw pro-Russian separatists wrest most of the region from Moldovan control. Russian forces also guard a large ammunition dump in the region. Russia has said its army is there to maintain peace and stability, but Moldova wants Moscow to withdraw its forces. In April, tensions in Moldova soared after a series of sporadic attacks were reported in Transnistria. In an address at Russia’s top foreign affairs school, Lavrov said: Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops (in Transnistria) would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia. Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom has confirmed that the IAEA mission has arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Euromaidan Press has a video reportedly showing the UN team arriving at the plant: The IAEA’s mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant may turn out to be “shorter than planned”, according to reports. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, had previously said the planned visit was expected to last “a few days” and that the agency planned to establish a permanent presence at the plant. But on Tuesday, the head of the Russian-installed local administration said the visit was designed to take just one day. Yevgeny Balitsky, who on Monday said he did not expect much from the IAEA visit, told the agency the inspectors “must see the work of the station in one day”. UN inspectors have arrived at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, Reuters reports. The team from the International Atomic Energy Agency were seen arriving at the plant in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby. The delegation had been delayed after reports of fighting earlier today around Europe’s biggest nuclear plant. The Red Cross has issued an urgent call for an end to all military operations around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning the consequences of a strike could be “catastrophic”. It was “high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures” to protect the Russian-held nuclear plant from any military operations, director general of the ICRC, Robert Mardini, told reporters in Kyiv. The stakes were “immense”, Mardini said. He added: The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation that we will regret for decades. He also said: When hazardous sites become battlegrounds, the consequences for millions of people and the environment can be catastrophic and last many years. In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to provide humanitarian assistance. The Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has accused Russia of seeking to “wreck” the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspection visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia was acting like a “terrorist state” by shelling the territory of the plant as well as Energodar, the town which neighbours the plant, Yermak claimed on Twitter. He added: It is Russia that is responsible for everything happening at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and in Energodar. Russia has accused Ukraine of attempting to seize the nuclear plant, after it said up to 60 Ukrainian soldiers crossed the frontline Dnieper River in boats early today. It has not been possible to verify the reports of either side. The chairman of Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil, Ravil Maganov, has died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow, according to reports. The company confirmed his death but said Maganov, 67, had died following a “serious illness”. Several Russian outlets reported that he died after falling out of a window of a Moscow hospital. According to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Maganov had taken his own life. Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months, after the billionaire Alexander Subbotin was found dead in a shaman’s home in Mytishchi in May. Lukoil was one of the few major Russian companies to call for an end to the Ukraine war. In March, it released a statement calling for a “fast resolution” to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and expressing its “sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy”. Vladimir Putin will not attend the funeral of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on Saturday because of schedule constraints, the Kremlin has said. In his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had paid his respects on Thursday morning by visiting Moscow’s Central clinical hospital, where Gorbachev died aged 91 on Tuesday. Peskov said: Unfortunately, the president’s work schedule will not allow him to do this on 3 September, so he decided to do it today. Russian news agencies reported yesterday that Gorbachev’s funeral will take place on Saturday in Moscow’s Hall of Columns, the same place where Josef Stalin’s body was put on display following his death in 1953. Sources told the Interfax news agency there were no plans to organise a state funeral for the former Soviet president. Speaking with reporters today, Peskov said Gorbachev’s funeral would have “elements” of a state funeral, including a guard of honour, and that the state was helping with the organisation. On Wednesday afternoon, the Kremlin broke its silence over Gorbachev’s death with an official statement from Putin who described him as “a politician and statesman who had a huge impact on the course of global history”. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team seeking to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) occupied by Russian forces in southern Ukraine has said that it is determined to reach the plant today, despite being held up at a checkpoint amid reports of increased military activity in the vicinity of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. Reports say the UN convey is being held some 20km from the frontline. The IAEA inspectors are being led personally by the director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who told the media earlier: “There has been increased military activity including this morning, until very recently, a few minutes ago … but weighing the pros and cons and having come so far, we are not stopping.” Early today, the ZNPP operator Energoatom said that “due to another mortar shelling by the Russian occupying forces … the emergency protection was activated and the operating power unit five was shut down.” The city mayor of Energodar, where the plant is located, posted images to Telegram purporting to show damage to buildings. Dmytro Orlov, said “several civilian objects were hit”. For their part, Russian’s ministry of defence has claimed that earlier today it repulsed an attempt by Ukrainian forces to sabotage or retake the ZNPP. It said a small number of Ukrainian troops had launched two amphibious attacks. It also alleged that Ukrainian fire had come within 400 metres of the ZNPP. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said at an event in Moscow: “We are doing everything to ensure that this station is safe, that it functions safely. And for the mission there to carry out all its plans.” The adviser to Ukraine’s president, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Russia’s actions today around the ZNPP demonstrate “the true weight of Russian ‘guarantees’ for any intermediaries”. The IAEA mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is waiting at a Ukrainian checkpoint after fresh shelling around the plant on Thursday, but remains determined to reach the plant today, a spokesperson has told Reuters. Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom confirmed that the IAEA convoy is at a Ukrainian checkpoint about 20km (12.4 miles) from the frontline, and is waiting for the situation near the plant to become safer. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are on their way to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, despite reports of shelling in the area. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said the mission understood the high risk from the “increased military activity” between Ukrainian and Russian defence lines but was going ahead with its plans to visit the plant. Here is a video clip of their departure. The Russian ministry of defence has said the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which it occupies, is “difficult, but remains under full control”. In a statement posted to Telegram it said: Despite the attempts of the Kyiv regime to disrupt the arrival of a group of IAEA experts at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Russian side confirms its readiness to accept them with full safety for further work. The situation in the area of the nuclear power plant is difficult, but remains under full control. Russia has alleged this morning that Ukrainian forces attempted to launch an amphibious mission to sabotage or recapture the power plant. The attack, as described by Russian sources, would have involved a significant crossing of the Dnieper River, which Roland Oliphant, foreign correspondent at the Telegraph, has assessed as “bold/suicidal”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said this morning that Russia was doing everything to ensure that Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant could operate safely, and for visiting inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to be able to complete their tasks. Speaking at an event to celebrate the opening of the school year in Moscow, Lavrov said: “We are doing everything to ensure that this station is safe, that it functions safely. And for the mission there to carry out all its plans.” Russian forces have occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Away from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for a moment, 1 September marks the start of the school year in Ukraine. Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of Kyiv, has posted to Telegram to say: This year it is unusual for all of us – without traditional lines, without a large crowd of schoolchildren. There is a full-scale war in the country and this is our new reality. The first thing we think about is the safety of our young citizens. Despite everything, we are starting the school year. Educational institutions of the region will work in face-to-face, mixed and distance formats. Mykhailo Podolyak, who is an adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that the actions today around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant demonstrate “the true weight of Russian ‘guarantees’ for any intermediaries”. He has tweeted: Russia carries out demonstrative strikes on Energodar, hitting the official route of the IAEA mission. To blame it on Ukraine. Houses were destroyed. This is a demonstration of the real ‘interest’ of the Russian Federation in the inspection. And this is another proof of the true weight of Russian ‘guarantees’ for any intermediaries. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has issued its daily operation briefing, in which it claims to have killed 450 members of the pro-Russian forces occupying Ukraine in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of claimed casualties to “about 48,350”. The statement also says that “[the] Russian enemy suffered the greatest losses (of the past day) at the Donetsk and Kurakhove directions.” The claims have not been independently verified. The Interfax-Ukraine news agency is reporting that the IAEA inspectors are at a checkpoint in Novooleksandrivka, which is about 20km away from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant they are attempting to visit. The agency writes: A source close to the mission told Interfax-Ukraine. ‘You can hear the arrivals here. But in the distance,’ it said. The movement of the column is stopped. As one of the members of the mission told the agency, ‘we are waiting when it will be safe.’ The report has also been distributed on Telegram by Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The Russian defence ministry has issued additional details of what it claims is an attempt by Ukrainian forces to sabotage or recapture the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in southern Ukraine which Russian forces have been occupying since March. Without offering any evidence, the ministry said: At 6.20am Moscow time, on the coast of the Kakhovka Reservoir, 3km northeast of the ZNPP, the Kyiv regime landed two sabotage groups of the armed forces of Ukraine with a total number of up to 60 people on seven high-speed motor boats. The saboteurs were blocked by units of the Russian guard, which were guarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and units of the Russian armed forces approached them to reinforce them. Currently, the destruction of the sabotage group of the armed forces of Ukraine with the involvement of army aviation helicopters is underway. At about 7am Moscow time, units of the Russian armed forces thwarted an attempt to land a tactical assault force of the armed forces of Ukraine on two self-propelled barges that left Nikopol a few kilometres from the ZNPP. As a result of the fire damage of the Russian armed forces, two self-propelled barges were sunk. The claims have not been independently verified. An earlier statement by the ministry gave the time of the attack as 6am. A British man has died while volunteering as a medic in Ukraine, his family has said. Craig Mackintosh, from Thetford in Norfolk, died “in the line of duty” on 24 August, his sister Lorna Mackintosh said. She has raised more than £5,000 on a GoFundMe page to bring her brother’s body back to the UK. The UK Foreign Office said it was supporting the family. Writing on the fundraising page, Mackintosh said: “Our brother bravely volunteered to go to [Ukraine] as a medic to help save lives in this war-torn country. This selfless man is currently stranded in a morgue in Ukraine and there is no help to get him home.” She said it would cost about £4,000 to return his body to the UK. “He gave his life to save others and he needs to come back home to have the service he deserves. A true hero’s service surrounded by his family and friends. Please, please help to bring our hero home.” Read more of Caroline Davies’ report here: British volunteer medic killed in Ukraine, sister says Here are some of the images that have been sent to us over the news wires of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team departing this morning in their attempt to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Energoatom, has posted again to the Telegram app to restate what it claims is the local situation. At 9.41am Kyiv time, it posted: On the morning of September 1, Energodar, a satellite city of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, came under fire from the occupying forces. A group of Russian K-52 attack helicopters “worked” over the city, striking residential areas. A mortar attack was carried out in the immediate vicinity of the territory of the ZNPP and nuclear reactors. The claims have not been independently verified. Earlier this morning, Ukraine’s city mayor of Energodar, Dmytro Orlov, posted some images which he claimed showed damage to civilian targets this morning. The images have not been independently verified. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, has said the agency would consider establishing a continued presence at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “There has been increased military activity including this morning, until very recently, a few minutes ago … but weighing the pros and cons and having come so far, we are not stopping,” Reuters reports he told journalists before setting out for the nuclear power plant. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued a statement in which it describes what it says is the latest situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant (ZNPP) this morning. Without presenting any evidence, the statement reads: Today, at about 6am Moscow time, Ukrainian troops landed on the coast of the Kakhovka Reservoir, 3 km northeast of the ZNPP plant in two sabotage groups of up to 60 people in seven boats and attempted to seize the power plant. Measures have been taken to destroy the enemy, including with the use of army aviation. In addition, from 8am Moscow time, the armed forces of Ukraine have been shelling the meeting point of the IAEA mission in the area of the settlement of Vasylivka and the ZNPP. Four shells exploded at a distance of 400m from the first power unit. The provocation of the Kyiv regime is aimed at disrupting the arrival of the IAEA working group at the ZNPP. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog from my colleague Samantha Lock. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukraine has continued offensive operations in southern Ukraine, supported by intensive long-range strikes against Russian command and logistics locations across the occupied zone over 30-31 August, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest British intelligence report reads: Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence also released video footage of Ukrainian aircraft operating high speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs). Russian has previously claimed that it has recovered fragments of these types of weapons, which are designed to locate and destroy radars. Russia prioritises strong ground-based air defences – the radar coverage which enables this is a critical capability in its Ukraine operation. A substantial, sustained degradation of Russia’s radars with HARMs would be a major set-back to Russia’s already troubled situational awareness.” It is approaching 9am in Ukraine. Here is where things stand: The Russian-held city of Energodar, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has come under attack early this morning, Ukrainian officials have said. “Since five o’clock in the morning, constant mortar attacks on the city have not stopped,” the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Energoatom, said in an update on its official Telegram channel. Energodar city mayor, Dmytro Orlov, said “several civilian objects were hit” and confirmed there were victims from the attack in a separate post to his Telegram channel. Orlov published a series of images purportedly showing damage to apartment buildings, homes and shops. Thick black smoke can be seen rising in front of one large apartment block while shopfront windows appear shattered. Another photo shows two helicopters in the sky. Today’s UN nuclear watchdog mission to inspect the Zaporizhzhia plant may be in jeopardy as Russia shells the pre-agreed route to the site, Ukrainian officials say. Russian forces are shelling the pre-agreed route to the Zaporizhzhia plant, the regional state administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. Just before 8.30am on Thursday, Oleksandr Starukh posted an update to his Telegram channel, saying: “The Russians are shelling the pre-agreed route of the IAEA mission from Zaporizhzhia to the ZNPP. The UN advance team cannot continue the movement due to security reasons.” Uncertainty hangs over the planned inspectors’ visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. “If we are able to establish a permanent presence, or a continued presence, then it’s going to be prolonged. But this first segment is going to take a few days,” said the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi. On Wednesday the Russian-occupying authorities said the team would be given access for one day. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. “The fact that we have not taken Kherson yet does not mean that the operation in the south has stalled or failed,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video messaged posted to Telegram early on Thursday morning. “It is carried out in a planned manner. We destroy enemy logistics, air defence systems, fuel and ammunition depots.” Arestovych cautioned Ukrainians to be patient, adding “there will be no quick wins”. Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Arestovych added. Ukraine’s defence ministry said the Kakhovsky and Daryiv bridges, used by Russia to transport equipment and ammunition to the region, were “disabled” in an update posted to Telegram early on Thursday. The Russian military has “severe manpower shortages” and is seeking to recruit contract service members and may even draw in convicted criminals, a US official has said, citing US intelligence. The official said this may include “compelling wounded soldiers to re-enter combat, acquiring personnel from private security companies, and paying bonuses to conscripts”. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. The German government rejects the claim, calling it a “pretence”. It said Nord Stream was “fully operational” and that there were no technical issues. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, said Gazprom, the Russian state energy company. The EU has agreed to suspend a visa travel deal with Moscow. The bloc aims to curb the number of Russian nationals entering for holidays and shopping, but is stopping short of a full tourist visa ban. Meeting in Prague, the EU’s 27 foreign ministers promised to suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it relatively easy to obtain travel documents. Today’s UN nuclear watchdog mission to inspect the Zaporizhzhia plant may be in jeopardy as Russia shells the pre-agreed route to the site, Ukrainian officials say. Earlier this morning we reported that the Russian-held city of Energodar, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, came under attack, according to Ukrainian officials in the region. The regional state administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region is now saying Russian forces are shelling the pre-agreed route officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be taking to access the nuclear plant. Just before 8.30am on Thursday, Oleksandr Starukh posted an update to his Telegram channel, saying: The Russians are shelling the pre-agreed route of the IAEA mission from Zaporizhzhia to the ZNPP. The UN advance team cannot continue the movement due to security reasons. Ukraine continues to make efforts to organise safe access of the international IAEA mission to the ZNPP. We demand that the Russian Federation stop the provocations and grant the IAEA unhindered access to the Ukrainian nuclear facility.” Energodar city mayor, Dmytro Orlov, has released some more information regarding the shelling on the city next to the nuclear plant this morning. Orlov published a series of images purportedly showing damage to apartment buildings, homes and shops. Thick black smoke can be seen rising in front of one large apartment block while shopfront windows appear shattered. Another photo shows two helicopters in the sky. Orlov writes: The very murderers of the civilian population, who are shelling Energodar in the morning with mortars, machine guns and shelling, have used aviation (helicopters are circling over the city) have already reported the dead and wounded as a result of their shelling‼️ The mayor added that he has received information that there may be civilian casualties and residential buildings have been hit. The Russian-held city of Energodar, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has come under attack early this morning, Ukrainian officials say. The Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Energoatom, posted an update to its official Telegram channel just before 8am local time.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. Oleksiy Arestovych reiterated the offensive was still very much underway in a video messaged posted to Telegram early on Thursday morning. The fact that we have not taken Kherson yet does not mean that the operation in the south has stalled or failed. It is carried out in a planned manner. We destroy enemy logistics, air defence systems, fuel and ammunition depots. … There will be no quick wins. Initially, a strategy was taken to systematically grind Putin’s army. It is long, so there is a lot of work to be done. Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Arestovych added. Ukraine’s defence ministry said the Kakhovsky and Daryiv bridges, used by Russia to transport equipment and ammunition to the region, were “disabled” in an update posted to Telegram early on Thursday. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are due to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant today after arriving in Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia city on Wednesday. The technical mission aims to prevent a nuclear accident. However, uncertainty hangs over the planned inspectors’ visit. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, told reporters from Zaporizhzhia city on Wednesday: If we are able to establish a permanent presence, or a continued presence, then it’s going to be prolonged. But this first segment is going to take a few days.” On Wednesday the Russian-occupying authorities said the team would be given access for one day. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are due to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant today after arriving in Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia city on Wednesday. The technical mission aims to prevent a nuclear accident. Meanwhile, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim the souther region of Kherson has not stalled or failed. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. “The fact that we have not taken Kherson yet does not mean that the operation in the south has stalled or failed,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video messaged posted to Telegram early on Thursday morning. “It is carried out in a planned manner.

The official said this may include “compelling wounded soldiers to re-enter combat, acquiring personnel from private security companies, and paying bonuses to conscripts”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the Venice film festival, describing Russia’s war on Ukraine as “a primitive plot in three acts for the world to make three dramatic mistakes: to get used to the war, to put up with the war, to forget about the war”. Zelenskiy told the audience “not to remain silent” and “not to remain neutral”. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. The German government rejects the claim, calling it a “pretence”. It said Nord Stream was “fully operational” and that there were no technical issues. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, said Gazprom, the Russian state energy company. Estonia aims to stop most Russians from entering within weeks, its foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, has said. “It takes some time, but I think timing is also critical, looking at these vast numbers of Russian citizens entering.” The EU has agreed to suspend a visa travel deal with Moscow. The bloc aims to curb the number of Russian nationals entering for holidays and shopping, but is stopping short of a full tourist visa ban. Meeting in Prague, the EU’s 27 foreign ministers promised to suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it relatively easy to obtain travel documents. Zelenskiy welcomed the EU visa measure. “I think it is humiliating for Europe when it is considered as just one big boutique or restaurant,” he said. “When the citizens of the state that wants to destroy European values use Europe for their entertainment or shopping, for the vacation of their mistresses while they themselves work for the war or to simply silently wait out the immoral fall of Russia.” The US obtained a warrant to seize a $45m airplane owned by Russian energy firm Lukoil, the US justice department said, though the aircraft is currently believed to be in Russia. The aircraft reportedly flew into and out of Russia in violation of US department of commerce sanctions. G7 finance ministers will discuss the Biden administration’s proposed price cap on Russian oil when they meet on Friday, the White House said. “This is the most effective way, we believe, to hit hard at Putin’s revenue and doing so will result in not only a drop in Putin’s oil revenue, but also global energy prices as well,” said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-ten-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T14:21:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 10 of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-ten-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-ten-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 10 of the Russian invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has demanded a new round of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters. He has been discussing the situation with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who is in eastern Europe. The International Monetary Fund has announced that it could approve $1.4bn emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s “severe impact” on the global economy. The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured just on Friday in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights, as reported by BuzzFeed. Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honoured by Russia. The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately” in new guidelines published today by the US state department. Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. Partial ceasefire talks in the cities of Volnovakha and Mariupol are “ongoing” after Ukraine accused Russia of continuing attacks despite agreeing to allow civilians to flee. Ukraine has said attacks on the cities continued on Saturday, meaning the evacuation of civilians had to be halted. Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine’s statehood will be threatened if its leaders continued to resist his military invasion. He also described western sanctions on Russia as being akin to a declaration of war. The number of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency has said. The figure is currently above 1.3 million. Zelenskiy said Nato has given the “green light for further bombing of Ukraine” by ruling out a no-fly zone. He said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity.” Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said. Britain has urged UK nationals to consider leaving Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes,” the Foreign Office said. Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth at least €140m (£115m) from four high-profile Russians who were placed on an EU sanctions list, sources told Reuters. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack. An emergency summit of the UN security council was summoned after the attack on Zaporizhzhia. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the world narrowly averted a “nuclear catastrophe” and condemned Russia’s actions as “reckless” and “dangerous”. The US embassy in Ukraine says the attack on the nuclear plant is a war crime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T19:46:34Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Latham eyes NSW kingmaker role, new secret ministries discovery, gas shortage fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: Latham eyes NSW kingmaker role, new secret ministries discovery, gas shortage fear","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Morning, everyone.

The facility in Lower Saxony, which is owned by the Czech energy company EGH, has received emergency permission to run until April in an attempt to boost energy production. The move has been described by Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, a leading Green, as a necessary evil, as he acknowledged it was a considerable setback to the country’s attempts to tackle the climate crisis. Meanwhile, Germany’s Greens ruled out lengthening the life of nuclear power plants due to be mothballed by the end of the year. Ricarda Lang, the head of the Greens, who are in a coalition government with the Social Democrats and the pro-business FDP, said such a move would not happen as long as her party was in government. She rejected calls from the FDP finance minister, Christian Lindner, to keep open until about 2024 if necessary three nuclear power plants due to stop operation by the end of this year. Germany is heavily reliant on Russian gas, and supplies through its largest pipeline, Nord Stream 1 via the Baltic Sea, are currently at about 20% of expected levels, in what has been widely interpreted as a retaliatory move by Moscow over sanctions imposed as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. Politicians have warned of crisis conditions this winter and next as Germany tries to tackle the energy shortfall. Restrictions have been put on the heating of public buildings including swimming pools and town halls, and businesses have been asked to allow employers to work at home as far as possible to avoid the heating of big office blocks. Industry and the public are being urged to curb energy consumption. Resuming the use of nuclear power plants, which the government of Angela Merkel said in 2011 Germany would turn its back on as a result of the Fukushima nuclear accident, is seen as a very difficult option. It would involve committing to years of investment, and there is a shortfall in the necessary equipment, knowhow and human resources. Lang, in a wide-ranging interview with Die Zeit, said there was no future for nuclear power in Germany. “What Christian Lindner is proposing is nothing more than once again starting up the nuclear power industry,” she said. “And that will not happen, on our watch at least.” She complained about a “lack of seriousness” in the debate, which has been raging for weeks. “Atomic power is a highly risky technology,” Lang said, acknowledging at the same time that many Germans were concerned after the reduction in gas from Russia. “But we need answers that actually suit the problem,” she said. “We have a warmth problem, not an electricity problem.” She said atomic power could replace to only a small degree the failing gas supplies. The three nuclear plants that remain running supply the equivalent of about 6% of Germany’s electricity needs, and some of the energy is exported to France. Last year 12.6% of Germany’s electricity – 65.2bn kW hours – was produced by gas power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/26/boris-johnson-insights-worth-2-million-pity-couldnt-have-had-them-while-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s insights are worth £2.5m.

Pity we couldn’t have had them while he was PM","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s what any caring billionaire half longs for, half dreads: the moment his charge takes the first, faltering steps from dependence towards self-sufficiency. For Lord Bamford, who with his wife has been supporting Boris Johnson with everything from a free wedding to country and town houses, there will inevitably be worries that their protege is not quite ready to stand on his own two feet. Of course, it’s adorable that the recently struggling politician feels able, according to recent reports, to buy a £4m house with a moat for his latest family, but it’s also natural if his benefactors – Bamford not being the only such philanthropist – fear that the notionally sitting MP might one day overtax the patience of the international speaking circuit. Johnson recently signed up, with an advance of £2.5m, to the Harry Walker Agency in New York. The agency is presumably familiar with Jeremy Vine’s immortal description of their talent’s deliberately shambolic performances, probably best received when his audiences were financiers and drunk. Maybe sober US audiences will also enjoy the routine where Johnson pretends to forget who he’s addressing, then pretends to forget the punchline to his own joke. But can even exceptional gullibility on the part of corporate clients guarantee the Johnsons their new independence, minus protectors, distant relations offering loans? It will obviously help if potential customers never see Johnson’s “Peppa Pig” speech to the CBI, featuring his own rhetorical rule of three – “forgive me”, “forgive me”, “forgive me” – and trademark audience involvement: “Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World!” Given that neither colossal misjudgment nor occasional muteness damaged the US speaking prospects of those unlikely entertainers David Cameron and Theresa May, it may be that foreign audiences won’t mind about, if they’re even aware of, Johnson’s workplace priapism and prodigious lying. Actually, those qualities might be of less concern to the average US business convention than the discovery that their company’s chosen British loser is one whose legendary oratorical skills were exposed from the beginning of his premiership as first dismal, then excruciating and, by the end, non-existent. The threadbare nature of his last speeches – “them’s the breaks”; “hasta la vista, baby” – could not more perfectly have matched the derelict state of his leadership. If marginally less likely to stupefy international audiences than his predecessors, Johnson could well become the first to insult them, whether directly or with clowning or nursery allusions, showing he thinks them too stupid to realise that these represent his entire understanding. His last set piece, at the Sizewell nuclear plant, began: “Now, when I was a child, I had a wonderful book – a much-thumbed Ladybird book called The Story of Nuclear Power.” And, you know what, he feels the same about nuclear power today. Long before he quoted Kermit the Frog at the UN general assembly, British audiences were aware that Johnson’s inability to match his language to the occasion was not so much clumsiness, more a moral failure to stop showing off. Not once in the pandemic did he respond with appropriate feeling and dignity; rather, public suffering was a hook for gags – “Operation Last Gasp”, “squash the sombrero” – or his other speciality, bellicose hyperbole. In fact, Ukraine came along just when Johnson would have been missing the pandemic’s pretexts for what he fancied to be Churchillian exhortation. “Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.” “Mr Johnson is sought after for his illuminating insights on global security, the world economy and his continued work supporting freedom around the world,” says the Harry Walker Agency. It’s one way of describing turns likely to feature a cartoon character, a tale showcasing his own eccentricity, unfettered boasting, a few insults and some all-purpose noises to the effect that, regardless of the facts, the future is glorious. Will the US agency be supervising him? Because without some equivalent of the Foreign Office staff who stopped Johnson embarrassing himself (James Bond was not born in Estoril) or slighting his hosts (“No. Not appropriate”), the Bamfords should perhaps not assume they are done with caring responsibilities. Already, a favourite, much-rehearsed Johnson anecdote about comical Indian dancing hand-movements (“lightbulb, lightbulb, motorbike, motorbike”) – first aired in a Spectator diary (that also featured a Chinese woman’s “velly solly”) – seems to have been coolly received by Indians present, last November, at the Hindustan Times leadership summit. Johnson fee: £261,652. Days later, the financier Mike Bloomberg apologised to guests at Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore after Johnson described China as “coercive autocracy” to around 500 Asian business people, investors and diplomats. “Some may have been insulted or offended last night by parts of the speaker’s remarks,” Bloomberg said. “The presentation was meant as after-dinner entertainment rather than serious discussion of important controversial and complex issues.” And there was, to be fair, a hilarious section when Johnson condemned those showing “a candid disregard for the rule of international law”, also countries whose “disastrous mistakes” have “demonstrated the immense limitations of their political systems”. Frustratingly for bookers keen to hire this promising rival to Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson, Lee “Caino” Cain and other Covid-era performers, Johnson’s office insists that he is – whatever Bloomberg said – a highly serious and important statesman: “He will continue to make the case for freedom and democracy on the world stage.” The difficulties already obvious with this plan could explain why Johnson is now making a such nuisance of himself, almost as if he really does plan to boomerang back from a home-moat and £32,000 an hour to a prime minister’s salary and a Lulu Lytle begging bowl. Whether it’s by showily pronouncing on the Northern Ireland deal or styling himself lonely saviour of Ukraine, Johnson needs these gestures to prove to international clients what he forgot to demonstrate in office – that he’s all grown up. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Wednesday’s report criticises the initial stages of the program to build nine new Hunter-class frigates for the Royal Australian Navy – a process that occurred during the former Coalition government’s time in office. The report’s release coincided with the Labor government introducing new legislation to pave the way for another complex and expensive shipbuilding project: acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. The Australian National Audit Office (Anao) found that the Department of Defence’s management of the Hunter class procurement had been only “partly effective”. “Defence’s procurement process and related advisory processes lacked a value for money focus, and key records, including the rationale for the procurement approach, were not retained,” the report tabled in parliament said. “Contract expenditure to date has not been effective in delivering on project milestones, and the project is experiencing an 18-month delay and additional costs due in large part to design immaturity.” The report said the design issues had driven up the cost to Defence by $423m so far. But it added: “At January 2023 the project was forecast to exceed the whole of project budget approved by government by a significant amount.” The Turnbull government announced in June 2018 that the Hunter class frigates would be designed by the British company BAE Systems and built at the Osborne shipyard in Adelaide. The then government said it had made the decision after “a rigorous and comprehensive competitive evaluation process” that had also considered options from Italy’s Fincantieri and Spain’s Navantia. But the Anao found the advice provided to the government was “not complete”, because Defence had failed to make clear that a value-for-money assessment had not been conducted. Defence recommended the BAE option “based primarily on anti-submarine warfare capability”, but some documents surrounding the process were not retained, the report said. The contract management plan was established only three and a half years after the contract was executed. Responding to the Anao report, the Department of Defence agreed to two recommendations to improve its processes, but disputed the findings. “Defence demonstrably considered value for money throughout the procurement process,” the department said. But the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the Anao report “demonstrates yet again the bungling and mismanagement of critical defence projects by the former Coalition government”. The Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the “scathing” report placed “even more question marks around the capacity of Defence to deliver” the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project. A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: “The Hunter program continues to make strong progress and we have begun building the first schedule protection block – which will be used in the first ship. We remain committed to building nine anti-submarine warfare frigates for the Royal Australian Navy.” The Hunter class frigate program is under fresh scrutiny because the Albanese government has ordered a new review of the navy’s surface fleet needs. The retired US navy Vice-Admiral William Hilarides – who has long been a source of advice to successive Australian governments on naval matters – is one of three people appointed to conduct the review over the next few months. The others are the former Department of Finance secretary Rosemary Huxtable and retired Royal Australian Navy Vice-Admiral Stuart Mayer. They will consider whether any changes are needed to the navy’s surface fleet plans in light of the decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. On Wednesday the government introduced a bill to clarify that the existing ban on civil nuclear power in Australia does not prevent “conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”. The submarine program is expected to cost between $268bn and $368bn over the period from now to the mid-2050s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/21/art-attack-can-vandalism-be-justified-to-save-the-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-21T15:55:35Z","webTitle":"Art attack: can vandalism be justified to save the planet? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/21/art-attack-can-vandalism-be-justified-to-save-the-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/21/art-attack-can-vandalism-be-justified-to-save-the-planet","fields":{"headline":"Art attack: can vandalism be justified to save the planet?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am fully supportive of the Just Stop Oil campaign, and acknowledge the need for rousing tactics to counteract a business-as-usual mentality. However, the attack on Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting was misguided (Just Stop Oil activists throw soup at Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, 14 October). Van Gogh cared deeply for nature, and for humanity; he was a missionary before he became a painter. He was poor, he lived simply, and his passion was to reveal the extraordinary beauty of nature to those who could not see it. For his magnificent gift to humanity to become a target for environmentalists is a violation of all that the painting upholds. Over the ages, art, creativity and imagination have kept alive exactly that which Just Stop Oil is fighting for. The legacy of artists such as Van Gogh should be cared for by us with gratitude; to deface such works discredits the protesters’ own calls for a better, more selfless vision of humanity. Jennifer Leach Reading, Berkshire • The answer to the question posed by the Just Stop Oil activist Phoebe Plummer, “What is worth more, art or life?” is life, and the habitability of our planet. I wonder how Van Gogh would have responded to the same question. The life-affirming spirit in his art suggests that he would say that life, whether individual life or life in general, is worth more than a particular artefact. Philip Courtenay Basingstoke, Hampshire • George Monbiot (Do we really care more about Van Gogh’s sunflowers than real ones?, 19 October) is right to highlight the climate protester’s dilemma: protests will be ignored unless they cross a line that many find unacceptable, especially when it comes to using well-loved masterpieces in the National Gallery to make the point. Perhaps the gallery could solve this problem by erecting a banner saying “Just Stop Oil” across its Trafalgar Square front, to show which side it’s on. Lance Fennell Milton Keynes • George Monbiot asks: “What are the democratic means of contesting the government’s decision to award more than 100 new licences to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea?” What would he do if half of the motorways in the UK were blocked by demonstrators who wanted us to shut down all our nuclear power stations, and the other half were blocked by demonstrators demanding that nuclear power stations should supply all of our electricity?

Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi also dismissed calls to evacuate civilians from some cities worst hit by energy shortages as “inappropriate”. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said on Monday, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, countered that the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant was a Russian tactic aiming to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police have raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution centre in the town of Orihiv in south-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 70 miles east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was “grateful” and that the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added while speaking at a conference in Berlin. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station before troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said the US ambassador at large, Beth Van Schaack. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. The Kremlin said it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there were no plans to call up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high.” Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnieper River, the Svatove sector is likely a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people.

The chief executive, Chris O’Shea, said he is keen for Centrica to become the “first company” to sign up to new, renegotiated contracts with the government on its electricity generation, amid controversy over windfall gains. As part of Liz Truss’s £150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators will be asked to supply electricity below current market rates – but the new prime minister has refused to impose a windfall tax on them. Ministers plan to “negotiate” with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. As well as being the UK’s biggest supplier of gas and electricity to households via British Gas, Centrica is also a big generator via its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations. O’Shea said Centrica is willing to switch the five nuclear plants to the new-style contracts. He said he was even prepared to draw up long-term contracts with the government for Centrica’s North Sea gas fields, which are not covered by the initiative and have already been subject to the windfall tax announced earlier this year by the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. North Sea oil and gas extraction does not currently receive subsidies. O’Shea said he had discussed the idea, backed by industry body Energy UK, with the government and talks are ongoing. “We are in this business for the long term. We’re not in this business to maximise our profit this year,” he said. Energy firms have supported the “contracts for difference” (CfD) proposals, which give investors certainty over the levels of returns they can receive, potentially years after the energy crisis has abated. However, the Resolution Foundation has warned that the policy risked “delaying but locking in” windfall gains. There are concerns that the government negotiating team, led by the former head of the vaccines taskforce, Madelaine McTernan, is in a weak position as it will need to convince generators to forgo high short-term prices. O’Shea declined to say what proportion of its profits he was prepared to relinquish or how much the company hopes to receive from government. He told the Guardian: “Sometimes if you go to the government and propose you take a lower price they look at you like there must be something else in it for you. “We are obviously in this business to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, country [and] colleagues. But it’s not about maximising this year’s profits; it’s about having a long-term sustainable business. “We supply more than 8m homes and businesses in the UK with energy – if they can’t afford their energy, we don’t have a sustainable business. And so when you think about this holistically … if we put something like a CfD regime in place for existing assets then, God forbid, if this ever happens again and we see prices go where they go, there’s an automatic adjustment mechanism.” O’Shea said the “risky” nature of commodity markets can hang over investments. “If you put a floor on the price that can be achieved, you eliminate a huge amount of the risks,” he added. Centrica holds its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet through a joint venture with France’s EDF, which is also understood to be supportive of the proposals. The scale of the windfall from surging gas prices was underlined in July when Centrica reported first-half operating profits of £1.3bn and handed £59m to shareholders. The company said it had seen an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 a megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/MWh. The company posted a surge in half-year profits from the division containing its exploration and production, and nuclear operations – reaching £906m, up from £75m. O’Shea said that alternative suggestions to cap wholesale gas prices could “distort the market massively and have perverse consequences”. Asked if he was backing the CfD proposal to fend off a potential windfall tax, O’Shea responded: “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off. It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” Last month British Gas announced it will donate 10% of its profits to help its poorer customers manage rising gas and electricity bills for the “duration of the energy crisis”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/mar/10/trevor-noah-putin-oil-seth-meyers-stephen-colbert","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah: Putin has ‘shined a spotlight’ on fossil fuel dependency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/10/trevor-noah-putin-oil-seth-meyers-stephen-colbert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/mar/10/trevor-noah-putin-oil-seth-meyers-stephen-colbert","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah: Putin has ‘shined a spotlight’ on fossil fuel dependency","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Trevor Noah On Wednesday’s Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined why the European Union would be unable to join a US boycott of Russian energy imports. “While America is able to go cold turkey on Russian oil, Europe is hooked,” he explained. The EU gets 40% of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia, “which is why they couldn’t join this boycott even if they wanted to.” The arrangement gives Russia leverage, and Vladimir Putin is using it by threatening to cut off Europe’s gas supply. “You see, you can’t go too hard after the country that makes it possible for you to survive winter,” Noah noted. “That’s why Europe always has to pepper its denunciations of Russia with like the occasional compliment – ‘this war in Ukraine is as inexcusable as Tchaikovsky’s music is unforgettable, huh?’” But it’s a two-way street, he continued. “Sure, Europe needs Russian oil, but Russia needs Europe’s money. I mean, what else do they have to offer? It’s not like they’re going to fund a war by selling cabbage soup.” “So both sides of this relationship are in a game of chicken and nobody knows who’s going to give,” he added. What is clear is that Europe and the US shouldn’t be in this situation in the first place. “Putin has shined a spotlight on the trade-offs that dependency on fossil fuels creates,” said Noah. “If countries want to move to renewable energy or safe nuclear power, they can no longer afford to make that, like, item number 10 on the agenda,” he concluded. “Because not only will the planet suffer, but you’ll find yourself constantly having to make deals with the devil.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also tore into the devil’s bargain of US fossil fuel dependence. In response to Russia’s escalation of its invasion of Ukraine, Biden announced a ban on all Russian energy imports, “which might make this a good time to pause and acknowledge how insane it is that we continue to buy oil from brutal regimes like Russia and Saudi Arabia,” Meyers noted. The ban would only send the US to buy oil from other brutal dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, Meyers explained. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could generate our own clean energy through renewable sources like wind and solar instead of begging murderous crazy people not to gouge us? Then at least we wouldn’t have to watch another US president hold a weird glowing orb or do a sword dance with Saudi royals like he’s auditioning for a non-flipping role in Cirque du Soleil,” he said over photos of Trump’s fawning visit to Saudi Arabia. Energy independence through domestic, renewable production would be “so much better for so many obvious reasons”, Meyers added, including the fact that it would take power away from repressive oil-based dictatorships. “Right now they have far too much power over both global and domestic politics,” he said, pointing to record-high gas prices. “The numbers are so shocking that I drove by a station that had ‘viewer discretion advised’ on the sign,” he quipped. But while some Republicans have blamed the prices on Biden, Meyers pointed to oil company profits, which surged to $174bn in 2021. “Maybe they could use some of that money to lower gas prices instead of stock buybacks or shooting glossy commercials full of healthy-looking sea turtles,” he said. Stephen Colbert And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert took stock of Russia’s financial future after the credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Russian securities to a C rating. The change reflected their view that “a sovereign default is imminent”. “Russia is about to lose everything and crash with a buddy, I guess,” said Colbert. “Belarus better have a big couch, because without a credit rating, the only way they can pay their debt is by having a garage sale at Lenin’s tomb. Every pickled corpse must go.” As a new Iron Curtain appears evermore imminent, Russians are hoarding items from Ikea, H&amp;M and Zara before they become “relics of a bygone era”, according to the Washington Post. “It’s amazing that they think anything from H&amp;M will last long enough to become a relic,” joked Colbert. Several US companies are shutting down operations in the country, including McDonald’s. “And with the golden arches closing down, Russians are going to have to settle for their local chain: McDostoevsky’s, home of their kids meal, the Box of Sadness,” Colbert quipped. Coca-Cola and Pepsi also announced suspensions of business in Russia; Coke is suspending all operations, while PepsiCo said it would continue to sell potato chips and some daily essentials such as milk, cheese and baby formula. “To which Russian babies said: are you sure you don’t have Coke?” Colbert riffed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/13/why-did-national-grid-use-coal-to-meet-surge-in-electricity-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-13T16:57:29Z","webTitle":"Why did National Grid use coal to meet surge in electricity demand?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/13/why-did-national-grid-use-coal-to-meet-surge-in-electricity-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/13/why-did-national-grid-use-coal-to-meet-surge-in-electricity-demand","fields":{"headline":"Why did National Grid use coal to meet surge in electricity demand?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Monday, in order to meet extra demand to power air conditioning, National Grid broke a 46-day run in which coal had not been used to generate electricity in Britain. But as the country swelters in the heat, commentators and green campaigners have asked why coal and not renewables were used to plug the gap. What actually happened? Late on Sunday night, after a day in which temperatures had topped 30C in some parts of the country, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) requested that the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plant be readied to burn coal to generate power. The ESO is tasked with balancing electricity supply and demand. Germany’s Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire power station, brought one unit into action on Monday morning, with a second following in the late afternoon to support the evening peak. Several factors had combined to put strain on the grid: the surge in demand for aircon; a fault on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector with Norway that meant the power the subsea cable was carrying to the UK was reduced by half; and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which cut supplies. So the UK is still reliant on coal? No, the fossil fuel is a small and shrinking part of the UK’s energy system. However, fears over gas shortages in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced the UK and other nations to turn to it as a backup over the winter. In Britain, three coal plants, – Ratcliffe, EDF’s West Burton A and Drax in North Yorkshire – were paid to be kept on standby amid fears a cold snap and a lack of gas could cause blackouts. In the event, they were largely unused. In February, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, asked Drax and EDF to delay their stations’ planned decommissioning, but that suggestion was snubbed. Ratcliffe, meanwhile, is due to close in September 2024 – the date Britain has committed to end coal-fired generation. One unit at the site that had been due to close in 2022 will now close in September 2024, at the same time as the other three units. How much does switching on coal cost? Industry sources estimated that Uniper was paid about £500,000 for Monday’s actions. For context, some gas-fired power stations were paid as much as £12m on the tightest winter days. Keeping plants on standby under the winter contingency coal contracts cost about £400m. The cost of balancing the grid has been in the spotlight in recent months, amid calls for the profits of gas-fired power plants’ owners to be capped. Why aren’t we just turning to renewables? Britain’s wind sector has grown in recent years, and now typically accounts for about a quarter of electricity generation. But wind production slumped in the still conditions of the heatwave, forcing the ESO to seek other options. With the sun beaming down, solar picked up some of that slack – providing about 20% of power. As Britain has only a small amount of battery storage, there is little ability to hoard that renewable power for use when the wind drops and the sun doesn’t shine. An industry argument is raging over waiting times to connect up renewable projects, including battery storage, which would allow a swifter transition away from using fossil fuels to generate power. How prepared are we for a heating planet? The Climate Change Committee has said that the UK is “strikingly unprepared” for the impacts of the climate crisis. The independent body said a number of areas needed addressing, including heat-proofing homes, stemming leaks from water supply pipes and preparing for flash floods. For households, this could be mean costly retrofitting, but little official guidance has been issued. The introduction of a government “Future Homes Standard” is still two years away. Guidance for local authorities issued earlier this year said: “Planning policy across the UK addresses the issues associated with climate change, but action has been delayed, inconsistent and de-prioritised for too long.” Greenpeace’s Ami McCarthy labelled the firing up of the coal units a “sign of failure”, adding: “If our homes were properly insulated, they’d keep us cool in the summer as well as warm in the winter, plus some heat pumps can cool as well as heat homes.” Worldwide, it is estimated that as many as a billion extra air conditioning units will be sold before the end of the decade, driven in part by demand in China and India where both incomes and temperatures are rising, creating a vicious cycle when much of the electricity used to power them is generated by fossil fuels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/22/the-absurd-arithmetic-behind-centrica-bosss-bonus","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T07:03:31Z","webTitle":"The absurd arithmetic behind Centrica boss’s bonus | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/22/the-absurd-arithmetic-behind-centrica-bosss-bonus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/22/the-absurd-arithmetic-behind-centrica-bosss-bonus","fields":{"headline":"The absurd arithmetic behind Centrica boss’s bonus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A year ago, Chris O’Shea was in solidarity mode. The chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, didn’t take an annual bonus because it would be “wrong” to do so when so many customers were on the wrong end of soaring energy bills. The financial hardships haven’t obviously become any less hard over the past 12 months (especially for those unfortunate enough to be visited by a British Gas-appointed prepayment meter fitter) but O’Shea will take his full whack this time, including an annual bonus of £1.4m within an overall tally of £4.5m. Examples of FTSE 100 chief executives waiving a bonus two years in a row are as rare as hen’s teeth, so we shouldn’t be surprised. And, in O’Shea’s case, it seems the chair of Centrica’s remuneration committee, Carol Arrowsmith, wasn’t wholly impressed by last year’s little gesture. “We cannot expect to attract and retain leaders in the future if we do not meet our commitment to recognise and reward the performance and talent of our people,” she wrote in the annual report. Arrowsmith could more usefully have asked what, actually, this bonus scheme was rewarding. The targets for a bumper payout weren’t merely achieved, but cleared by absurdly wide margins for the reason everybody knows: Russia invaded Ukraine and wholesale energy prices soared. While Centrica didn’t make much money from British Gas, its North Sea gas assets and its 20% stake in the UK’s fleet of nuclear power were perfectly positioned to benefit from the market-wide volatility. Returns exceeded wildest expectations. Thus the target for earnings per share – comprising 37.5% of O’Shea’s bonus formula – very quickly became a breeze. It was 6.1p with a maximum set at 8.6p. Actual outcome: 34.9p. Or, even more absurdly, look at the target for cash and debt, which falls within the “balanced scorecard” that made up another 37.5% of the bonus calculation. The remuneration committee thought O’Shea would be doing well to get Centrica to a position of net cash of £12m. The achieved figure was £1.2bn. In the same vein, targets for cashflow and operating profit were cleared with £2bn to spare. O’Shea may indeed have shown “outstanding leadership, drive and determination”, as Arrowsmith maintains, but it is also true that he could have spent 12 months on the golf course and still hit most of his targets. The bonus scheme became a winning lottery ticket. Now that wholesale energy prices are falling, it is possible that luck will work against O’Shea this year and the next set of targets will become impossibly out of reach. In that respect – and if O’Shea had not banged on in the past about how he’s not motivated by money – one could almost sympathise with his decision to take the lolly. He might do a terrific job this year and get zero bonus. One can have no such sympathy for Arrowsmith. She’s a remuneration consultant by trade and this remuneration scheme was a shocker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-277-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T15:15:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 277 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-277-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-277-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 277 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. Civilians in Kherson are leaving the city to flee Russian shelling, just weeks after celebrating Ukraine’s recapture of the southern city. Reports said a line of trucks, vans and cars – some towing trailers or ferrying out pets and other belongings – stretched a kilometre or more on the outskirts of Kherson on Saturday. The Belgium prime minister, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, was on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday. Accompanied by Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around 37.4 million euros. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. There are growing fears Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of the unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday but two generators were damaged in the process. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has warned rape in war violates international values as severely as the use of chemical weapons amid evidence of the “abhorrent act” being used in Ukraine. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Josef Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships can be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian. Belarus’s long-time foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has died. Belarus has been an ally of Russia and a base over the border for the invasion of Ukraine. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel that “we are shocked by the reports of the death”. Makei had been due to meet Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Minsk on Monday. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. Russia is firing ageing cruise missiles stripped of their nuclear warheads at Ukrainian targets because Vladimir Putin’s stocks are so depleted, the UK Ministry of Defence has suggested. An intelligence update from the ministry on Saturday said the desperate improvisation by the Russian president’s struggling forces were “unlikely to achieve reliable effects”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/24/ukraine-polish-tanks-arrive-new-sanctions-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-24T21:32:08Z","webTitle":"Polish Leopard tanks arrive in Ukraine as west piles new sanctions on Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/ukraine-polish-tanks-arrive-new-sanctions-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/24/ukraine-polish-tanks-arrive-new-sanctions-russia","fields":{"headline":"Polish Leopard tanks arrive in Ukraine as west piles new sanctions on Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, as western allies including the G7 and EU announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia, in a renewed effort to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Speaking on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv. As ceremonies to remember the dead took place in Kyiv, western allies sought to demonstrate their support. Ukraine’s blue and yellow colours were projected on the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the Empire State Building and EU headquarters, and were painted on the street by activists outside the Russian embassy in London. On Friday evening the G7 announced it was determined to strengthen sanctions and take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports, a controversial issue for Europe. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. In a joint statement, G7 leaders said: “We call on third-countries or other international actors who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing material support to Russia’s war, or face severe costs.” Ahead of the G7 meeting, the US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drones include the Switchblade 600, a bigger version of the loitering munition (or kamikaze drone) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump 20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The US commerce department will list more than 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. The Biden administration has become increasingly vocal about Chinese aid to the Russian war machine, and has raised concerns recently that Beijing is contemplating supplying weapons directly. The companies named would be blocked from purchasing hi-tech items such as semiconductors made in the US, or using US technology abroad. Tariffs will be raised on imports from Russia of more than 100 metals, minerals and chemical products, including aluminium smelt or cast in Russia, worth an estimated $2.8bn (£2.3bn) in revenue to Moscow. Unveiling its latest sanctions, the UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and their children. UK sanctions also target 34 top officials from Russia’s two largest defence companies, Rostec and Almaz-Antey, and four banks. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said sanctions were working. “Russia is falling backwards towards an autarkic economy cut away from the world. Our sanctions are eroding sharply its economic base, slashing any prospect to modernise it,” she said in Tallinn, where she attended ceremonies to mark Estonia’s independence day. The EU agreed late on Friday to ban on exports of critical technologies to Russia, as part of a 10th round of sanctions. Despite plans to have the measures in place by the first anniversary of the invasion, the measures were held up by a last-minute dispute over how quickly to ban synthetic rubber imports from Russia. Italy objected to a rapid phase-out, while Poland blindsided other member states with its insistence the trade be stopped as soon as possible. EU diplomats voiced frustration that Poland, one of the bloc’s most hawkish voices on sanctions, was prepared to hold up a deal over a relatively minor issue. Some sources attributed Warsaw’s position to hopes of gaining ground for its domestic rubber industry. “Poland is basically stopping this whole package on 24 February to carve out some putative advantage for the Polish rubber industry,” said one diplomat. Morawiecki had said earlier the package was “too soft, too weak” and called on allies to adopt a tougher position. Poland eventually climbed down on an immediate ban; a Polish diplomat said they accepted a deal on six conditions, including launching work to sanction 150 Russian propagandists and a review clause on rubber imports. Talks between the 27 member states this week also became bogged down over a proposal to fine European companies and individuals if they failed to report on the location of Russian state assets. That idea was dropped as member states said they needed more time to study the idea. The latest EU package will ban the export of components for drones and helicopters, as well as spare parts for vehicles, items that were found on the battlefields of Ukraine and were missed off previous sanctions lists. Western countries are increasingly concerned about Russia’s ability to dodge sanctions by sourcing technology from front companies or friendly exporters in neighbouring countries. EU and UK exports to Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, all members of the Eurasian Customs Union with Russia and Belarus, jumped by between 15% and 90% following the invasion of Ukraine, according to a paper by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released on Friday. The increase was particularly marked for sanctioned goods no longer available to Russia, and showed “a pattern suggestive of new supply chains”, the authors said. Western officials have also noted with concern the growth in Russian trade with the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China. Officials are now studying how to prevent sanctions dodging, via a mix of persuasion or threats to cut market access. Meanwhile, the US has this week begun disbursing $9.9bn in financial assistance to help fund healthcare, education and emergency services in Ukraine, while the G7 as a whole has increased its commitment of budget and economic support to $39bn for this year. Part of the US assistance will be a third delivery by the energy department of equipment to help patch the Ukrainian power grid equipment which has been weakened by repeated Russian missile attacks over the course of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/07/national-grid-power-plants-coldest-night-of-year-extra-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T16:43:37Z","webTitle":"National Grid puts backup coal plants into action for first time this winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/07/national-grid-power-plants-coldest-night-of-year-extra-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/07/national-grid-power-plants-coldest-night-of-year-extra-electricity","fields":{"headline":"National Grid puts backup coal plants into action for first time this winter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"National Grid has called coal plants put on standby as emergency backup into action for the first time this winter, before the coldest night of the year. Two units at EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power for the grid on Tuesday afternoon. Their output will be ramped up depending on how much electricity can be generated from other sources. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK, with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. A combination of freezing temperatures pushing up demand for power and heating, and low wind cutting windfarm electricity generation have made generation conditions tight. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supply Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Nottinghamshire units are two of five covered by winter contingency contracts negotiated last year by the government to keep coal-fired power plants on standby for emergency use amid heightened concerns over power supplies this winter. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and at Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has also asked two units at Drax in Yorkshire to warm up for potential use. Separately, ESO issued an electricity margin notice, telling the owners of all power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. It later cancelled this requirement. National Grid stressed its measures to bolster supplies did not mean supplies were at risk. However, the ESO stopped short of paying consumers and businesses to turn down their energy use. Earlier on Tuesday, it issued a notice that it may employ its demand flexibility service on Wednesday but later said it would not run. The Grid has been on alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter because of concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock-on effect in Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. A spokesperson for the ESO said that the coal units would offer “additional contingency to operate the network as normal”. In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. Experts expected it to pay high prices to gas-fired plants again on Tuesday. Live ESO data showed gas-fired plants accounted for 54% of Great Britain’s electricity generation, with windfarms contributing 13% and nuclear 10%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-275-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T11:38:32Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 275 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-275-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-275-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 275 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. The UN’s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. Hospital patients are being evacuated from Kherson city because of bombardment by Russian forces, the governor of the region, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. The recently recaptured city in the south of the country faced heavy shelling last night. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said. In a statement following a phone call with President Zelenskiy, she said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European Union governments remained split over at what level to cap Russian oil prices to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has met with a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine for a carefully staged meeting meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. Zelenskiy said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” He also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Seven people were killed and 21 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needs through the winter, during a visit to Ukraine. Cleverly is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine. Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.” The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Half of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, is still without power. Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to take out the country’s power infrastructure. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there would be “no lasting piece” if Russia wins in Ukraine. He said Nato will continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and conservative opposition leaders, aims to serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021. Payam Kia, 35, and his brother Peyman Kia, 42, could face life sentences if found guilty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/01/sizewell-c-nuclear-project-issues-have-been-glossed-over","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-01T17:55:14Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear project issues have been glossed over | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/sizewell-c-nuclear-project-issues-have-been-glossed-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/01/sizewell-c-nuclear-project-issues-have-been-glossed-over","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C nuclear project issues have been glossed over","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three critical issues surrounding the future of the Sizewell C project were missing from the recent announcement (Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station, 27 January). The first is the appalling state of EDF’s finances. This is coupled with shutdowns at its French power stations, using similar technology to Sizewell C. Newer nuclear power stations are not working. The second is that China General Nuclear Power has a 20% stake in Sizewell C. How does the government intend to play its cards here? How much will it pay to ask CGNP to stand down? £100m? The third is that the £100m represents just 0.5% of the total build. It will not be enough to attract any sizeable pension funds. As a consequence, our energy bills would need to go up to provide the £20bn-plus of funding. My estimate is that this would put, over a 25-year period, about £330 a year on our energy bills. And this addition would be on top of price rises due to, say, Russia invading Ukraine or the cap coming off later this year.

Zelenskiy would not say what stage they were at, but to pass on to Putin that his generals were optimistic and in ‘positive mood’. Counterattacking Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 1,400 metres at a number of sections of the front line near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the past day, a Ukraine military spokesperson said on Saturday. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said over the past 48 hours “significant” Ukrainian operations have taken place in several sectors of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have “likely made good progress” and “penetrated the first line of Russian defences”, the MoD added. However, in other areas “Ukrainian progress has been slower”. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine’s forces have continued “unsuccessful” attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. A drone attack by Russian forces killed three people and injured 27 people, including three children, in Ukraine’s Odesa region in the early hours of Saturday, according to Ukraine’s southern command. Emergency services said but the fire had been rapidly put out and 12 people were rescued from the building. The UN’s top aid official Martin Griffiths has warned Ukraine’s humanitarian situation is “hugely worse” after the Kakhova dam rupture. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, landed in Kyiv on Saturday and said Canada will be part of a multinational effort to train Ukrainian fighter pilots. He also announced C$500m ($375m) worth of military aid for Kyiv and said the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was a “direct consequence of Russia’s war”. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Saturday that he planned to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone soon to urge him to withdraw troops from Ukraine. Russian activists and dissidents say Russian authorities in Kherson region are preventing 1,842 left bank residents, including 338 urgent cases around Olekshy, and nearby, from leaving. The figure includes 148 children and 243 elderly people, said the Anti-War Human Rights Coalition. Russia has fired missiles and attack drones at the central Ukrainian region of Poltava overnight, inflicting “some damage of infrastructure and equipment” at the Myrhorod military airfield, according to the regional governor. A £150m fund to help Ukrainians into their own homes has been announced by the UK government. More than 124,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The UK will also provide an extra £16m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iceland’s decision to suspend its embassy operations in Moscow “destroys” bilateral cooperation adding the action would elicit a “corresponding” response. The southern reach of the Dnipro River is likely to return to its banks by 16 June after the breach of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam this week, a Russian-installed official said on Saturday. Vladimir Saldo said the water level at Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had now dropped three metres (10ft) from Tuesday’s peak, Reuters reported. German investigators are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to damage the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September, the Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency says it has put the last operating reactor at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant into a “cold shutdown” as a safety precaution amid flooding from the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about an upcoming mission to broker peace by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine to try and broker peace, Pretoria said on Saturday. The UN has helped boost Russian exports of food and fertilisers, facilitating a steady flow of ships to its ports ahead of an important grain deal deadline.

Its victims were overwhelmingly civilians, in what were the first strikes on the capital since the end of June, hitting buildings, streets, parks and children’s playgrounds. Power supplies in Lviv and Kharkiv were also affected in an attack that brought mass fear not seen since the first six weeks of the war. Little, if any, of what was struck appears to have any direct military significance, and the cynical decision to target Kyiv and other urban centres was clearly political, despite what the Russian president said on Monday morning. “A massive strike was carried out with long-range high-precision air, sea and land-based weapons on Ukraine’s energy, military command and communications facilities,” the Russian president said chillingly. But it should not be forgotten that the wilful or reckless targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure are, simply, war crimes that have left at least 11 dead. Their goal is to strike fear into Ukraine’s leadership and its civilian population, in the hope Kyiv will eventually feel forced to negotiate while Russia still occupies a sixth or more of Ukraine’s land. Ukraine was undeniably anxious on Monday and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will use the fact of the attacks to press for even tougher western sanctions and more missile defence systems at an online G7 meeting on Tuesday lunchtime, which it clearly badly needs. But for all the chaos the attacks have brought, the question will be whether this assault on the cities will endure. Early in September, Kharkiv was targeted by a vicious wave of missile attacks after Ukraine’s battlefield success near the country’s second city, with power and water supplies temporarily knocked out. However, the intensity of the attacks subsequently subsided, and they had no major impact on the battlefield, where Russia continues to lose ground in the northern sector of the front, losing the city of Lyman in the last few days. It is not at all obvious that Russia can maintain an intensification of the missile strikes for an extended period, given how much ammunition it has used in the war so far, and how much internationally political condemnation such attacks will attract. The military reality is also that Russian missile strikes will do nothing to change the balance of power on the ground in the fighting, and whatever fear they provoke, they will not affect Ukraine’s desire to resist, at least in the short term. As it stands, Ukraine is also gaining ground on the way to Kherson in the south as well as in the northern Donbas. The Kremlin knows its current military position is weak, which is why Monday’s attack serves a second purpose, to try to quiet the hardline nationalists who are its principal critics. No wonder, then, that Moscow appears to be trying to bring Belarus closer into the war, with the two countries promising to deploy a joint military taskforce. But Belarus’s army is small, only 11,700 strong plus 6,150 special forces (most of its forces are militia to repress internal dissent). This may mean that the grisly events of Monday have less of a long-term significance than it might appear. But the problem is that, with Russian forces clearly losing ground, Putin’s decision-making is becoming more vicious. Moscow knows it needs to escalate and has already tried recruiting prisoners and forced conscription, with no immediate results. Now it has resorted to a wave of mass urban bombing, and may well do so again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T17:35:06Z","webTitle":"EDF considers extending life of two UK nuclear plants due to energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","fields":{"headline":"EDF considers extending life of two UK nuclear plants due to energy crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"France’s EDF is considering extending the life of two British nuclear power plants due to the severity of the energy crisis. EDF said on Wednesday that it would review whether there was a case to keep open the Hartlepool nuclear power plant in County Durham and Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster. Both plants had been scheduled to close in March 2024. EDF operates all of Britain’s eight nuclear power plants, five of which are still providing power to the grid, about 13% of the UK’s electricity. The entire fleet is due to shut by 2028 apart from Sizewell B, which will close in 2035. When EDF took over the nuclear fleet in 2009, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were due to run until 2014. After technical reviews, that was extended to 2019 and then, in 2016, a further five-year extension was approved after further reviews. Sources said any extra lifespan for the stations was likely to be far shorter than previous extensions. The stations – which produce 2.2 gigawatts of power, enough to power 3.5m homes – have been operational for four decades. EDF said it had decided to launch the review “in light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections” and said an extension would “depend on the results of graphite inspections over the coming months”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked turmoil in energy markets and sent gas and electricity prices soaring. It has also caused an international dash for gas supplies and raised concerns over potential blackouts this winter. The government has moved to shore up winter energy supplies, signing deals to keep coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire and the east Midlands on standby including EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “The government has had no option but to keep these plants on longer term. It underlines that we need a long-term plan for energy generation. We’re a decade late on nuclear and if we don’t move fast enough we will miss the boat on other fuels, like hydrogen. The government needs to give people the confidence to invest.” Some power-generation companies, including those on nuclear, old solar and windfarm contracts have landed an unexpected windfall from the jump in electricity prices while their costs have not risen, triggering calls for a windfall tax. EDF said its nuclear fleet would generate 42 terawatt hours of power in 2022. It said that, because it had sold its output in advance, it had delivered at “well below current wholesale prices”. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Centrica, which owns a 20% stake in the nuclear fleet alongside EDF, wants to renegotiate its electricity-generation contracts. Tom Burke, co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, said: “In the current climate it makes a lot of sense [to extend the plants’ lifespans]. The question is mainly about the cost: is the extra time you’re buying worth the cost of keeping it safe? The Office for Nuclear Regulation are not going to play fast and loose with safety so then it depends on the spend. With electricity prices where they are now it probably does make sense.” EDF said it plans to invest £1bn in the nuclear fleet from 2023 to 2025. The debt-laden company, which is being fully nationalised by the French government, is developing the delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. It is also behind plans for a sister station, Sizewell C, in Suffolk, which was given the green light in the final days of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Getting the most out of our existing nuclear stations is vital to ensuring Britain has a secure supply of power going forward.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Tuesday pledged to launch Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, if elected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T22:33:33Z","webTitle":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","fields":{"headline":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Iran has pledged to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. Restoration of the cameras is among assurances reportedly given to the UN nuclear agency that Tehran will finally assist an investigation into uranium particles found at undeclared sites, it said. The breakthrough came as the watchdog’s director general, Rafael Grossi, who earlier met the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Tehran, returned to Vienna and said that some of the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored. A joint statement from the IAEA and Iran said: “Iran expressed its readiness to … provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues.” The statement did not go into detail on the extent of the assurances but the possibility of improved relations between the UN body and Iran is likely to ward off fresh calls from western countries for Iran to cooperate, diplomats said. Iran has made similar promises before that have yielded little or nothing. The country is supposed to provide access to information, locations and people, Grossi said after returning from Iran before a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors. Iran would also allow reinstallation of extra monitoring equipment that had been put in place under the 2015 nuclear deal, but was removed last year. The visit to Iran came shortly after the IAEA reported that uranium particles enriched up to 83.7% had been found at an underground nuclear site. Fears are growing that Iran has accelerated enrichment but Grossi said the Iranians had agreed to boost inspections at the facility by 50%. He also confirmed the agency’s findings that there has not been any “production or accumulation” of uranium at the higher enrichment level. Nonproliferation experts say Tehran has no civilian use for uranium enriched to even 60%. A stockpile of material enriched to 90%, the level needed for weapons, could quickly be used to produce an atomic bomb, if Iran chooses. The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers limited Tehran’s uranium stockpile and capped enrichment at 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. It also barred nuclear enrichment at Fordo, which was built deep inside a mountain to withstand attacks from the air. The US unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, which then began openly breaching the deal’s restrictions. The IAEA has accused Iran of stonewalling its investigation into traces of processed uranium found at three undeclared sites. Its board of governors censured Iran twice last year for failing to fully cooperate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/29/notebook-taking-the-knees-in-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T16:31:40Z","webTitle":"Taking the knees in Jerusalem | Rachel Cooke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/29/notebook-taking-the-knees-in-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/29/notebook-taking-the-knees-in-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"Taking the knees in Jerusalem","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s probably too soon to suggest, as the Rev Richard Coles recently did, that Elizabeth Bingham’s Kneelers is the best non-fiction book of 2023. But, like him, I’m a little in love with this guide to the most practised (and overlooked) British folk art of the past 90 years. Bingham is an authority on Anglican church canvas-work kneelers, and in her lovely book she traces their history from their beginnings in 1930s Winchester, through their zenith after the coronation of Elizabeth II, to the present day, in which a dedicated few keep the tradition alive. Kneelers celebrate and memorialise every aspect of life, not only the religious – though Bible stories do feature, if you’re in the market for a tapestry of Jonah and the whale – and this makes them both touching and surprising. My favourites so far: a grey whippet (St Peter and St Paul, Deddington); a Second World War ARP warden fighting a fire (St Mary Magdalene, Woodstock); Sizewell nuclear power station in the sunshine (St Edmunds, Southwold). In the 1980s, my mum designed a new set of kneelers for St George’s Cathedral, Jerusalem. They depict the fruits of the Holy Land – dates, figs, pomegranates – and whenever I’m there, I like to check up on them, though this isn’t always straightforward. In 2018, I rocked up for evensong, only to find myself the sole congregant (Christian communities in Jerusalem, increasingly under threat, are ever more depleted). Aargh! I tried to make a dash for it, but I’d already been spotted, and so it was that I joined a priest, a curate, a caretaker and a resident American pilgrim for the service. They were so kind: warm, welcoming, amazed to hear of my mother’s handiwork. But I’m a non-believer, and British to boot. My cheeks burned and my buttocks clenched as I struggled to read a lesson minus my glasses, warbled my way tunelessly through an unfamiliar hymn, and fumbled appallingly the splendid words of the Apostles’ Creed. Theatrical impressions To the National Theatre for The Motive and the Cue, a new play by Jack Thorne about Richard Burton, John Gielgud and the Hamlet they staged on Broadway in 1964. I’m glad to have seen the performances at its heart. Mark Gatiss’s turn as Gielgud and Johnny Flynn’s as Burton are marvellous; Gatiss’s, I think, is touched with greatness. But as the hours ticked by, I grew twitchy. I can’t be the only one who feels that our culture is ever more secondhand; that TV and theatre are increasingly peopled with facsimiles; that impersonation is supplanting character. Imagination has fallen to its knees. Who is writing the Jimmy Porters and the Archie Rices of the future? The Hester Collyers and the Lady Macbeths? Millennium lift off On the subject of making stuff up, I’ve just finished Elizabeth McCracken’s The Hero of This Book, a novel that reads, teasingly, like memoir. Its narrator is a nameless woman who’s walking across London, and, because every geographical detail is accurate, when she stepped into something called the Millennium Inclinator, I rushed to Google. This, surely, was fantasy. To my knowledge, there’s no such thing. But it seems that McCracken, who lives in Texas, did not invent this unlikely sounding portal: a funicular by any other name. Though she might as well have done, for I’ll never ride on it now. The Millennium Inclinator was an inclined lift (effectively, a tiny cable-hauled railway) that enabled pedestrians to climb from the north bank of the Thames to the Millennium Bridge above without using the stairs. It opened in 2003, was refurbished in 2012, and closed forever in 2021. • Rachel Cooke is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s where things stand: Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Saturday, her first since Russia’s invasion in February as Kyiv urges Berlin to send it battle tanks. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa, the German defence ministry said, without saying how long the trip had lasted. It added on Twitter that she had met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure. “The water pressure has more or less closed the pipeline so that the gas which is inside can’t go out,” Nord Stream 2 spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said fighting was continuing in the key town of Lyman, which Russia said earlier in the day its troops had abandoned to avoid being trapped. “The Ukrainian flag is already in Lyman in the Donetsk region. Fighting is still going on there,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are currently around 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Yuliya Kovaliv, Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada, said her country holds Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement that set out core principles for global aviation. “It is important that all the ICAO members addressed such a drastic breach of the Chicago Convention,” she told Reuters. After Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the United Nation’s aviation agency’s governing council, the French representative told the assembly: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on ICAO’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”. Other members include the G7 countries, China, Brazil and Australia. Liz Truss has said a series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. In a joint report delivered to the United Nations last week, the Danish and Swedish governments have claimed that the leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which can carry gas to Germany, were caused by blasts equivalent to the power of “several hundred kilograms of explosive.” Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia’s region of Chechnya, said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after a major new defeat on the battlefield. In a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, Kadyrov wrote: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Saturday, her first since Russia’s invasion in February as Kyiv urges Berlin to send it battle tanks, Agence France-Presse reports. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa, the German defence ministry said in a statement, without saying how long the trip had lasted. It added on Twitter that she had met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov. So far, no Nato country has supplied western battle tanks to Kyiv, despite Ukraine repeatedly asking for Germany to supply it with Leopard battle tanks to assist in its counter-attack against Russia. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he doesn’t want to go it alone on arms supplies and will only take decisions in consultation with his western allies. Berlin has instead struck deals with third countries, which transfer heavy weapons to Ukraine – in exchange for receiving supplies from Germany. Lambrecht’s visit came a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, declared the annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. These annexations have been unanimously condemned by Ukraine’s allies. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure, Agence France-Presse reports. “The water pressure has more or less closed the pipeline so that the gas which is inside can’t go out,” Nord Stream 2 spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. “The conclusion is that there is still gas in the pipeline,” he added. When asked how much gas was believed to be in the pipeline, Lissek said: “That is the one-million-dollar question.” Information on the status of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline leak, which was significantly larger, was not immediately available. While the pipelines are not currently in operation, they both still contained gas before they fell victim to apparent sabotage, producing four leaks. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday said fighting was continuing in the key town of Lyman, which Russia said earlier in the day its troops had abandoned to avoid being trapped. “The Ukrainian flag is already in Lyman in the Donetsk region. Fighting is still going on there,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. On Russia’s failure to win enough votes for re-election to the United Nations’ aviation agency’s governing council, Yuliya Kovaliv, Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada, said her country holds Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement that set out core principles for global aviation. “It is important that all the ICAO members addressed such a drastic breach of the Chicago Convention,” she told Reuters. It took Alina three goes at the local conscription centre to get her husband out of Russia’s war in Ukraine. She knew the local officials managing the mobilisation in her town south of Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, she said. So when her husband, who has health problems because of his weight and served in the army more than 15 years ago, was called up, she began hassling them to review his case. “I told them: ‘What war?’ Have they gone crazy?’ And the top [official] just gave me this sad look,” she said. But as protests broke out last week in Dagestan and anger grew over the conscription, she said, something changed. Suddenly, they told her that her husband’s call-up was a mistake. After Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the United Nation’s aviation agency’s governing council, the French representative told the assembly: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia, along with the G7, China, Brazil and Australia, held spots as “states of chief importance in air transport” on ICAO’s 36-member council. “We’d like to express regret regarding the outcome of the voting,” the Russian representative said. “We view this as a purely political step and has nothing to do with Russia’s position in the field of civil aviation.” Russia closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries, including all 27 members of the European Union, in response to Ukraine-related sanctions targeting its aviation sector following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has thanked the US for its latest assistance package. Here is some more background on Ramzan Kadyrov’s comments that Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after a major new defeat on the battlefield. Russia has the world’s largest atomic arsenal, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons that are designed to be deployed against opposing armies. Other top Putin allies, including former president Dmitry Medvedev, have suggested that Russia may need to resort to nuclear weapons, but Kadyrov’s call was the most urgent and explicit, Reuters reports. The influential ruler of the Caucasus region of Chechnya has been a vocal champion of the war in Ukraine, with Chechen forces forming part of the vanguard of the Russian army there. Kadyrov is widely believed to be personally close to Putin, who appointed him to govern restive Chechnya in 2007. In his message, Kadyrov described Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, commander of the Russian forces fighting at Lyman, as a “mediocrity”, and suggested that he should be demoted to private and stripped of his medals. “Due to a lack of elementary military logistics, today we have abandoned several settlements and a large piece of territory,” he said. Kadyrov said that two weeks before he had raised the possibility of a defeat at Lyman with Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s general staff, but that Gerasimov had dismissed the idea. Liz Truss has said a series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. In a joint report delivered to the United Nations last week, the Danish and Swedish governments have claimed that the leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which can carry gas to Germany, were caused by blasts equivalent to the power of “several hundred kilograms of explosive”. The UK prime minister was updated on developments in the situation unfolding in the Baltic Sea as she engaged in talks with her Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, in Downing Street on Saturday. Suspicions have been rising in western capitals that the explosions on the pipelines were attacks carried out by Russia as a means of intensifying pressure in western governments over energy supplies. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has dismissed any such claims and said in a speech on Friday that “Anglo Saxons” were responsible. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia’s region of Chechnya, said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after a major new defeat on the battlefield. In a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, Kadyrov wrote: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons”. Kadyrov was speaking a day after President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions - including Donetsk, where Lyman is located - and placed them under Russia’s nuclear umbrella, saying Moscow would defend the lands it had seized “with all our strength and all our means”, Reuters reports. It’s 6pm in Ukraine. Here’s the latest: Russian troops pulled out of the town of the strategic city of Lyman in eastern Ukraine “due to the risk to be encircled” and moved to “more advantageous frontiers” Russia’s ministry of defence said via Telegram on Saturday. The retreat comes a day after Vladimir Putin signed “accession treaties” formalising Russia’s illegal annexation of four occupied regions in Ukraine. The IOC president Thomas Bach has been accused of violating the game’s principles by suggesting that Russian athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera “This war has not been started by the Russian athletes”. Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from Europe’s largest nuclear plant to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Kharkiv Oblast governor Oleh Syniehubov said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. He believed they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company said. Speaking with BBC News on Saturday, Petro Kotin said “they are trying to make our personnel just to sign the accurate deals for the work at Rosatom”. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she shared key information on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines with Liz Truss at a meeting in Downing Street. “This is sabotage and it is critical infrastructure. So of course, this is a very serious situation,” told reporters outside No 10. The Ministry of Defence said Russia’s expansion strategy has resulted in “killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens”.The MoD said Russia is expending “strategically valuable military assets” in attempts to gain tactical advantage. Turkey which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, rejected Russia’s annexation of Ukraine, calling the decision a “grave violation” of international law. Russia has not been re-elected to the UN aviation agency’s governing council, in a boost for western powers that wanted to hold Moscow accountable for its invasion of Ukraine. On Saturday, Russia did not receive enough votes to remain in the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s 36-nation governing council, during the agency’s assembly which runs through to 7 October in Montreal, Reuters reports. Poppy Khoza, the assembly’s president and South Africa’s director general of civil aviation, called the circumstance “unprecedented”. Vladimir Putin faced severe embarrassment when Ukrainian soldiers liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, raising the blue-and-yellow national flag above its entrance sign, hours after Russia’s president announced that the area was Moscow’s “for ever”. Ukraine’s armed forces said they had entirely surrounded the city, trapping thousands of Russian soldiers inside. The governor of the Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, said the besieged troops had begged on Friday to be allowed to leave Lyman. Their commanders refused, he claimed. Read more here: Russian troops have pulled out of the town of the strategic city of Lyman in eastern Ukraine “due to the risk to be encircled” and moved to “more advantageous frontiers”, Russia’s ministry of defence said via Telegram on Saturday. Ukraine forces encircled Russian forces in the eastern town earlier on Saturday where Russia’s forces at Lyman totalled about 5,000 to 5,500 soldiers. Ukrainian soldiers were later seen raising the nation’s flag before the entrance sign to the city. The retreat comes a day after Vladimir Putin signed “accession treaties” formalising Russia’s illegal annexation of four occupied regions in Ukraine, marking the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war. Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces, previously said: Lyman is important because it is the next step towards the liberation of the Ukrainian Donbas. It is an opportunity to go further to Kreminna and Sievierodonetsk, and it is psychologically very important. Russia’s Gazprom has suspended gas deliveries to Italy’s Eni, blaming a transport problem in Austria, AFP reports. The Italian energy giant said on Saturday: Gazprom told us that it was not able to confirm the delivery of the volumes demanded for today, citing the impossibility of gas transport through Austria. Russian gas flows to Eni via the Tarvisio entry point will be naught. Before the war in Ukraine, nearly 45% of Italy’s imported gas came from Russia. Most of the gas from Russia to Italy passes through Ukraine via the Trans Austria Gas Pipeline. Ukraine’s state security service shared a video on Twitter on Saturday showing the “scene of a war crime by Russian troops” with damaged cars and charred human remains. Russian troops recently shot a civilian column between occupied Svatov in Luhansk region and liberated Kupyansk in Kharkiv region, they said. Warning: this video contains graphic images. The IOC president Thomas Bach has been accused of violating the Games’ principles by suggesting that its athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: It is not about necessarily having Russia back. It’s about having athletes with a Russian passport who do not support the war back in competition … This war has not been started by the Russian athletes. Russia has been barred from competing under its flag or playing its national anthem at successive Games as punishment for widespread doping violations. Russian news agencies quoted Russian sports minister Oleg Matytsin as responding: The main task of the international Olympic movement is to provide athletes with equal access to participation in the Olympic Games, regardless of their views and religions, traditions and citizenship. Bach’s latest statement goes against Olympic principles. Russian authorities have informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the head of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning, Reuters reports. Earlier, we reported that the UN nuclear watchdog was seeking clarification from Russian authorities after Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from Europe’s largest nuclear plant to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said his detention “jeopardises the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant”. Here are the latest photos from Ukraine and elsewhere: The Kyiv Independent reports that Kharkiv Oblast governor Oleh Syniehubov has said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. Syniehubov believes they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers. Ukrainian news website Suspilne reports that there were six cars in the convoy which were found covered in bullet holes and burned out. According to Suspilne, a child was among the dead. Syniehubov described the massacre as “cruelty that has no justification”. Russian-installed officials in Ukraine’s east accused Ukraine of shelling a convoy of refugees being evacuated from the Kharkiv region and killing around 30 civilians, as reported by Russian state media on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if they were referring to the same convoy. Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, has shared a video which appears to show Ukrainian soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag at the entrance to the city of Lyman, in the Donetsk region which has been occupied by Russian soldiers since May, the Kyiv Independent reports. Reuters reports that Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesman of Ukraine’s Operational Command East, said that Lyman is an important step towards the “liberation” of the region of Donbas. It’s 3pm in Ukraine, here’s the latest: Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company said. Speaking with BBC News on Saturday, Petro Kotin said “they are trying to make our personnel just to sign the accurate deals for the work at Rosatom”. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she shared key information on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines with Liz Truss at a meeting in Downing Street. “This is sabotage and it is critical infrastructure. So of course, this is a very serious situation,” told reporters outside No 10. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has requested clarifications from Russian authorities following reports that the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been detained. Ukraine has encircled Russia’s forces around a bastion that is critical for Moscow at the eastern town of Lyman, in an operation that is still under way. Russia’s forces at Lyman totalled about 5,000 to 5,500 soldiers, but the number of encircled troops may have fallen because of casualties and some soldiers trying to break out of the encirclement, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces. The Ministry of Defence said Russia’s expansion strategy has resulted in “killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens”.The MoD said Russia is expending “strategically valuable military assets” in attempts to gain tactical advantage. The Ukrainian director-general of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been detained by a Russian patrol, according to Energoatom. The company said his detention on Friday “jeopardises the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.” Turkey which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, rejected Russia’s annexation of Ukraine, calling the decision a “grave violation” of international law. A key adviser to Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy, Mykhailo Podolyak, said “negotiations are possible” but “with the new president of Russia”. Tweeting on Saturday, Podolyak said there is no point in negotiating with those who “dance on bones” – referring to Putin and other officials. A superyacht linked to sanctioned Russian billionaire Igor Kesaev is for sale for €29.5m (about £26m). A US-based luxury yacht broker is advertising the 168-ft MySky yacht, according to an email seen by Reuters from the brokerage firm to undisclosed recipients on 14 September. Kesaev was sanctioned in April by the UK and EU following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the EU citing his involvement in military weapons production in Russia, as well as links to the Russian government “and its security forces”. The United States has not sanctioned Kesaev, and the US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment, Reuters reports. Sara Gioanola, a spokesperson for Heesen Yachts, the Netherlands-based firm that built MySky, confirmed that Kesaev commissioned it and another yacht, called Sky. Reuters was unable to confirm independently that Kesaev still has direct ownership in MySky. On Friday Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that Ukraine was officially applying for membership of Nato, hours after Vladimir Putin said in a Kremlin ceremony that he was annexing four Ukrainian provinces. In a speech filmed outside his presidential office in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he was taking this “decisive step” in order to protect “the entire community” of Ukrainians. He promised that the application would happen in an “expedited manner”. Speaking with BBC News on Saturday, Petro Kotin said “they are trying to make our personnel just to sign the accurate deals for the work at Rosatom”. His remarks come after reports that the Ukrainian director-general of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ihor Murashov, had been detained by a Russian patrol on Friday afternoon. Citing previous attempts, Kotin added: We expect that they’re trying to make him accept this move from Russians to catch the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Rosatom. Kotin also described Murashov as the main person responsible for the plant’s safety, which is currently operated by 7,000 people on site. Here’s a video of Ukraine’s armed forces raising the nation’s flag before the entrance sign to the city of Lyman, where Ukraine said it encircled thousands of Russian troops earlier today. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she shared key information on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines with Liz Truss at a meeting in Downing Street. Following the meeting, outside No 10, Frederiksen told PA news: Of course, it has been very important for me to underline that the Danish authorities have said that this this is not an accident. This is sabotage and it is critical infrastructure. So of course, this is a very serious situation. Both Britain and Denmark have reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, following Vladimir Putin’s annexation of four regions on Friday. We talked most of all about the situation in Ukraine and the so-called referendums in Ukraine. As you know, Britain and Denmark are very supportive of Ukraine and we will continue to be so and to continue our work and our co-operation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has requested clarifications from Russian authorities following reports that the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been detained. A spokesperson for the IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, told Reuters: We have contacted Russian authorities and are requesting clarifications. Earlier, we reported that Ihor Murashov had been detained on his way from Europe’s largest nuclear plant to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said his detention “jeopardises the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant”. Here are the latest photos from Ukraine and elsewhere: It’s 12pm in Ukraine, here’s the latest: Ukraine has encircled Russia’s forces around a bastion that is critical for Moscow at the eastern town of Lyman, in an operation that is still under way. Russia’s forces at Lyman totalled about 5,000 to 5,500 soldiers, but the number of encircled troops may have fallen because of casualties and some soldiers trying to break out of the encirclement, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces. The Ministry of Defence said Russia’s expansion strategy has resulted in “killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens”.The MoD said Russia is expending “strategically valuable military assets” in attempts to gain tactical advantage. Ukraine’s president thanked his US counterpart, Joe Biden, on Saturday for signing an additional $12.35 bn (£11bn) in support for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “This help is more important today than ever.” The Ukrainian director-general of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been detained by a Russian patrol, according to Energoatom. The company said his detention on Friday “jeopardises the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.” Turkey which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, rejected Russia’s annexation of Ukraine, calling the decision a “grave violation” of international law. The World Bank said it will provide an additional US$530m in support to Ukraine, bringing the total aid by the bank to $13bn. The aid is supported by the UK ($500m) and Denmark ($30m). Ukraine has encircled Russia’s forces around a bastion that is critical for Moscow at the eastern town of Lyman, in an operation that is still under way, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said on Saturday. Russia’s forces at Lyman totalled about 5,000 to 5,500 soldiers, but the number of encircled troops may have fallen because of casualties and some soldiers trying to break out of the encirclement, said Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces, according to Reuters. Cherevatyi said: Lyman is important because it is the next step towards the liberation of the Ukrainian Donbas. It is an opportunity to go further to Kreminna and Sievierodonetsk, and it is psychologically very important. On Saturday, Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said via Telegram: The occupiers trapped in Liman asked the Russian command to allow them to leave the city, but were refused. He added: “The possibilities of delivering ammunition to the Russians to the surrounded city or a peaceful exit from the settlement are already blocked.” The Ministry of Defence said Russia’s expansion strategy has resulted in “killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens”. The latest intelligence update, published on Saturday morning, comes after Putin signed annexation agreements across four occupied regions in Ukraine, marking the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war. The MoD said Russia is expending “strategically valuable military assets” in attempts to gain tactical advantage. It added that Russia “almost certainly” struck a convoy outside the town of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, where local media reported 25 civilians had been killed, and more than 50 injured. Ukraine’s president thanked his US counterpart, Joe Biden, on Saturday for signing an additional $12.35 bn (£11bn) in support for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter: The law provides the financing of defence programs, as well as powerful direct budget support to Ukraine. This help is more important today than ever. Here are the latest photos from Ukraine and elsewhere: The Ukrainian director-general of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was detained by a Russian patrol, according to Energoatom, the Ukrainian state agency in charge of the plant. In a statement on Saturday, the company said Ihor Murashov had been detained on his way from Europe’s largest nuclear plant to the town of Enerhodar around 4pm on Friday, Reuters reports. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, wrote on Telegram: He was taken out of the car, and with his eyes blindfolded he was driven in an unknown direction. With no immediate word on Murashov’s fate, Kotin added: His detention by the Russians jeopardises the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) faced calls for a demilitarised zone around the plant last month from the United Nations after Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for shelling at the site that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines. Turkey has rejected Russia’s annexation of Ukraine on Saturday, calling the decision a “grave violation” of international law. Turkey, which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, said it had not recognised Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, adding that it rejected Russia’s decision to annex Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports. This decision, which constitutes a grave violation of the established principles of international law, cannot be accepted. We reiterate our support to the resolution of this war, the severity of which keeps growing, based on a just peace that will be reached through negotiations. The World Bank has said it will provide an additional US$530m in support to Ukraine, bringing the total aid by the bank to $13bn. The aid is supported by the UK ($500m) and Denmark ($30m), the World Bank said. Of the total aid of $13bn to Ukraine to date, $11bn had been fully disbursed, the bank added. The World Bank’s most recent analysis put the total long-term cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine over the next three years at well over $100bn, said Arup Banerji, World Bank regional country director for eastern Europe. Overnight, Ukrainian forces were reportedly on the doorstep of Lyman in Donetsk, which Moscow’s forces pummelled for weeks to capture this summer. “Lyman is partially surrounded,” said Denis Pushilin, the pro-Moscow leader in Donetsk, adding later on social media that Russian forces were holding out “with the last of their strength”. Reports have circulated online of the Ukrainians also reaching Kreminna, 30km further east of Lyman. Hopefully we’ll have more on Ukrainian troops’ advances as the day progresses. Hello and thanks for joining today’s live coverage of the Russian war against Ukraine, brought to you by the Guardian. I’m Warren Murray here to get things started. Let’s begin with some of the most recent developments. Russian forces were potentially on the verge of one of their worst defeats of the war after Ukrainian troops recaptured two villages close to the eastern Russian-occupied stronghold of Lyman. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, proclaimed the annexation of territory seized in his invasion in four regions amounting to 15% of total Ukrainian territory while Kyiv said it would continue its fight to retake the illegally occupied land. Before signing the documents which lay claim to Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – an act denounced as illegal by Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the head of the United Nations – Putin delivered a 37-minute anti-western diatribe. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was formally applying for Ukraine to join the Nato military alliance, adding that Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow but not while Putin remained president. Russia vetoed a UN security council resolution introduced by the US and Albania condemning Moscow’s proclaimed annexations. Russia’s strategic partner China abstained from the vote, as well as India, which has historic defense ties with Russia despite a warming relationship with the United States. The United States responded to the annexations by imposing more sanctions on Russia, targeting hundreds of people and companies, including those in Russia’s military-industrial complex and lawmakers. At least 30 civilians were killed and almost 100 wounded in what Kyiv said was a cynical Russian missile strike on a convoy of civilian cars in southern Ukraine. Putin, without providing evidence, blamed the US and its allies for blowing up pipelines under the Baltic Sea, raising the temperature in a crisis that has left Europe racing to secure its energy infrastructure and supplies. Joe Biden, the US president, said “was a deliberate act of sabotage and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies”, adding that Washington and its allies would send divers to find out what happened. The ruptures on the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline system have led to what is likely the biggest single release of climate-damaging methane recorded, the United Nations Environment Programme said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/sep/16/what-are-nuclear-powered-submarines-anyway-a-guide-to-australias-looming-military-addition","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-16T06:53:11Z","webTitle":"What are nuclear-powered submarines, anyway?

A guide to Australia’s looming military addition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Thursday morning that Australia would be ripping up its multi-billion dollar contract with the French shipbuilder Naval Group and sign a new deal with the US and UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The surprise decision announced this morning means Australia will become only the second country (after the UK) to receive the technology from the US. Naturally, the reaction to Thursday’s news has been divided, and while there are many questions remaining, here is an introductory guide to the basics of nuclear-powered submarines. What are they and what design might Australia get? It is not clear which submarine the Australian government will obtain, but the US navy’s latest design is the Virginia-class submarine. Manufactured by American aerospace and defence company General Dynamics, this submarine has gone through several iterations but is generally powered by a single nuclear reactor and can travel at more than 25 knots. Its crew includes 15 officers and 117 enlisted personnel, and the subs are used both in anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering operations. The vessel is powered by a 210MW pressurised water nuclear reactor, inside of which the enriched uranium fuel is sealed. The reactor does not have to be refuelled over its 30-year lifespan. How do they work? The submarines are powered by onboard nuclear reactors. These produce energy by splitting atoms to create heat, which is then used to make steam for turbines that generate electricity to power propulsion and its internal systems. To create the steam, the sub draws in seawater and purifies it through a desalination process. Some of this clean water is also used for drinking, the creation of oxygen through hydrolysis and for scrubbing CO2 or other contaminants from the air. What are the advantages of nuclear? Diesel-powered submarines, the kind that Australia was initially going to build in partnership with French company Naval Group, tend to be smaller and run more quietly. They can easily slip into shallow waters along coasts or in river estuaries where they are harder to detect. While this has certain advantages, the main drawback is endurance. Diesel-powered submarines need to resurface regularly in order to take on oxygen, vent exhaust and charge their batteries. As a result, they can’t operate in the open ocean for long periods and careful thought needs to be given about where, when and how they can refuel. Nuclear submarines, on the other hand, are built for endurance. With abundant power, some builds can run almost indefinitely, or at least until something breaks down or the crew runs out of tinned food. The only real limitations are the needs of the crew, who can only last so long in a confined space. What are the drawbacks of nuclear? Because nuclear submarines tend to be larger, one downside is they can’t move into shallow waters, making them more easily detectable. During one war game in 2015, a Russian-built, Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine used by the Indian navy “sank” a US nuclear-powered sub – although the US navy has never acknowledged the sinking. Traditionally Australia’s diesel-powered submarines are thought to have been complementary to US powered nuclear subs used by the US, making the recent announcement a surprise. Nuclear submarines are also more complicated to maintain and service. Unlike the US and UK, Australia does not have a domestic nuclear power industry, which could provide a highly skilled workforce of engineers and nuclear physicists. Much of the work on the subs will probably have to be done overseas. It is also not clear what plans are being made to handle the spent uranium. The Australian government has been working to build a controversial nuclear waste storage facility in Kimba in South Australia, but this proposal has so far been limited to low-level and intermediate waste from 100 sites around the country. Are nuclear subs quieter? It depends. Diesel-electric subs are quieter while running in electric mode, but must at some point surface or pop up a snorkel to run their diesel engines and recharge the batteries. When the diesel engines are running, these noisier than nuclear-powered subs. Nuclear subs also generate noise from the reactor, including the coolant pipes, turbines and steam generation. What fuel do they use? The US Virginia-class submarines typically use highly enriched uranium (HEU) that does not need replacing during the lifecycle of each submarine. Across the world, the US, Britain, Russia and India are the only countries to use HEU in naval reactors. Other countries like France use high-density, low-enriched uranium that will occasionally require swapping out with a replacement source. HEU is one of the most dangerous metals on earth and also one of the simplest nuclear materials to work with. These twin traits also make it a security risk over fears rogue states or terrorists might develop a nuclear weapon, or mishaps trigger a serious accident. It is also why it has been targeted under non-proliferation treaties to reduce its use. Will it be able to launch nukes? If there is one thing the Australian government has been very clear about, it’s that the subs will not be armed with nuclear weapons and that Australia is not seeking to obtain nuclear weapons capability. That’s not to say the submarine won’t be capable of doing so. Using the Virginia-class as an example, the build comes equipped with 12 vertical missile launch tubes and four 533mm torpedo tubes. It is capable of launching 16 Tomahawk cruise missiles in one salvo but can be modified to mount heavier weapons systems. While these missiles could potentially be built to carry a nuclear warhead, as of 2019 the only variations of the Tomahawk missile in operation were non-nuclear. What happens when things go wrong? Serving on a naval submarine has not always been a pleasant experience. For example, German U-boat crews in the second world war suffered devastating losses and many were killed not just in combat but from catastrophic mechanical failures, including asphyxiation from diesel exhaust or explosive decompression after flushing a toilet. When it comes to nuclear subs, radiation adds a new dimension, although there have been no known reactor meltdowns in the sinkings that have occurred to date. The most recent nuclear sub disaster involved the Russian Kursk, which sank after a faulty weld on a torpedo caused an explosion that then detonated other torpedos. All of the 118 crew members died. Many were instantly killed in the initial blasts, although failsafes in the nuclear reactor shut it down without incident. The 23 sailors who survived the blasts spent six hours awaiting a rescue that did not come, and were killed in a desperate attempt to create oxygen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/nov/17/6bn-insulate-houses-sizewell-c-jeremy-hunt-energy-efficiency-autumn-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T18:20:54Z","webTitle":"Government plans £6bn to insulate UK’s houses and gives go-ahead for Sizewell C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/6bn-insulate-houses-sizewell-c-jeremy-hunt-energy-efficiency-autumn-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/6bn-insulate-houses-sizewell-c-jeremy-hunt-energy-efficiency-autumn-statement","fields":{"headline":"Government plans £6bn to insulate UK houses and gives go-ahead for Sizewell C","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has pledged a further £6bn to improve Britain’s leaky housing stock and pushed the button on the Sizewell C nuclear power station project. In his autumn statement, the chancellor announced that a taskforce would oversee an initiative to insulate homes and upgrade boilers, and would receive extra funding between 2025 and 2028. He said £6.6bn would be spent during this parliament on energy efficiency, and announced a further £6bn of funding from 2025, “doubling annual investment”. Hunt said cutting energy bills would ease the cost of living crisis, and set a target to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and industry by 15%. “Over the long term, there is only one way to stop ourselves being at the mercy of international gas prices: energy independence combined with energy efficiency,” he said. Hunt confirmed that Sizewell C in Suffolk would be “the first state-backed nuclear power station for 30 years” after a £700m investment. Boris Johnson gave the £30bn project the green light in one of his last acts as prime minister but Hunt’s move to cut spending had created uncertainty around the planned power plant’s future. Hunt said contracts would be signed in “coming weeks” with partners in the project, including the French state energy firm EDF, which is building Sizewell’s sister station at Hinkley Point C, which is delayed and over budget. He said the station would provide power for 6m homes for 50 years. However, critics argue that it will take years to build and push up bills. The Nuclear Industry Association said the decision “represents the biggest step in our journey to energy independence”. But the Stop Sizewell C campaign said it “loads more tax on to struggling households, who would be forced to pay a nuclear levy on bills for a decade before they could light a single lightbulb”. Campaigners have long demanded that the government launch a concerted drive to improve home energy efficiency, arguing it would be the simplest way to cut bills and reduce household emissions. The government has made attempts to improve household energy efficiency over the past decade. The Green Deal offered loans for consumers to install double glazing and insulation but was seen as complex and did not receive widespread take-up. Last year, Boris Johnson cut the green homes grant, citing lack of consumer interest. In September, the government extended the existing energy company obligation scheme, under which they are expected to spend £5bn between 2022 and 2026. The scheme aims to install insulation and upgrade heating systems for low-income households. The Energy Saving Trust has said that installing 270mm of insulation, in a home with none, can cost between £455 and £640, depending on whether it is terraced, detached or a bungalow. Labour had called for the government to make insulating homes a “national mission” that could save people £11bn in three years. Angela Terry, the chief executive of the climate change action group One Home, said: “The news that the government is planning to set up an energy efficiency taskforce is welcome but they have to work with speed as temperatures drop this winter. “Insulating our homes is the single-most important step we can take to reduce our energy bills, bring down inflation and tackle the climate crisis.” Jess Ralston, a senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “For those struggling through this winter and the next, investment in insulation in 2025 is two years too late.” The chancellor also said the energy price guarantee would be kept for a further 12 months at an average of £3,000 for a typical household, up from £2,500 at present. Analysts said the move would cost about £6bn. Hunt said there would also be further payments for help with energy bills for pensioners, for poorer households and for disabled people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/dec/14/israel-warns-diplomacy-proving-fruitless-in-iran-nuclear-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-14T20:36:05Z","webTitle":"Israel warns diplomacy proving fruitless in Iran nuclear talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/14/israel-warns-diplomacy-proving-fruitless-in-iran-nuclear-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/14/israel-warns-diplomacy-proving-fruitless-in-iran-nuclear-talks","fields":{"headline":"Israel warns diplomacy proving fruitless in Iran nuclear talks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tehran’s approach to talks on its nuclear programme in Vienna has become so uncompromising according to Israel’s lead diplomat on Iran, Joshua Zarka, that they “have reached the last stretch of diplomacy”. Israeli officials said they were hopeful that the US and European nations would agree to put an emergency motion to the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stating that Iran was in breach of its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and the 2015 nuclear deal. Such a motion, planned for this month, would be the start of a wider process to try to force Iran to change its behaviour on the nuclear question. Israel has long sought to push its allies away from negotiations with its arch-enemy, saying such talks could be fruitless and that Iran would still seek to covertly advance its weapons programme unless forced to abandon it. Zarka was speaking as the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said advances made by Iran since the 2015 nuclear deal’s collapse meant there would have to be changes to the original agreement. “The reality is that we are dealing with a very different Iran,” he said. “2022 is so different from 2015 that there will have to be adjustments that take into consideration these new realities so our inspectors can inspect whatever the countries agree at the political table. “There’s no other country other than those making nuclear weapons reaching those high levels” of uranium enrichment, Grossi said of Iran. “I’ve said many times that this doesn’t mean that Iran has a nuclear weapon. But it does mean that this level of enrichment is one that requires an intense verification effort.” Grossi said the restrictions faced by his inspectors in Iran threatened to give the world only a “very blurred image” of Tehran’s programme. “If the international community through us, through the IAEA, is not seeing clearly how many centrifuges or what is the capacity that they may have … what you have is a very blurred image,” he said. “It will give you the illusion of the real image. But not the real image. This is why this is so important.” Russia in particular has, according to Israeli officials, been pressing Iran to allow UN inspectors to operate more freely, and the first crunch point may come before the end of this month at the IAEA board if Grossi declares the inspectors have still not been given the access they need. Zarka said he would not be drawn on the military options available to Israel, which he was not responsible for. But Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. Israel believes it is winning the argument with British and US officials that the new Iranian regime – elected in June and answerable to the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei – has decided it does not need to go back to the joint comprehensive plan of action agreed in 2015, but will instead try to buy time to build its nuclear capabilities. The accumulation of steps taken by Iran means, Israel believes, that the country is weeks away from the point when it will have uranium enriched up to 90%, a position described as the break-out moment in the 2015 nuclear deal. Israel has never admitted to its role in the previous strikes on Iran, including the assassination of the head of Iran’s nuclear programme, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. The Iranian ambassador to London, Mohsen Baharvand, told a briefing last week it was reasonable for Iran to ask for guarantees, along the lines of an international treaty, that the US would remain in the agreement permanently, and not walk out – as Donald Trump did, with Israel’s support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-staff-under-russian-orders","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T19:04:24Z","webTitle":"‘Grave concern’ as Ukraine Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under Russian orders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-staff-under-russian-orders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-staff-under-russian-orders","fields":{"headline":"‘Grave concern’ as Ukraine Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under Russian orders","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Staff at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are being told what to do by the Russian military commander who seized the site last week, in violation of international safety protocols. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed “grave concern” at the situation at the six-reactor plant, the largest in Europe. The agency was told by the Ukrainian nuclear regulator that “any action of plant management – including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units – requires prior approval by the Russian commander”. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Sunday that the Russian military command over the nuclear plant “contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security” which states that the operating staff must be able to carry out their safety and security duties and be able to make decisions “free of undue pressure”. Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday morning, damaging a walkway between two of the six reactors, and starting a fire in a nearby building used for training. As a result some of the reactors were shut down and others were put on low power. The reactors themselves are well protected by a thick concrete shell, but there is concern that more vulnerable spent fuel rods could be hit, or that the power and cooling systems could be affected, potentially triggering a meltdown. The IAEA also expressed concern that the Russian occupying force had reportedly shut down mobile phone networks and the internet connection “so that reliable information from the site cannot be obtained through the normal channels of communication”. It said communications between the plant and the Ukrainian nuclear regulator have been affected, which the IAEA said contravenes another of the nuclear safety pillars listed by Grossi, requiring “reliable communications with the regulator and others”. “In order to be able to operate the plant safely and securely, management and staff must be allowed to carry out their vital duties in stable conditions without undue external interference or pressure,” Grossi said. “The deteriorating situation regarding vital communications between the regulator and the Zaporizhzhia [nuclear plant] is also a source of deep concern, especially during an armed conflict that may jeopardize the country’s nuclear facilities at any time,” he added. “Reliable communications between the regulator and the operator are a critical part of overall nuclear safety and security.” The IAEA said that the operators at the plant were now being able to rotate between three shifts, relieving the operators who had been on duty at the time the plant was seized, but there were still “problems with availability and supply of food” which the Ukrainian regulator said was affecting morale on the plant. The IAEA also expressed alarm that communication had been lost with institutions and enterprises in the besieged port city of Mariupol where it said there were “category 1-3 radiation sources, a probable reference to medical or industrial isotopes. A category 1 source can be lethal after more than a few minutes exposure. “Such radioactive material can cause serious harm to people if not secured and managed properly,” the agency said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/29/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-187-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T00:34:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 187 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/29/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-187-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/29/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-187-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 187 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a secret meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said. The meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, local officials said on Sunday. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia and the town of Orikhiv farther east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. The Energoatom head, Petro Kotin, told the Guardian a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Russia did so in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” said a US state department statement. Concern about the potential risk of radiation leaks at the plant persists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities issued fresh warnings about the risk of radioactive leaks, after shelling that the sides blamed on each other. Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances”. Russia has ignored widespread international calls for the area to be demilitarised. Ukrainians are likely to experience their coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17-18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. Germany is replenishing its gas stocks more quickly than expected despite drastic Russian supply cuts and should meet an October target early, the government has said. Europe’s largest economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has raced to bolster its reserves before winter, crediting energy-saving measures in recent weeks and massive purchases of gas from other suppliers. EU foreign ministers are expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation next week. The EU move falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban would lack the necessary support. “I don’t think that to cut the relationship with the Russian civilian population will help and I don’t think that this idea will have the required unanimity,” he told Austria’s ORF TV on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T18:40:30Z","webTitle":"Nuclear option is not the best for energy transition away from Russian fuels | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear option is not the best for energy transition away from Russian fuels","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Agreed, Russian gas bad – but George Monbiot’s attack on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, seems deeply misplaced (It’s not too late to free ourselves from this idiotic addiction to Russian gas, 9 March). The German energy transition is all about replacing conventional power plants, fissile as well as fossil fuel, with renewables. Looking at both short- and mid-term energy scenarios, Germany decided that the costs and risks of keeping nuclear outweighed the limited benefits. Meanwhile, worldwide, renewables are exponentially ramping up, and nuclear declining. Global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to increase by over 60% between 2020 and 2026, reaching more than 4,800GW. This is equivalent to the current global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. And here’s the killer: Russia produces about 35% of the world’s enriched uranium for nuclear reactors, and the EU’s uranium imports from Russia equal those from Niger, at 2,545 tonnes. The Fukushima disaster made Monbiot pro-nuclear and now military attack on nuclear in Ukraine makes him even more so. Good luck with that. Dr Paul Dorfman Associate fellow, Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex • What on earth does George Monbiot mean when he refers to small modular reactors as “kinder nuclear technologies”? SMRs are still vulnerable to accidents and attack (think of what happened in Ukraine); they still produce more nuclear waste per unit of electricity than conventional reactors; and there is still no safe, long-term solution for radioactive waste. Additionally, these reactors will remain dependent on uranium for fuel – when we know that uranium mining has caused suffering and death to mainly indigenous people across the world. Rae Street Littleborough, Greater Manchester • George Monbiot makes a convincing argument for “the comprehensive energy transition that should have happened years ago”. He concludes by asking “So what are we waiting for?” We are waiting for another comprehensive transition – from our enslavement to the mysterious deity called “the market”, which also should have happened years ago. John Airs Liverpool • Michael Gove backs a new commission to explore tidal energy (Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis, 8 March), and reveals a government racked by incompetence. There is already an “oven-ready” Swansea tidal lagoon project, fully costed, and with planning approval. The government failed to back it in 2018. Roger Critchley West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire • Re Larry Elliott’s analysis (West feeling impact of Russia sanctions too as oil and gas prices soar, 7 March), we could reduce consumption of oil, limit our dependency on supplies from Russia and deny revenues to Putin if we reduced speed limits on the roads. When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels in the UK is around 44m litres of petrol and 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.8m litres per day. If the Nato allies were to agree such a strategy, they could inflict a sizeable cut in the financial support being provided for Putin’s war. David Walker Sheffield • Regarding your report (Joe Biden bans Russian oil imports in powerful blow to Putin’s war machine, 8 March), imagine if the US had not withdrawn from the Iranian nuclear accord, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), in 2018. Today, there would be no discussion about oil prices rising to such high levels. Before the withdrawal, Iran was producing 2m to 2.5m barrels a day, with the potential to reach 3.5m to 4m. A return to the JCPOA and the return of Iranian oil to the world markets are vital for a successful grinding down of the Russian economy.

Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK’s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: “The case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. “Even to consider building a £20bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.” The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK’s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: “It’s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.” Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: “We are proud to represent TASC in the local community’s continued fight to help protect Suffolk’s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court’s attention.” The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. • This article was amended on 8 August 2022.

Tufan Erginbilgiç, who took over at the £12bn engineering giant in January, is prevented from viewing “UK eyes only” documents under Whitehall security protocols because he holds joint British and Turkish citizenship, sources said. The Guardian understands that Chris Cholerton, who became the company’s group president in March, has been given responsibility for handling sensitive information related to its submarine business, alongside Steve Carlier, president of the division. Sources close to the company questioned whether it was good governance to have a chief executive excluded from politically-sensitive information related to the business. Rolls-Royce’s submarines division builds the nuclear reactors that power Britain’s fleet of submarines, including the four nuclear warhead-armed Vanguard vessels. It employs more than 1,500 engineers to design, manufacture and support reactors for the vessels used by the UK’s Royal Navy as part of its “continuous at sea deterrent” capability and Rolls-Royce is growing the division significantly as it develops the next generation of reactors to go into the new Dreadnought submarines. The nuclear deterrent has been in place since 1969 and means at least one nuclear warhead-armed submarine, powered by Rolls-Royce, is always on operational patrol. The nuclear deterrent is governed under the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement between the US and the UK and the Polaris Sales Agreement, a treaty on missile systems, signed in 1963. The company also works on the submarines when they are at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in Cumbria and the naval bases at Devonport in Plymouth, and Faslane on the Clyde. Last year, Rolls-Royce’s defence arm accounted for almost a third of its £12.7bn revenues. Erginbilgiç took over from Warren East, who had held the role since 2015, and immediately described the jet engines manufacturer as a “burning platform”. He has brought in consultants and is expected to cut thousands of jobs at the company, which has about 50,000 employees. Cholerton, the former president of Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace business, took on a new role two months ago including responsibility for its nuclear operations including submarines and its business developing small modular reactors (SMRs) – mini nuclear power stations. Erginbilgiç’s appointment was announced last year after a process run by search firm MWM Consulting. The board noted his background in engineering and experience in leading “complex multinational organisations”. Erginbilgiç’s family are from Kilis, close to the Syrian border. He studied engineering at Istanbul Technical University, graduating in 1982 and entered the oil industry after further studies in business and economics. He was chief executive of BP’s downstream business from 2014 to 2020. Erginbilgiç receives an annual salary of £1.25m and was handed shares worth £7.5m as compensation for forfeited pay from BP on joining. He was one of the frontrunners to replace former chief executive Bob Dudley but left the oil major after losing out to Bernard Looney. Rolls-Royce’s articles of association stipulate its chief executive and chairman must be a British, US or EU citizen. The UK government holds a “golden share”, allowing it to veto any takeover, because of its sensitive nuclear work. “UK eyes only” documents are typically marked “UK secret” with a statement that they have been “communicated in confidence” and “should not be released without the agreement of the British government”. The source close to Rolls-Royce said: “There have been questions raised internally about whether it’s right to have a chief executive who is not able to be included in some of the most sensitive areas of the business.” The navy uses a larger class of ballistic deterrent submarine, Vanguard, as well as the Trafalgar and Astute class attack vessels. In March, it was confirmed that Rolls-Royce would provide the reactors for Australia’s nuclear powered submarines as part of the Aukus trilateral pact between the UK, the US and Australia. On Tuesday the company announced plans to double the size of its Raynesway site in Derby as a result of the Aukus deal, creating 1,170 new roles. It is understood Erginbilgiç has clearance to access the site, which is only open to UK citizens. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson said: “As CEO, Tufan is fully responsible for the nuclear submarine business in Rolls-Royce and has all relevant oversight of the operation of that business. “As a global defence supplier, there are occasionally national eyes-only aspects of our work, such as in the US. In relation to the submarine business, Chris Cholerton, group president with responsibility for the submarine business, supports Tufan.” The company did not explain why, as a UK national, Erginbilgiç does not have nuclear clearance for sensitive documents. Rolls-Royce also operates two prototype reactor plants at a “trials establishment” in the north of Scotland on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Sources pointed out that US executives within the company had privileges not available to their British colleagues, and that the Ministry of Defence was aware of Erginbilgiç’s appointment before it was announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T19:57:59Z","webTitle":"Ukraine accuses Russia of destroying another dam to slow counteroffensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine accuses Russia of destroying another dam to slow counteroffensive","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have moved along both sides of the river, southwards from the town of Velyka Novosilka, declaring the liberation of a string of villages: Blahodatne on the east bank; and Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve on the west side. On Monday night, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said three other settlements further west along the frontline – Novodarivka, Levadne in eastern Zaporizhzhia, and Lobkove in western Zaporizhzhia – had also been taken by Ukrainian forces. The armed forces have published pictures of their units holding up flags in what were claimed to be the recaptured villages. The claims could not be independently verified, but Russian military bloggers confirmed the Ukrainian advance and reported heavy fighting overnight and on Monday morning for the next village along, Urozhaine, on the east bank of the river, straddling the road south-east towards Mariupol. Valeriy Shershen, a Ukrainian military spokesperson for that sector of the front, told the Ukrainska Pravda news agency that a dam upstream along the Mokri Yaly had been blown up by occupation forces, causing flooding on both banks. Shershen said the Russian aim had been to “slow down Ukraine’s counteroffensive” but claimed it had failed. The dam appears to have been at the village of Klyuchove but its destruction could not be independently verified. On Sunday, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, celebrated the announcement of the latest village to fall, Storozheve, thanking the marines who recaptured it and adding: “It will be the same with every settlement until we liberate all Ukrainian land.” Ukrainian officials have otherwise been tight-lipped about the counteroffensive, other than to note small territorial gains around Bakhmut, on the northern Donetsk front. The villages along the Mokri Yaly River mark the first settlements to be liberated after a week of counteroffensive, and Kyiv has made much of the capture of these small villages, aware that Ukrainians are nervous after seeing videos of wrecked Ukrainian tanks and armoured vehicles from failed assaults farther west along the line, in Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian military officials have privately called for patience and pointed out they had so far not committed the bulk of Kyiv’s 12 brigade-strong western-armed assault force to the battle. “By the way, we didn’t move our main forces yet,” a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. “So there are grounds to believe in the best.” Kyiv is frustrated that western capitals have so far not pronounced verdicts on responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Officials have pointed out that it would have been almost impossible to cause that amount of damage from external shelling to a structure designed to withstand a tactical nuclear bomb, that it must therefore have been blown up from the inside, and that the Russians had complete control of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station at the time. The Ukrainian security service has published an audio clip of what it said was two Russian soldiers talking about how a Russian sabotage unit had been responsible. Maliar said that in the wake of the disaster, Russia was moving its forces from the left (eastern and southern) bank of the Dnipro in Kherson region to other parts of the frontline. She suggested Russian forces had blown up the dam to make it much harder for Ukrainian assault troops to cross the flooded lower Dnipro, and therefore shorten the front they had to defend. Downstream of the wrecked dam, Ukrainian authorities said the flood waters were beginning to recede at up to 5cm an hour. Upstream meanwhile, the reservoir continued to drain, leaving vast expanses of mud flats and dead fish. According to officials in Kyiv, more than 72% of the reservoir’s capacity, 14,395 cubic kilometres of water, had already been lost. In Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-controlled right (northern) bank of the Dnipro across from the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the water had receded so far that it was impossible to determine its level. Ukraine’s environment minister, Ruslen Strilets, said that despite the disappearance of the reservoir, the nuclear plant had sufficient water to keep its reactor cores and spent fuel cool and prevent a meltdown. “Regarding the power plant, the water level in the plant’s ponds is stable and sufficient to meet the plant’s needs. The situation is now under control,” Strilets said in a television interview. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is due in Ukraine this week hoping to visit the plant. Grossi said on Sunday that his experts needed to check discrepancies in measurements of water levels of the reservoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/24/project-wolf-hunting-review-korean-horror-brings-bruckheimer-esque-bombast","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-24T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Project Wolf Hunting review – Korean horror brings Bruckheimer-esque bombast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/project-wolf-hunting-review-korean-horror-brings-bruckheimer-esque-bombast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/24/project-wolf-hunting-review-korean-horror-brings-bruckheimer-esque-bombast","fields":{"headline":"Project Wolf Hunting review – Korean horror brings Bruckheimer-esque bombast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you had a pound for every slashed jugular and staved-in cranium in this Korean horror-thriller, you would probably have more than the film’s entire budget. This seems to have been mostly spent on supplies of fake blood almost copious enough to run the sprinkler system on Frontier Titan, the 58,000-tonne cargo ship travelling between the Philippines and South Korea in Kim Hong-sun’s film. Forget Con Air; this is Con Sea, with bruiser cop Seok-woo (Park Ho-san) in charge of escorting a dirty dozen or so fugitives back to the motherland. First among evils is Jong-doo (Seo In-guk), a rapist with boyband looks and tattoos up to his jawline, who earns an early beating from Seok-woo after threatening his daughter. It doesn’t take a doctorate in whup-ass studies to guess that the criminals don’t stay in handcuffs for long. But – unbeknown to all but the doctor who keeps sneaking down to the basement – they are not Frontier Titan’s only cargo. Suffice it to say that transporting this thing on the same ship as Korea’s most wanted is the action-movie equivalent of that meme about the nuclear power plant and the spider farm being next to each other. Kim sets up the early square-offs and hijacking with the kind of Bruckheimerian bombast that is becoming a lost art in Hollywood. He makes decent use of the ship’s layout – though spreading the mayhem around a disaster-movie-style ensemble, rather than a single protagonist, means the tension is somewhat diffused. The real main character is gratuitous carnage, already amply supplied by the desperadoes before the third party gets involved. If you’ve ever wanted to see a man beaten to death with his own arm, you’ve come to the right place. The slaughter does start to get monotonous, but the film rallies in its final third as adversaries arrive capable of standing up to the basement boy, including seemingly innocuous-looking felon Do-il (Jang Dong-yoon), and Kim produces a set of pulpy late revelations. By then Die Hard-style precision staging has long since given way to pure Splatterhouse – but what B-movie relish it has. • Project Wolf Hunting is available on the Icon Film Channel on 30 January and in UK cinemas on 3 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/devastation-from-kakhovka-dam-collapse-could-take-decades-to-heal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-07T18:08:44Z","webTitle":"Devastation from Kakhovka dam collapse could take decades to heal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/devastation-from-kakhovka-dam-collapse-could-take-decades-to-heal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/devastation-from-kakhovka-dam-collapse-could-take-decades-to-heal","fields":{"headline":"Devastation from Kakhovka dam collapse could take decades to heal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The people living along Ukraine’s lower Dnipro River must contend with the immediate consequences of the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and flee for safety with whatever they can salvage, but the wider impact could make itself felt for generations. Downstream, the flood waters will subside somewhat as the surge reaches the Black Sea, but many of the villages and towns along the course of the Dnipro may not be habitable again unless and until a new dam is built. Thousands of homes and livelihoods have been swept away, along with countless domesticated and wild animals. The ecological trauma of such an inundation of water and silt has changed the landscape in an instant, wiping away islands and wetlands. It could take years if not decades for the fauna and flora to bounce back. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it the “largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. It is the country’s misfortune to have also been the site of the Chornobyl disaster in 1986, arguably the last calamity on such a scale. With a reservoir of 18bn cubic metres, Nova Kakhovka was one the dams with the largest capacity in the world, according to Mohammad Heidarzadeh, a senior lecturer in the architecture and civil engineering department at the UK’s University of Bath. It was 90 times bigger than the largest dam reservoir in Britain, the Kielder dam in Northumberland. “It is obvious that the failure of this dam will definitely have extensive long-term ecological and environmental negative consequences not only for Ukraine but for neighbouring countries and regions,” Heidarzadeh said. Along with all the debris carried along by the rushing waters are tens of thousands of mines. The flood waters are rolling through a frontline in the war. The banks of the Dnipro have been frontlines since at least November, when Ukrainian forces drove the Russians across the river to the southern bank. Both sides laid mines along the waterfront and they have now been washed away and will be distributed randomly in towns, villages and farmland downstream. A flood means civilians can be blown up many kilometres from a conflict zone, many years after the war. In Mykolaiv oblast, the Halo Trust charity was clearing mines along the Inhulets River, a Dnipro tributary, before it was hit by the flood surge. “The Russians laid the anti-tank mines at the lowest points of the Inhulets River to prevent Ukrainian troops from crossing in vehicles until Mykolaiv was liberated in November 2022,” Jasmine Dann, the Halo location manager for Mykolaiv, said. “These mines are now posing a fatal risk to civilians who are returning to their homes or use the fertile banks to graze their animals, cultivate crops and fish. Our demining teams regularly cross the river to access minefields, but if the river levels rise significantly as a result of this morning’s [dam collapse], these areas will be cut off and we will be unable to clear the mines.” The devastation upstream from the dam is the other side of the coin from the downstream floods – a dearth of water. The level of the Kakhovka reservoir is falling dramatically. Within a few days it will be too low for the water pumps at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, about 120 miles (200km) upstream, to be used to cool its reactor cores and spent fuel stocks. Because the six reactors have shut down and the plant has a very large cooling pool for such an emergency, it should be able to maintain safety for several months at least, as long as the pond remains intact. But that is far from given. The pond, like the plant itself, is in Russian hands. The loss of the reservoir will also mean there will be far less drinking water for cities in the region and irrigation for the agricultural belt around it. A drop of just one metre is enough for traps to run dry. That will have a knock-on effect on food production, and on exports of wheat, corn, sunflower oil and soya beans, to the rest of the world. The Kakhovka reservoir “was the heart of one of the largest irrigation systems in Europe” and its water “made it possible to grow up to 80% of all vegetables in Ukraine and a significant percentage of fruits and grapes”, according to the agricultural thinktank, EastFruit. One of the affected areas is Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014. The canal that supplies water to the peninsula has its intake just above the Nova Kakhovka dam. Crimea’s reservoirs have been topped up in recent months so there will not be an immediate crisis, but over the coming year, it may render the maintenance of a civilian population and an army there untenable, possibly even forcing a withdrawal without a shot being fired. The grim irony of that is unlikely to be lost on Ukrainians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T17:50:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: EU to hold urgent talks over Russian ‘energy war’; Ukraine announces mandatory evacuations – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: EU to hold urgent talks over Russian ‘energy war’; Ukraine announces mandatory evacuations – as it happened ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv.

It comes after the plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after all lines to it were cut on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the plant. The Ukrainian president praised the Ukrainian technicians who operated the plant under the gaze of the Russian military. By Friday afternoon, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said one of the two working reactors had been reconnected to the grid. The one reactor is building up capacity, the agency said, thanking the plant’s working for “tirelessly and firmly” keeping “the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders”. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, according to reports.

The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s front lines. Speaking on national television, Vereshchuk said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive has stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Lukashenko said he had previously agreed the move with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and warned that his country is ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged that there is a risk that public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies.

As always, thank you for reading. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The southern command said in a statement: Rocket artillery units continued to conduct missions, including ensuring control over the Daryivskiy bridge. Its operation is currently halted. The Daryivskiy bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts, Reuters reports. Residents near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have reportedly been given iodine tablets, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe. Associated Press reports that the iodine tablets were issued in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 45 kilometres (27 miles) from the plant. Among those who received the pills were a woman and her small daughter, it writes. It comes after the plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after all lines to it were cut on Thursday. On Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant, with satellite images showing fires around the complex over the last few days. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal that it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. “Frantic preparations” were underway after a breakthrough in negotiation over access, a person familiar with the matter told the paper. The IAEA team could bring spare parts, radiation-monitoring devices and other vital materials to the plant after it was disconnected for the first time in history. It comes a day after the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said the watchdog was “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The WSJ reports that Russia’s opposition to the IAEA’s visit has allegedly softened, allowing Grossi to lead a delegation that will travel to the plant across Ukrainian territory and spend at least one night at the facility. The mission will seek to assess the safety of the plant and address any security problems that have emerged during the fighting. Boris Johnson has condemned Russia’s “cultural vandalism” in Ukraine and vowed that the UK will fund “cultural protection measures” as well as continue to donate civil and military aid to the country. Russian troops are trying to erase Ukrainian culture in areas they have taken over, the British prime minister said in a video message to the Edinburgh International Culture Summit. Johnson said: Throughout history, we’ve seen what happens when aggressors try to oppress and to eliminate culture. We saw it with the Nazis in the Second World War, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, the Taliban in Afghanistan. Today, the world is once again witnessing unforgivable acts of cultural vandalism, this time in Ukraine. He accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “systematically erasing all traces of the centuries-old Ukrainian culture from the territory his troops occupy”. The UK will fund “cultural heritage protection measures” as well as military and humanitarian aid, he said. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s front lines, Reuters reports. Speaking on national television, Vereshchuk said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. She said: I’m not talking about the entire regions, but some parts will require mandatory evacuation and we are preparing for it. She urged residents not to resist and warned they also faced the threat of Russian occupation, adding: If they stay there, people will suffer, especially children. In July, the Ukrainian government launched a campaign of mandatory evacuations for people in the eastern Donetsk region that it began implementing this month. Ukrainian-controlled districts and towns in the industrial east are under constant shelling from Russian and pro-Russian forces. Vereshchuk said: I know very well what the enemy can do to force people to collaborate. That’s why I call on people to evacuate so often and not to hope for the enemy to show mercy and … to follow international humanitarian law. This will not happen. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the current energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech presidency “will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures to address the energy situation,” its prime minister, Petr Fiala, announced. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. The country’s minister of industry and trade, Jozef Síkela, earlier tweeted: We are in an energy war with Russia and it is damaging the whole European Union. It’s just past 5:15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the plant.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. An ONS survey has suggested that many Ukrainians who have come to the UK are struggling to find work because their qualifications are not recognised and due to language difficulties. PA Media reports: Most who have fled the war in their homeland to come to Britain do not know how to access benefits or alter their visas now they have arrived, the findings also indicate, as well as revealing how some feel nervous, anxious or depressed. Experimental research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) questioned a sample of adults who had arrived in the UK by mid-April under Ukraine visa schemes. Some 1,132 people took part in the online survey between July 20 and August 4, which was a follow-up questionnaire to the first of its kind carried out earlier this year. The majority of respondents (93%) were still in the UK but 7% had left since April and the results were based on those who remained in the country at the time of the latest survey. Hugh Stickland, from the ONS, said: “More Ukrainian nationals have now had time to find work since they first arrived in the UK. “However, while a majority of those that aren’t working said they are likely or very likely to look for work, many are struggling to find work due to their qualifications gained abroad not being recognised by UK employers or who are struggling with the English language requirements.” The proportion of Ukrainian nationals employed in the UK has increased to 42% since the first survey and more respondents than before (37%) said they had enough money to support themselves for the next three months. But almost half of the people who took part in the survey (47%) had “experienced some barriers to being able to take up work in the UK”, with the most common reason being because English language skills were not meeting the job requirements (58%). Over half (51%) of respondents, however, indicated they could speak English well or very well. For reading and writing, this was 63% and 51%, respectively. Of those with a qualification gained outside the UK, 43% indicated that UK employers had generally not recognised their qualifications when applying for jobs. According to the findings, most respondents said they did not understand very well or at all well how to apply to extend or change their visa (69%), or what state benefits they may be eligible for (58%). Around one in five (21%) respondents reported feeling nervous, anxious or on edge for more than half the days or nearly every day in the fortnight before filling out the survey. Some 16% reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless for more than half the days or nearly every day in that period. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russia, resumed electricity supplies to Ukraine on Friday after one of its six reactors was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid, state nuclear company Energoatom said. Reuters reports: More than 18,000 people in 72 settlements in Zaporizhzhia region were without electricity as of Friday due to damage caused to powers lines, the regional administration said, without specifying which lines it was talking about. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said Russian shelling had sparked fires on Thursday in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex from the power grid. Russia’s defence ministry blamed Ukraine, saying its forces had destroyed the Ukrainian gun responsible. Workers at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine have been hailed as “heroes” after Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was disconnected from the country’s power grid for the first time in its history. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, has now said one of the two working reactors had been reconnected to the grid. An administrative worker at the plant told CNN earlier today that “everything is already ok”. The plant employee, who has not been named, said: Yesterday there was no electricity, no water, nothing. But everything is already ok, the men [operational staff] at the NPP [Nuclear Power Plant] are just smarties and heroes. They added that with “shelling around the station and the city, smoke from fires, dust from the ash dump of a thermal power plant”, that the “situation sometimes looks like the end of the world” at the plant. A group of lawmakers from Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) are calling for peace negotiations with Russia and for a ceasefire to be reached in Ukraine as soon as possible. In a letter entitled “The guns must be silent!” seen by Der Spiegel, the group representing the pacifist left-wing of the SPD urged for a diplomatic offensive to end the war in Ukraine quickly. They called for a new attempt at a “modus vivendi”, in which conflicting parties agree to coexist in peace, arguing that such a relationship “must be found with the Russian government based on the acknowledgment of realities that one does not like, which rules out a further escalation of the war”. The group propose China act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, oppose rearmament plans and warned against the delivery of heavy military equipment to Ukraine, citing the danger of nuclear war. The letter reads: With every delivery of weapons, it is important to carefully weigh up and consider where the ‘red line’ lies, which could be perceived as entering the war and provoke corresponding reactions. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the grid, according to the country’s state nuclear company. Energoatom said one reactor at the plant has been reconnected to the grid and that it was building up capacity, Reuters reports. In a statement, the company said: Today … at 14:04, one of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s power units that shut down yesterday was connected to the power grid. Ukraine’s nuclear company thanked the workers at the plant, saying: They tirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders and work selflessly so that their native country has life-giving electricity. Representatives from Turkey, Finland and Sweden are expected to meet in Finland today to discuss Turkish concerns about the Nordic pair’s Nato accession, Reuters reports. Finland’s foreign ministry remained tight-lipped about the meeting, refusing to provide details about its location or timing. Speaking to the public broadcaster YLE, Finland’s foreign ministry state secretary, Jukka Salovaara, said: This is a matter of security. If we would tell where Turkey’s high officials are at which time, it would give quite a careless picture of us. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, had earlier said that the first meeting between officials would aim to establish contacts and set goals for cooperation that the three countries had agreed to at Nato’s Madrid summit earlier this year. In June, on the eve of the alliance’s summit in Madrid, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed to lift deal-breaking objections to Sweden and Finland’s Nato accession. A trilateral deal was reached between Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, who signed a memorandum that addressed Turkey’s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. According to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta, Lukashenko said he had previously agreed the move with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Belarus is ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly, Lukashenko warned. He said: If god forbid some serious provocation against Belarus happens, our targets have been locked in. Decision-making centers. We know them. Relations with Belarus “must not be aggravated because it also means aggravating relations with the Union State of Belarus and Russia that has nuclear weapons”, he said. He added: If they start making problems, Belarus may be worse off but the answer will be instantaneous. Belarus does not have its own nuclear weapons but is an ally of Russia and has allowed its territory to be used for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Whether you’re just joining us or need a quick refresher on today’s developments, here’s a quick round-up: Shelling temporarily disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Russian-held plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine was restored hours after being cut by shelling. Ukraine has begun trying to restart operations at two reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports, citing comments by regional governor Oleksandr Starukh. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. Ukraine has begun trying to restart operations at two reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports, citing comments by regional governor Oleksandr Starukh. The plant’s sixth reactor is operating at 10% capacity, while the fifth reactor is in the process of resuming operations, he said in televised comments. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said the plant’s own needs were being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system after it was disconnected from the grid when fires broke out around the plant on Thursday. Turkey’s finance minister has told businesses they should not be worried by threats of sanctions that the US has said will follow if they trade with sanctioned Russians. US deputy secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo told Turkish banks and companies in a letter that they would face secondary sanctions if they worked with sanctioned Russians. In comments representing Turkey’s first official response, Nureddin Nebati tweeted that the letter should not “cause concern in our business circles. Turkey is one of the most important political and economic power centres in the world”. The Nato member has tried to stay neutral in the war and refused to join the international sanctions. Nebati said Turkey was “determined to develop our commercial relations with our neighbours in various sectors – especially tourism – within a framework that is not subject to sanctions”. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged that there is a risk that public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies. Asked if Germany was worried that political support for Ukraine would decline amid tough conditions in winter, Miguel Berger said: I think this is the same challenge here in the UK, for France, for all of Europe. The way Putin is using gas as a weapon and putting pressure on our societies – he wants to test our resolve. Obviously it will depend a lot on the relief packages of our governments. He said the German government has started early, giving grants to companies, direct payments to households, and discussions with trade unions and employers. But he acknowledged that “there is a risk” that support would wane. My colleagues Isobel Koshiw and Emma Graham-Harrison in Kyiv have more on the ongoing concern about the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is still disconnected from the grid after fires broke out around the plant on Thursday. Ukrainian authorities and international experts are increasingly warning that there may be a nuclear catastrophe unless fighting around the plant desists. Problems with the electricity supply to the plant appear to be unresolved as of this morning. The plant was disconnected twice on Thursday when the blaze affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out because of the war. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said that work was under way to restore the plant’s connection to the grid and the plant’s own needs were being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system. Energoatom said it could not comment on Friday on the security systems or the operations of the equipment. On Thursday, it said they had information that they were working normally. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, relies on electricity to keep its reactors cool. During an outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Satellite images published by Ukraine’s Radio Liberty show plumes of smoke rising up near the plant. Germans must start saving energy now in order to prepare for gas shortages this winter, the UK ambassador to the country has said. Asked about whether it is wise to look for new energy deals with “autocratic leaders”, Miguel Berger said: “There is no other option but to look elsewhere, but at the same time we try to speed up as much as possible the energy transition – currently half of our electricity comes from renewable energy but obviously this is not a short-term solution. That’s why we have a discussion on nuclear and we have a discussion on reconnecting – only as a very temporary measure – some coal plants.” He said government measures such as lowering temperatures in office buildings and banning heated pools “should give an example to people that they have to take the measures to save energy”. “There is no way around, half of our heating in Germany is from gas. The best way to have gas for the winter is to start saving it as early as possible.” Germany is facing similar challenges to the UK as Vladimir Putin “tests the resolve” of western nations, Germany’s ambassador to the UK has said. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany amid soaring energy costs, the BBC has reported. Speaking to the Today programme, Miguel Berger said: “We have been observing these flares for quite a while it shows the measures we have taken so far which means we have reduced gas consumption from Russia from over 50% to about 10% is having a strong economy, because they don’t have other places where they can sell their gas so they have to burn it.” Asked about the environmental implications of a temporary shift to coal, Berger said: “We are speaking here about absolute emergency measures – let me say that the challenges you have been describing, with the increase of the price cap [in the UK] is very similar to what we have in Germany, we are all facing the same challenges. We should not forget that Putin is really testing the resolve of western countries.” The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The new cap will be introduced in October, and comes after the price cap was increased in April from £1,277 to £1,971. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told Sky News: “This year … we have seen the slow and deliberate cut-off of gas by Russia to the European market, and that has made prices spike, much, much further.” He said this came after economies grew post-Covid, particularly in Asia, putting pressure on the gas market. The Ofgem boss said winter gas prices were 15 times higher than usual, and were equivalent to paying £400 to £500 to fill up a car with petrol. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to BBC News, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. Scientists are concerned about the quantities of carbon dioxide and soot the new liquified natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg, is creating. The plant is near a compressor station at the start of the Nordstream 1 pipeline, which transports gas to Germany. Finnish citizens reported seeing a large flame earlier this summer, and researchers have reported a significant increase in heat coming from the facility. While gas flaring is a normal process used in industry, the scale at which gas is being burned at the plant was unprecedented, researchers said. “I’ve never seen an LNG plant flare so much,” Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio, told the broadcaster. “Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn’t go away. It’s stayed very anomalously high.” All six reactors of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine are still disconnected from Ukraine’s electricity grid, Reuters reports, citing state nuclear company Energoatom. However, the company said there were currently no issues with the plant’s machinery or its safety systems. Energoatom said electricity for the plant’s own needs was being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system. It comes after fires, caused by shelling, cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Blackmail is the “hallmark of modern Russia”, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry has said, describing Moscow’s leveraging of energy and nuclear power. Speaking about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which normally supplies Ukraine with a fifth of its energy, Yuriy Sak said: “Russia is using the tactics of blackmailing Ukraine as well as other international partners of Ukraine into trying to negotiate some favourable deals in the future. The tactics of blackmail – nuclear blackmail, energy blackmail – these are the hallmarks of the Russian of the modern Russia. “We understand it very well and we hope that the international community will stand firm in not budging to the Russian tactic of blackmailing.” Russian soldiers must leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in order to guarantee safety, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister has said. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Yuriy Sak said that since the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was captured by Russian soldiers in March, it has been controlled by them but run by Ukrainian personnel. “Our personnel is trying everything they can in the circumstances to ensure it functions uninterruptedly … The power plant poses a risk to the whole of Europe.” Asked about updates on whether Russia will allow international inspectors on to the plant site, he said: “We have claims by the Russian side that they will allow this inspection – we hope that they honour that commitment but the ultimate solution is not just admitting the inspection … the ultimate solution is the complete demilitarisation of the nuclear plant, [and] making sure that the Russian soldiers leave Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This will be the only guarantee that nothing major happens.” Russia blames the Ukrainian military for strikes in the area. Switzerland is bracing for power shortages this winter due to its reliance on Russian gas and French nuclear power, AFP reports. The country relies on hydropower in the summer months but turns to imports at other times. With Russia slashing gas deliveries, Switzerland is particularly vulnerable as it lacks its own gas storage installations. Exacerbating the issue, France has been forced to halt production at half of its reactors, mainly due to corrosion problems. The Swiss government but has said it is readying the country for power shortages, with the head of the federal electricity commission, Werner Luginbuhl, warning of repeated, hours-long power cuts. Hello, I’m Clea Skopeliti and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. You can reach me via email, or send me a DM on Twitter, when I’m @cleaskopeliti. It’s 9.15am in Kyiv. When Mikhail Sokolov signed up to work for the FSB security services, he never imagined his journey would end here: in a crowded refugee camp on the outskirts of a sleepy town in the rural Netherlands. “The last six years were a rollercoaster. I am happy I am no longer in the claws of the FSB,” the former FSB informant and staffer for the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption network said in an interview with the Guardian this week. The 25-year-old is now living in a crowded dormitory, shunned by fellow activists, while being trolled online by his former FSB handlers. Sokolov’s story shines a rare light on the inner workings of Moscow’s secretive security services and their attempts to infiltrate the Russian opposition at home and abroad. He is part of what appears to be a trend of ex-FSB informers coming clean after Moscow’s decision to invade Ukraine. “I am convinced there were hundreds of us,” Sokolov said, sitting at a cafe near the refugee centre in the south of the Netherlands. “Nearly every organised opposition group had an informer at low or mid-level.” Read the full story below. Ukraine’s capital renamed 95 streets on Thursday as part of a drive to purge Russian and Soviet place names, Kyiv’s mayor announced a day after Ukraine marked 31 years of independence. Since Russia invaded in February, Ukraine has accelerated what it calls “derussification”, a campaign to shed the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow. Kyiv mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, said: [The new names] should perpetuate the memory of significant historical events of Ukraine, as well as famous figures and heroes who glorified Ukraine and fought for the independence of our state.” One street was named after London while another was dubbed “Ukrainian rebirth street.” Another street, previously bearing the surname of a Soviet defence minister, was renamed after Ukraine’s Azov regiment. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. Earlier in the week, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation that Russia was slowing its campaign to reduce casualties. It is also highly likely that Shoigu and Russian president Vladimir Putin have fired at least six generals for not advancing quickly enough, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Russia’s offensive has stalled because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Under Shoigu’s orders, the forces operating in Ukraine have repeatedly missed planned operational timelines.” Russia and its proxy forces in Ukraine are operating 21 locations used to detain, interrogate and process prisoners of war and civilians, according to a new report by Yale University researchers backed by the US state department. The Conflict Observatory report cites commercial satellite imagery and open-source information to identify with ‘high confidence’ the separate locations - including facilities that previously served as schools, markets and regular prisons. It also identifies possible graves at one prison complex. A Conflict Observatory hub that analyses evidence of Russian war crimes released a report on Thursday which they say provides proof of forced deportation and filtration camps in Ukraine. The Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health that produced the report is a partner in a US state department-funded Conflict Observatory launched in May to capture and analyse evidence of war crimes and other atrocities allegedly perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine. Nathaniel Raymond, the lab’s executive director, said the findings showed Russia and its proxies had established a “system of filtration” to sort people in areas that fall under Russian occupation that represents a “human rights emergency.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of deporting hundreds of thousands of people from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Thursday’s report focused on Donetsk region, where Russia and its proxy the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic took control of most of the city of Mariupol in March. The city’s mayor said in April that about 40,000 civilians from the city had been forcibly moved into Russian-controlled territory or taken to Russia. The report identified a system that brings in civilians in conflict-affected areas, puts them through registration and interrogation before they are either released, kept in detention, or transported to Russia. Outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has reportedly received a discount card for any future trips taken on Ukrainian trains. A photo of Johnson shared by Ukrainian media outlets shows the PM holding a loyalty card “Ukrzaliznytsia” number 001. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Zelenskiy also urged: The IAEA and other international organisations must act much faster than they’re acting now. Because every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster.” At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The US has condemned any Russian bid to divert energy from Ukraine where authorities said the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was cut off from its national grid. State department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters: The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable. No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” Ukraine earlier said that Zaporizhzhia - the largest nuclear facility in Europe - for the first time was severed form its national grid after fighting around the complex. President Joe Biden, in a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in UN nuclear inspectors, the White House said. Bonnie Jenkins, the under secretary of state for arms control, said Moscow bore responsibility for the plant’s safety. “Their actions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident - a dangerous radiation release - that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine but also affect neighbouring countries and the entire international community,” Jenkins told reporters. “The risk of radiation release could be all but eliminated if Russia returns control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back to Ukraine and fully withdraws from Ukraine’s sovereign territory,” she said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling. The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. Addressing the nation on Wednesday evening, he said: Today, for the first time in history, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped. The emergency protection of the power units worked - after the last working line of the plant’s power return to the Ukrainian power system was damaged by Russian shelling. If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident. Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Shelling temporarily disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st independence day, celebrated on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said he had “a great conversation” and thanked Biden for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T11:28:32Z","webTitle":"EDF sues French government for £7bn after being forced to sell energy at a loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","fields":{"headline":"EDF sues French government for £7bn after being forced to sell energy at a loss","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French nuclear company EDF is suing its own government for €8.3bn (£7bn) after it was forced to sell energy to consumers at a loss. The company, which is being nationalised by the French state, has filed a compensation claim over the extension of the country’s price cap in January. Emmanuel Macron’s government forced EDF to sell more of its power to rivals at prices below the market rates as officials attempted to tackle the cost of living crisis and support households. The energy company has to sell electricity to rivals at a heavy discount as a counterbalance to its monopoly position. French officials increased the cap on the discount by a fifth in January, hitting its finances. EDF said the move meant it had to sell energy at a loss. In the claim, filed at the French administrative supreme court, the Conseil d’Etat, it said losses have totalled €8.3bn “estimated to date”, implying that the measure could cost the company more than €15bn over the year. The nuclear energy giant had previously estimated the administrative changes could cost between €7.7bn and €8.4bn. It posted its largest ever half-year loss last month, notching up €5.3bn, compared with a profit of €4.2bn a year earlier. EDF is 84% owned by the French government and last month officials revealed plans to buy the remaining 16% for €12 a share, working out at an estimated total of €9.7bn. The government hopes nationalising the debt-laden company will help secure energy supplies in the country after the war in Ukraine left countries hunting for new sources of power to replace Russian imports. Last month, an association of EDF employee shareholders said it planned to sue the French state over its nationalisation plans, arguing that the decision goes against the interest of the company and the minority shareholders. EDF, which is developing the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, is already tackling problems with its nuclear plants in France. The power stations typically provide nearly 70% of France’s electricity but this is expected to hit a three-decade low this year due to a string of technical and maintenance issues. The heatwave sweeping Europe has also caused problems – EDF last week said it was temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as hot weather pushes up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. On Monday, France’s nuclear power regulator extended temporary waivers allowing five of the company’s power stations to continue discharging hot water into rivers. In the UK, EDF closed the Hinkley Point B power station in Somerset after 46 years of operation this month. The Hinkley Point C development has been delayed and is over-budget, while the company’s plans to develop a sister power station at Sizewell C in Suffolk received planning approval last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T16:34:33Z","webTitle":"Russia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","fields":{"headline":"Russia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces had occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two and a half months. After a long and grinding battle, Ukraine’s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days, Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his “special military operation” in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv. Over the weekend, Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river’s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counteroffensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people from learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin on Monday of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said all three of its nuclear reactors were working normally and had not been damaged. “Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff,” it said. The agency published two photographs showing a large crater that it said was caused by the blast. “They forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before it’s too late,” Zelenskiy wrote on his Telegram channel. He has previously accused Putin of nuclear terrorism and blackmail and has called on the international community to intervene. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces since the start of the invasion. Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive to liberate the nearby city of Kherson. It has made slower progress than in the Kharkiv region, across a flat steppe terrain and with Russian units dug in. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant, at Zaporizhzhia – which is Europe’s largest and lies about 155 miles (250km) east of the Mykolaiv site – was shut down this month owing to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend that one of the four main power lines at Zaporizhzhia had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russia soldiers have used the territory to shell the Ukrainian-controlled cities of Nikopol and Marhanets across the Dnieper River. More than 40 countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency have urged Putin to hand control of the station back to Ukraine. Invasion by Luke Harding (Guardian Faber, £20).

In his budget speech, the chancellor confirmed plans to spend the money over the next two decades on carbon capture and low carbon energy projects; announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. The government has created Great British Nuclear, a body designed to ease the creation of nuclear projects which are regularly delayed and over budget, and set a target for nuclear to “provide up to one quarter of our electricity by 2050”. Hunt, who has been under pressure to respond to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, said: “Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations.” However, climate campaigners attacked the drive, which had no giveaways for the solar or wind industries. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies? “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now. “Committing to £20bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.” Helen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: “This spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as ‘environmentally sustainable’ and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK’s commitment to climate leadership.” Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed £700m towards. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a “huge step forward for UK energy security and net zero”. But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: “There is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.” Britain’s energy industry has been under the spotlight since the war in Ukraine pushed already-high oil and gas prices higher. On Wednesday, Hunt confirmed a widely expected U-turn in on a planned cut to energy support for households. He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to £11bn, representing just a fifth of the £55bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell. The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by £4bn this year, and £10bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November. The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further £3bn “but much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recouped” over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/15/centrica-british-gas-owner-expected-to-reveal-record-profits-of-3bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T15:08:48Z","webTitle":"British Gas owner expected to reveal record profits of £3bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/15/centrica-british-gas-owner-expected-to-reveal-record-profits-of-3bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/15/centrica-british-gas-owner-expected-to-reveal-record-profits-of-3bn","fields":{"headline":"British Gas owner expected to reveal record profits of £3bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The owner of British Gas is poised to reveal record annual profits of more than £3bn, weeks after suspending the forced installation of prepayment meters due to concerns over its treatment of vulnerable customers. Analysts expect Centrica, which owns Britain’s largest energy supplier, to post underlying profits of £3.3bn in 2022 on Thursday, up from £948m in 2021. The earnings, aided by surging profits in its North Sea oil and gas division, are expected to surpass the company’s previous profit high of £2.7bn, recorded in 2012. In the decade since, Centrica’s share price has tumbled as hundreds of thousands of British Gas customers have fled to rivals, including a string of new players that subsequently went bust during the energy crisis. British Gas has taken on some of those customers through the supplier of last resort process. Centrica is likely to face criticism for reporting huge profits on the back of a surge in wholesale gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up prices for consumers. The company has also been in the spotlight over its treatment of vulnerable customers after it emerged that debt agents working for British Gas ignored vulnerabilities to break into customers’ homes to fit prepayment meters to recover debts. The company suspended the use of court warrants to install prepayment meters, and the government and energy regulator Ofgem later ordered all energy suppliers to pause the tactic. City analysts at Bernstein said the environment in the squeezed commodities market was “supportive” of higher profits at Centrica, “albeit tempered by the windfall taxes on nuclear as well as oil and gas”. Centrica has a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations, which are run by EDF and are subject to the electricity generator levy implemented by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to capture windfall gains. Bernstein expects Centrica’s profits to reduce to about £2bn in 2023, still far above levels before the energy crisis. Investors will be keen to learn Centrica’s forecasts for the price of wholesale gas, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks to below levels seen before the outbreak of war in Ukraine – although it is still above historic averages. It is hoped these falls will feed through into consumer bills over the coming months. The energy consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Wednesday it had seen indications that suppliers may be “able to offer competitively priced tariffs within a matter of weeks”. The government’s energy price guarantee policy has discouraged consumers from switching energy supplier during the winter as they receive about the same price regardless of supplier. But the consultancy predicts that millions of households could switch their energy supplier in second half of 2023, when bills are expected to ease. Household switching rates dropped from an average of 496,000 electricity supply points moving each month in 2019 to 85,000 a month in 2022."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T01:29:33Z","webTitle":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said Russia may plan to decouple the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from the Ukrainian power grid, backing up warnings from Ukraine’s own nuclear power firm. Macron spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday and said the call was necessary because of the urgent nuclear threat to Europe. Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents. “The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said. Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown. Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato. The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement. Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity. On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said. Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war. “Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter. Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm. The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems. The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter. “The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.” Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”. “The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.” He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said. “They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.

In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"West prepares for Putin to use ‘whatever tools he’s got left’ in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"West prepares for Putin to use ‘whatever tools he’s got left’ in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Western leaders are preparing for Vladimir Putin to use “whatever tools he’s got left” including nuclear threats and cyber-attacks in response to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia. British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. G7 officials said there was an “open exchange of views” in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on “future prospects” for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table. However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job. Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support – including more tanks and fighter jets – the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its “rainy day fund”. A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support. The group said that “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to “intensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing” sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow. It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for “bravely” denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia’s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a “vassal” to the US on foreign policy. He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be “humiliated” and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin’s attempts to divide and conquer. Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe. In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market. The UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/jun/05/rishi-sunak-illegal-migration-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-energy-uk-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T17:19:59Z","webTitle":"Lawyers, not politicians, will decide what should held back from Covid inquiry, MPs told – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/05/rishi-sunak-illegal-migration-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-energy-uk-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/jun/05/rishi-sunak-illegal-migration-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-energy-uk-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"Lawyers, not politicians, will decide what should held back from Covid inquiry, MPs told – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government has acquired two more giant barges to house 1,000 asylum seekers, Rishi Sunak has confirmed, as he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” was working. But some Tories do not seem to believe his plan is working. In a development that should worry Sunak, even the Daily Express, which is normally ultra-supportive of the government, is reporting that Conservative MPs are highly sceptical. Rishi Sunak has taken an RAF helicopter from London to Dover, despite the trip being just over an hour by train. Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, has told MPs that the judicial review of the Covid inquiry’s decision to demand unredacted WhatsApp messages from the government will start on or soon after 30 June. (See 5.33pm.) He said the government was only trying to ensure that “unambiguously irrelevant” material would not have to be handed over. This was so that, in future, ministers would be able to continue to have policy discussions in private without having to worry about those messages being submitted to an inquiry on a wholly different topic. Quin also said that, if the courts agreed that “unambiguously irrelevant” material did not have to be handed over, it would be lawyers, not politicians, who would decide what counted as unambiguously irrelevant. (See 5.50pm.) The inquiry also accepts that unambiguously irrelevant material should be kept secret. But it says its lawyers, not the government’s lawyers, should have the final say as to what counts as irrelevant. Matt Hancock has been forced to apologise after parliament’s sleaze watchdog found he broke House of Commons rules by trying to lobby an official investigating another Conservative MP for lobbying. Back in the Commons, in response to a question from the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman, Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, said ministers were not involved at all in deciding what messages and documents would be handed over to the Covid inquiry and what might be held back by the government because it was deemed “unambiguously irrelevant”. He said: I want to give [Blackman] an absolute assurance that there’s absolutely no political involvement in this process of going through what is and is not relevant information, and unambiguously irrelevant. That is a process undertaken by lawyers, by the counsel team, with a KC involved. Keir Starmer told reporters this morning that, if Labour were in office, it would hand over to the Covid inquiry whatever documents it wanted. He said: I’ll be very clear. If you had a Labour government, and we set up an inquiry of this importance, of course we would cooperate and hand over whatever is required by the chair of the inquiry. And I’ll tell you for why – because many people lost relatives in Covid, many people lost their jobs and their livelihoods and they deserve answers and so I’ll be very clear – we would hand over whatever is required by the chair and we would do it having a mind for those that lost so much during Covid. Here is a question from a reader. Is there any reliable, authoritative, recent data on how significant an issue ‘small boats’ immigration is amongst population? Polling consistently shows that small boats and illegal immigration is an important issue to some voters, but not as important as matters like the cost of living. Ipsos has published some polling today relevant to this and, as Keiran Pedley from the polling firm reports, 29% of people say they view removing migrants who arrived illegally as important. But the Ipsos polling also shows that Tory voters care about illegal immigration a lot more than Labour voters. Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, subsequently told MPs that the judicial review hearing would start on or shortly after 30 June, Cat Neilan from Tortoise reports. Quin is responding to Anderson. He says he cannot say how much the judicial review will cost. But he says he is glad the courts have indicated that the case will be “heard very soon”, and dealt with in a “timely fashion”. He says there is a long tradition of former ministers getting help with legal costs in cases like this. Fleur Anderson, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, is responding to Quin. She focuses on a series of questions. How much will the judicial review cost? And what are the chances of the government winning? Would not time be better spent complying with the inquiry’s requests? Is it right that Boris Johnson has been threatened with the withdrawal of legal support? Has Johnson already handed over material to the inquiry? And how many devices has he handed over? The Suella Braverman statement is now over, and in the Commons Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, is now making a statement explaining why the government is challenging the Covid inquiry’s demand to see unredacted WhatsApp messages from Boris Johnson, and other material, as part of its investigation. Quin says the government is cooperating with the inquiry, and has submitted material to the inquiry. But the government takes the view that it should not have to submit material that is “clearly and unambiguously irrelevant” to the inquiry. He says the government is going to court to clarify whether it has the right to do this. He says no decision about what counts as “unambiguously irrelevant” would be taken by a witness alone. Lawyers would be involved in this decision, he says. He says the government is going to court on this matter because it believes that people in government should be able to debate decisions in private “unclouded” by the worry that in future that information could be disclosed to a public inquiry on a wholly different topic. The Conservative MP Bob Stewart will not lose the Tory whip, despite being charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, according to HuffPost’s Kevin Schofield. Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, is the first backbencher to ask a question. He tells Braverman that getting asylum seekers to share rooms, using barges, and “relying on the French” is “not the answer”. He asks when the first deportations to Rwanda will start. Braverman says she has “huge confidence” in the Rwanda plan, but says it is still being challenged in the courts. She says she hopes flights will start “as soon as possible”. Braverman is replying to Cooper. She accuses her of just offering theatrics and words, and not having a plan. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is responding to Braverman. She says Rishi Sunak flew to Dover this morning “to congratulate himself and to tell us that his plan is working”. But, says Cooper, the asylum application backlog is at a record high, the number of caseworkers employed is down, hotel use is up, and returns are down. And only 1% of last year’s applications have been processed, she says. She says the “massive gap” between the government’s rhetoric and reality shows that Braverman has no grip on the system. And she says that although small boat arrivals have been down over the winter, they are still three times higher than two years ago, and eight times higher than before the pandemic. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, starts by saying that Rishi Sunak, unlike Labour, has made stopping the boats a priority. She says raids on illegal workers increased by 50% between January and March, compared with the previous year. She says immigration enforcement arrests have doubled. The asylum initial decision backlog is down by 17,000, she says. And she claims the government is on track to clear that legacy backlog by the end of the year. She says a more “cost-effective” accommodation system is being introduced for asylum seekers, and the barge will arrive in Portland to house them within a fortnight. Migrants are also being housed in Wethersfield and Scampton, she says. She highlights the deals with France and Albania, repeating the figures cited by Rishi Sunak this morning. (See 12.55pm.) She says the government remains committed to the Rwanda policy. And she says the government is legislating, through the illegal migration bill, to break the business model of people smugglers. And she ends by apologising to Yvette Cooper for the latedelivery of her statement. (See 4.08pm.) Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is about to make a statement to MPs about illegal immigration. We are expecting it to largely or wholly echo what Rishi Sunak said this morning. She was due to start at about 4pm, because the urgent question wrapped up early, but Yvette Cooper, her Labour shadow, complained that she had not received a copy of what Braverman was going to say in time to allow her to prepare, and so, in an unusual move, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, suspended the sitting for 10 minutes to allow Cooper to read the statement. Heather Hallett, the chair of the UK Covid-19 public inquiry, may have to resign if the government succeeds in its high court attempt to block the unredacted disclosure of ministers’ WhatsApp messages, the lawyer representing thousands of bereaved families has said. Robert Booth has the story here. The Conservative MP Bob Stewart has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence after an incident outside the Foreign Office’s Lancaster House on 14 December last year, PA Media reports. Police opened a case after the complaint from activist Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, who says he is living in exile after being tortured in the Gulf state of Bahrain. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: Robert Alexander Stewart, 73, a Member of Parliament, of Beckenham, Bromley, was charged by postal requisition on Monday June 5 with: -Using threatening or abusive words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour and the offence was racially aggravated. (Contrary to section 31 (1) (c) and (5) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.) -Using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. (Contrary to section 5 (1) and (6) of the Public Order Act 1986.) Both offences are alleged to have occurred on Wednesday, 14 December 2022 in Belgravia, London, SW1. Stewart will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, 5 July. The Met said both charges related to the same incident and that the “second offence is an alternative charge to allow the court discretion on the racial element”. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has apologised to the Commons having been found to have broken the rule that says MPs should not lobby the parliamentary commissioner for standards. (See 11.55am.) In a very brief statement in the chamber, he said the commissioner had found that he “inadvertently” committed a “minor” breach of the code. The Commons standards committee said he should apologise to the house, he said. “I am happy to do so,” he added. In her World at World interview, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was also asked if she agreed that Jamie Driscoll should be given a second chance to apply to be Labour’s candidate for the new north-east mayor. (See 2.37pm.) She dodged the question entirely, claiming that she did not know the details of this case, and that she would not comment on individual cases like this anyway. Last week some asylum seekers allocated to a hotel in London refused to enter after being told they would have to sleep four to a room. The protest reportedly ended after they were offered sharing on a two-people-per-room basis. In his speech this morning Rishi Sunak claimed this was a new policy that could save taxpayers £250m a year. He said: By asking people to share rooms, where it’s appropriate to do so we’ve found an additional 11,500 places which will save taxpayers an extra £250m a year. And I say to those migrants who are objecting: this is more than fair. In an interview on the World at One Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was asked if Labour was in favour of asylum seekers sharing rooms in hotels. She insisted this policy had “always been part of the asylum system” and was “not new”, adding: “Of course it will continue.” She said the government needed more hotel rooms for refugees because it was failing to clear the backlog of unprocessed applications. Keir Starmer has moved to calm a growing rift with the GMB union over Labour’s energy policy, even as its leader renewed his attack on the party’s plan to prohibit new North Sea oil and gas developments, Alex Lawson reports, Richard Drax is the Conservative MP for South Dorset. Portland is in his constituency and he told LBC that he was opposed to the decision to put asylum seekers on a barge there. In his speech this morning Rishi Sunak said the first occupants would arrive within a fortnight. As LBC’s Henry Riley reports, Drax said in his interview the barge would be a “quasi prison”. Jamie Driscoll, the Labour North of Tyne mayor who has been blocked by the party from standing to be its candidate for the new north-east mayor (which takes in the North of Tyne mayoralty, but covers a wider area), has hinted that he might take legal action to contest the decision. In an interview on the World at One, Driscoll said there was no process in the Labour party rules allowing him to appeal against the decision not to let him be a candidate. But asked if he was considering legal action, he replied: Obviously I’m taking advice on that. And I would absolutely prefer not to go down that route if it’s possible. Driscoll said Labour should just restart the process. He explained: What I think should happen is incidentally in 2019, when we went through this process of selection last time, the party stopped the process and restarted it again a month later, because they weren’t happy that any women had applied. So there’s a precedent that you can stop these processes and start them again. And all I really want is to let the people of the north-east choose who is their mayor and not let London Labour choose who is their mayor. Labour has said Driscoll was blocked because he shared a platform with Ken Loach, the film director who has strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn against the claims that Corbyn tolerated antisemitism in the party. Loach was expelled from Labour in 2021. In his World at One interview, Driscoll said that he was just talking to Loach at an arts event about his films, and particularly those set in the north-east, and that Labour was in “a dark place” if that made him unacceptable as a candidate. He said: If talking to someone about films, because they may have controversial views elsewhere, is grounds for denying members the chance to make their own judgment on that, then I think we’ve gone to quite a dark place indeed when it comes to democracy. Driscoll implied that he had been assured by the party that he was not being accused himself of being antisemitic. He said: I’ve asked very clearly in the selection process, ‘Is that any suggestion that I’m antisemitic?’. And it was quite clearly, ‘No, you are not.’ But he suggested his leftwing politics probably made him unacceptable to the party. While he laughed at the claim that he was the “last Corbynista in power”, he said: I think there’s a pattern of behaviour. I was talking to a journalist this morning who was saying that: ‘You must be about the fourth candidate from your part of the world who’s been blocked from getting on to a long list who is on the left of the party.’ I do support common ownership of the utilities. I do believe in a wealth tax. I don’t believe in increasing privatisation in the NHS. And those are things that, for whatever reason, is not what Keir Starmer is now saying. Obviously, it’s the platform he ran on. The Refugee Council has condemned Rishi Sunak’s speech this morning. In a statement, Enver Solomon, its CEO, said: The British people want those fleeing horror to be treated with dignity and humanity. The prime minister’s approach fails that test to a shocking degree. His claim that the system is “overwhelmed” by people from safe countries is misleading, wrong and harmful. Most of those who arrive here on boats are refugees fleeing places like Afghanistan and Sudan. Keir Starmer has issued a statement in response to Rishi Sunak’s small boats speech, linking it (rather creatively) to his visit to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset this morning. Starmer claimed small boats and nuclear power were both examples of “dither and delay” by the government. He said: We need to stop the boats. We’re clear we don’t want anyone making that dangerous journey. But all we’ve had from the government is policies that aren’t working, then the re-announcement of the same policy, with a self-congratulatory pat on the back. It feels like groundhog day and it’s costing the taxpayer a fortune. There’s a growing sense of frustration about the government’s dither and delay. I’m at Hinkley Point C today, a fantastic project showcasing the talent and skills our country has, but it’s behind schedule and there’s a frustration that there’s no real plan from the government to drive it forward. Whether it’s small boats or nuclear, there’s a pattern of behaviour here and it’s holding our country back. Colin Yeo, a prominent immigration barrister, has published a good analysis of Rishi Sunak’s small boat claims (see 12.55pm) on his Free Movement website. He accepts that the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats does seem to be down by around 20% so far this year (the latest figures are here), but he says there is no evidence this has anything do with the illegal migration bill. Yeo’s article is worth reading in full, but here is an extract. It is conceivable [the fall in numbers] might be related to the Rwanda plan. However, there are three other potential explanations which are also plausible. One is that people are shifting route again in order to try and enter by clandestine means. So far, those arriving in small boats have wanted to be detected. The whole idea was to claim asylum, which involves making yourself known to the authorities. As I’ve previously suggested, if being detected (a) has no benefits (because your asylum claim will never be considered) and (b) actually carries risks (because you might be detained and then removed to Rwanda) then migrants might either decide not to come or decide to avoid detection. Another is that the weather has been worse this year than last. Small boat crossings are heavily dependent on the weather. Another is that the efforts to prevent departures from the French coast have been more effective. Sunak says they have. That’s got nothing to do with the Rwanda plan or how migrants are treated once they reach the UK, though. Given there has never been any evidence that deterrent policies actually work, I’d guess that the three alternative explanations have more to do with the reduction compared to last year. If it’s all about the weather, I suppose we’d soon see crossings increase to comparable or higher numbers than last year. There’s no good way I can think of to test the other hypotheses. By their nature we can’t count clandestine arrivals. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says Rishi Sunak’s claims today (see 12.55pm) do not match reality. The text of Rishi Sunak’s speech in Dover on illegal migration is here. And here are the highlights from what he said in his opening remarks, and in the Q&amp;A. Sunak claimed that his plan to stop small boats was “starting to work”, saying crossings were down 20% this year. He said: My message is this – our plan is starting to work. Before I launched my plan in December, the number entering the UK illegally in small boats had more than quadrupled in two years. Some said this problem was insoluble or just a fact of 21st century life. They’d lost faith in politicians to put in the hard yards to do something about it. And, of course, we have a long way still to go. But in the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20 per cent compared to last year. That’s right: crossings are down 20 per cent. This is the first time since this problem began that arrivals between January and May have actually fallen compared to the year before. He brushed aside suggestions that the fall in numbers was partly due to bad weather. Asked how he could be sure his policies were a factor, he said that the 20% fall in UK arrivals coincided with illegal immigration into the rest of Europe going up by 30%. And asked specifically about the strong winds in the Channel in recent days, which are said to explain why the recent arrival numbers have been very low, he just said weather was not something he could control. Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, claimed the weather was the key factor. Sunak said the government has acquired two new barges to house asylum seekers. He said: To reduce pressures on local communities, we’ll also house people on ships. The first will arrive in Portland in the next fortnight. And we’ve secured another two today that will accommodate another 1,000. He also said the camps for asylum seekers at the former military bases at Wethersfield and Scampton would open soon, with “hundreds” moving in over the summer and almost 3,000 being housed on those sites by the autumn. He said that the French stopped 33,000 people crossing the Channel last year, up 40% on the previous year, and that interceptions this year by the French are “up considerably”. He said that small boat arrivals from Albania were down 90% as a result of the returns agreement he signed. He said: In December I reached a deal with Albania because last year nearly a third of all those arriving in small boats were from that safe European country. That’s delivering too. We’ve now returned 1800 to Albania in just six months. We’ve gone from accepting around 1 in 5 Albanian asylum cases to now just 1 in 50 – in line with our European partners. And what is the result of all of this? So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90 per cent. This is proof that our deterrence strategy can work. When people know that if they come here illegally, they won’t get to stay - they stop coming. He said that the refusal rate for asylum seekers claiming to be victims of modern slavery has tripled since the evidence requirements were tightened. He claimed he was still on track to clear the backlog of legacy asylum applications awaiting decisions. He said: I promised to clear through the backlog of people waiting for initial decision. Numbers published today show the initial decision legacy backlog is down by over 17,000. And we’re on track to clear it entirely by the end of the year. Mark Easton, the BBC’s home affairs correspondent, says Sunak is wrong about this. He defended the plan to hold child migrants in detention, saying that exempting them would risk creating an “incentive” for people to put more young people on small boats. He said: On detention, the reason that’s in place is because we don’t want to create an incentive for people to put children on these boats. If you exempted children from the policy then it would give every incentive for people to bring children on with them and you put more children at risk actually so I don’t think that’s the right thing to do. Obviously there are appropriate facilities for families so they’re not separated, they’re kept together. We need to make sure that that’s done properly and fairly as it always has been and will continue to do so. I think it would be a mistake to exclude children because it would create an incentive for people to put more children on the boats and that would be awful. There will be one urgent question in the Commons today, on Kosovo, followed by statements on illegal migration and on the Covid inquiry. Rishi Sunak took a helicopter to Dover today, instead of taking the train, Peter Walker reports. This is something that has happened a lot before; Sunak uses helicopters, for government trips (funded by the taxpayer) and for party/personal trips (paid for by himself, or by donors) probably more than any of his predecessors. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, should apologise for breaking Commons rules that say MPs should not try to influence an inquiry by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, the Commons standards committee said in a report this morning. It said that although Hancock’s offence was relatively minor, he has still not acknowledged that he made a mistake. The committee said: This was a minor breach of the code; however, Mr Hancock has still not acknowledged his mistake. We recommend that he should apologise to the house and to the commissioner by means of a personal statement, the terms of which should be agreed in advance by Mr Speaker and the chair of the committee. We also recommend that Mr Hancock attends a briefing on his obligations under the code with the commissioner. Daniel Greenberg, the commissioner, opened an investigation earlier this year into a claim that Steve Brine, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, broke Commons lobbying rules by contacting a cabinet minister on behalf of a firm that was paying him. When he heard about the inquiry, Hancock sent Greenberg an unsolicited letter saying that he thought Brine had acted in the national interest during the Covid inquiry and that Brine “did nothing improper and should be cleared from any accusation given his actions were in line with his duties as a member of parliament”. Greenberg then launched an inquiry into Hancock because his letter appeared to be a breach of a rule for MPs saying: Members must not lobby a member of the committee on standards, the independent expert panel or the parliamentary commissioner for standards, or their staff, in a manner calculated or intended to influence their consideration of whether a breach of the code of conduct has occurred, or in relation to the imposition of a sanction. Greenberg said Hancock had broken this rule, and the committee agreed. It said: This case underlines that respect for the code and the processes for investigating potential breaches of the code, which were voted for by the house, is an important and necessary part of the code. We expect Mr Hancock to reflect his understanding of this in his apology. Q: Are you satisfied that the French are doing enough to stop the boats. What is their interception rate? Is that good value for money for the £500m being spent by the British taxpayer? Sunak says the French stopped 33,000 people crossing the Channel last year. That was 40% up on the previous year, he says. And he says this year, whether you look at the figures for the first quarter, or for the first five months, the interception rate in France is “up considerably”, he says. Q: How long will you allow children to be detained for? Sunak says, if children were excluded from the detention policy, that would provide an incentive for children to be put on boats. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I’ll post a summary shortly. Q: What are you doing to help reduce the pressure on public services in Kent? Sunak says the government is trying to ensure Kent gets the support it needs. He pays tribute to the lobbying done by Natalie Elphicke, the Dover MP. He says the best way to relieve the pressure on Kent is to stop people coming in the first place. That is why the illegal migration bill is so important, he says. Q: It has been very windy on the Channel in recent days, which is why there have been few crossings. Is that why you are here today? Sunak says there are many things he can control, but not the weather. But it is important for him to visit Dover and see what is being done to stop the crossings. He has been before, he says. He says children are being exposed to these dangerous crossings. “That is completely and utterly wrong,” he says. That is why “the moral thing do to and the compassionate thing to do” is to stop the crossings, he says. Q: When you go to Washington, will you be backing Ben Wallace for the next head of Nato? Sunak says Wallace is “widely respected” by other defence ministers. He has done a great job, he says. He says the UK has always been a major contribute to Nato. And he says he thinks the Nato secretary general would agree. Sunak says the government has made more progress on this issue “than anyone has made in a very long time”. Q: Where are the new barges for asylum seekers going? Sunak says that will be announced in due course. But it is important to him to reduce the number of people staying in hotels, he says. He says it is reasonable and fair to expect asylum seekers to share rooms if they are in hotels. Q: Will communities get enough notice of where barges are going? Sunak says the government does engage with local communities. They get funding to help them with costs, and 24-hour security is in place. A barge is being installed in Portland. Two more barges are going to be used, he says. Q: Is there any evidence that your policies are responsible for crossings going down by 20%? Sunak says in the rest of Europe illegal migration arrivals are still going up. That is significant, he says. And he says last year Albania accounted for a third of small boat arrivals, despite it being a safe country. He says the government struck a deal with Albania, and now the number of Albanians crossing the Channel is down 90%. Sunak is now taking questions. Q: Is it credible to say you will stop all the boats? Sunak says he wants to give people the message that his plan is working. Crossings are down by a fifth. That shows the measures are working. He says they are obviously “not there yet”. But people should have confidence, he says. Sunak summarises what he has done over the past six months to make a difference. The UK has worked on this issue with other countries, he says. As a result of the deal with Albania, 1,800 Albanians have been returned to that country, he says. He says he has doubled funding for the National Crime Agency to tackle people smuggling. He says the refusal rate for people claiming to be victims of modern slavery has tripled since requirements were made stricter. Sunak says his message is “our plan is starting to work”. He says that when he announced his plan, at the end of last year, the number of people entering the UK illegally via small boats had quadrupled over the past two years. But now crossings are down 20% compared with last year, he says. And he says this has happened even though the number of migrants entering the rest of Europe illegally has gone up 30% over the same period. Rishi Sunak is about to give his speech in Kent. He will be talking about what he has achieved in the last six months in relation to stopping small boats and reducing illegal immigration. He will also be taking questions from journalists. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Keir Starmer has described the speech Rishi Sunak is due to give later on tackling illegal immigration as “like Groundhog Day”. Speaking on a visit to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, Starmer said: I think everybody wants to make sure that we stop the boats, we don’t want people making that dangerous journey. All we’ve really had from the government though is the announcement of a policy that doesn’t work and then the reannouncement of the same policy, essentially. It often feels, I think, like Groundhog Day and meanwhile that’s costing a fortune for the taxpayer and there’s this growing sense of frustration. Starmer also claimed that illegal immigration was “an ever-growing problem” because the government did not have enough returns agreements with other countries, it was not doing enough to tackle the criminal gangs, and it was not processing asylum claims quickly enough. He said: A deal with Albania is, of course, progress but we need many more returns agreements. Because at the moment the government has baked in a problem, which is because they haven’t got returns agreements with other countries, because they’re not tackling this upstream with cross-border criminal activity being absolutely dealt with, and because they are not processing the claims quickly enough, they are building an ever-growing problem. The Daily Telegraph has today splashed on what seems like a remarkable story. It quotes research claiming that the lockdown measures imposed during the first wave of Covid in 2020 may have saved just 1,700 lives in England and Wales. The report says: Lockdown saved as few as 1,700 lives in England and Wales in spring 2020, according to a landmark study which concludes the benefits of the policy were “a drop in the bucket compared to the staggering collateral costs” imposed. Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Lund University examined almost 20,000 studies on measures taken to protect populations against Covid across the world. It is the reference to Johns Hopkins University that makes this sound particularly authoritative. The School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University is world-renowned, and during the pandemic its Coronavirus Resource Centre was one of the best sources of information about the pandemic. But the report has not actually been produced by the School of Medicine. It has been published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, the libertarian thinktank best known in the UK for inspiring Liz Truss and some of the ideas in her disastrous mini-budget. The report has been written by three people, one of whom, Steve Hanke, is an academic at Johns Hopkins University. But he is an economics professor, not a public health specialist, and he is described in the IEA report as a well-known currency and commodity trader. When Boris Johnson was prime minister, he regularly attacked Labour for its failure to build new nuclear power stations when it was in office. He claimed this was part of the reason for the country’s problem with energy security. On his visit to Hinkley Point C in Somerset this morning, the new nuclear power station that is still not operational, Keir Starmer will claim that it is the Conservative government that is to blame. He will point out that Labour announced outline plans for 10 nuclear reactors in 2009, and that none of them are operational. Here is a Labour list saying what happened to the 10 projects. And here is Ben Quinn and Kiran Stacey’s story about Starmer’s visit. Government WhatsApp groups were never used to make important decisions during Covid and instead relayed information and discussed coffee orders, James Bethell, a former health minister, has argued. Peter Walker has the story here. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is giving a speech in Kent this morning and taking questions from journalists. According to No 10, he will be “deliver an update on his plan to stop the boats and the progress we have made over the last six months” (since he made his statement to MPs in December about his plans to “stop the boats”). But the reporters will have lots of other topics to ask him about, such as his government’s legal action against the Covid inquiry. According to the Daily Telegraph, Sunak will this morning claim that a sharp fall in the number of Albanians coming to the UK to claim asylum shows his plans are working. In their story, Charles Hymas, Daniel Martin and Amy Gibbons report: The prime minister will cite a sharp decline in the number of Albanians arriving as evidence that a tough stance on deportations will deter illegal migrants. The numbers are down from around 30 per cent of Channel arrivals last year to one or two per cent in the first four months of this year. It is understood that thousands of Albanians are being tracked down and targeted by Home Office immigration enforcement officers for deportation, although immigration minister Robert Jenrick admitted on Sunday that the Government had so far only returned hundreds of Albanians who arrived in small boats. A 400-strong team of case workers have also been set up to fast-track a backlog of 16,683 asylum applications by Albanians, and immigration and enforcement officials are pursuing thousands more, many of whom have absconded. But Sunak may find that even people who support what he is trying to do on illegal immigration are not impressed by his progress update. In its story the Daily Mail said the update is likely to be “underwhelming”, and it quotes Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, asking why so few Albanians (“hundreds”, the immigration minister Robert Jenrick said yesterday) have been removed. Duncan Smith said: Is the civil service simply failing to do what it is supposed to have done? We need to have a real reason as to why with a full agreement that people are lauding we haven’t got into priority mode and literally kicked these people out. There needs to be a full explanation from the Home Office as to why this hasn’t happened. And in the Daily Express, which is the Tory paper normally most reluctant to criticise the government, Martyn Brown, the paper’s deputy political editor, says in an analysis that “none of the new measures [announced by Sunak to deal with illegal immigration] have seemingly made a real impact”. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer is visiting the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. 11am: Rishi Sunak holds a press conference in Kent, where he will outline what he views as the progress made in the last six months on tackling illegal migration. 12.15pm: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech to business leaders. 2.30pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday It feels impossible. The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising. However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here. The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates. So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems. “What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.” Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy – burning wood or crops for electricity. It’s no wonder that the UK’s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind. After wind and solar, the biggest prize is stopping the destruction of forests and other wild places, the IPCC scientists found. That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne – half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today. Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer – 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 – as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes. There are some interesting details too. A shift to “sustainable diets” – ie eating much less red meat in rich nations – could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option – burying charcoal in fields (biochar) – is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year. The IPCC chart is a map of climate optimism. It shows we can cut emissions by half by 2030 with options costing at most $100 per tonne, which is a bargain when set against the further damages that climate inaction will inevitably bring. The solutions – wind, solar, trees, energy saving and methane cuts – require no new technology. But what they do require is a resource heavily lacking so far: the political will to push aside vested interests and rapidly pursue the policies that will work. “The chart is a very useful hitlist,” says Blok. “I think every country can take it and see in which areas they could do more. If we don’t achieve [a 50% cut in emissions by 2030], it will not be because of a lack of options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-06T14:20:28Z","webTitle":"Great Britain’s windfarm electricity at record in 2022 but gas up too ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain’s windfarm electricity at record high in 2022 but gas use up too ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Windfarms produced a record amount of Great Britain’s electricity last year, although gas-fired generation also increased, National Grid has said. Figures from the company’s electricity system operator (ESO) showed that wind-powered electricity accounted for 26.8% of generation in 2022, up from 21.9% the year before. In late January last year, wind-powered electricity gained its highest ever share of the energy mix, accounting for 64% of generation. Earlier this week, the ESO said that a new record for wind generation was set on 30 December, when 20.91 gigawatts (GW) were produced by turbines. Renewable energy and nuclear power sources combined to generate 48.5% of Great Britain’s electricity, compared with 40% from gas and coal fossil fuels. The ESO said it was the second greenest year on record, behind only 2020. However, gas-fired power stations, at 38.5%, reached a three-year high as the single largest source of generation during a year in which wholesale gas prices soared as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended international commodity markets. During the Ukraine conflict, countries including the UK have delayed the closure of coal-fired power plants but also created new urgency in developing more renewable energy projects. The ESO said: “The use of coal in our day-to-day energy mix has continued to decline, with coal responsible for only 1.5% of generation in 2022, illustrating the significant reduction that has taken place over the last 10 years, when coal represented 43% of electricity produced in 2012.” Biomass accounted for 5.2% of generation. Demand for power was lowest during the year in the early hours of 12 June, at 15 gigawatts, while the highest demand was recorded on 15 December at 5pm, at 46 gigawatts. That came during a cold snap that put a strain on Britain’s energy systems. National Grid has embarked on the process of reworking electricity networks to better suit renewable power and connect up battery storage sites capable of storing electricity generated by wind and solar farms when the wind isn’t blowing or sun shining. Ministers were forced to scramble last year to ensure back-up power plans were in place for winter in case cold weather or a sudden halt to Russian gas supplies caused power cuts. However, those concerns are fading as recent mild weather and a subsequent fall in wholesale gas prices reflect an improving energy outlook this winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"Nationals push for $10m fines and ability to break up Coles and Woolworths if they abuse market power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","fields":{"headline":"Nationals push for $10m fines and ability to break up Coles and Woolworths if they abuse market power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Littleproud has offered to help Labor bolster competition law protections for farmers and suppliers in a bid to prevent potential abuses of market power by Australia’s big supermarkets. The Nationals leader proposes making the grocery code of conduct compulsory, boosting penalties to a “punitive” $10m maximum and adding powers to break up grocery giants in the event of misconduct. In an interview marking one year of the Albanese government, Littleproud told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that the Nationals are a “sovereign party” that will “do our own thing”. Littleproud revealed he has had “initial talks” with the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, about competition law reforms that the Coalition “were moving to [in government] but were too slow”. “The Nationals wanted to move at a lot quicker pace in terms of a compulsory grocery code. The current penalty on breaching the grocery code, which is voluntary for our big supermarkets, is about $64,000 … That’s a cost of doing business. “Let’s have punitive penalties there, $10m plus divesture powers. I think if Woolies or Coles would lose … [alcohol retail business] Dan Murphy’s because they did the wrong thing by a farmer or by a small supplier, that they’d make sure they’re playing within the guidelines of fair and equitable trade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “Because this is the problem: they have 74% of the retail market. That is a market imbalance and even the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] say that. On Friday, Coles’ supermarkets announced total group sales in the third quarter grew 6.5 per cent to $9.7 billion, with supermarket sales up 7.0 per cent to $8.6b and liquor sales rising 2.6 per cent to $801m. Outgoing CEO Steven Cain attributed the success to Coles’ home brand range, Flybuys points program and weekly special deals. Littleproud said the Nationals would like to work with the government to protect small business. “So I think there’s some reforms there that the Nationals would like to work with the government, to say let’s shift the dial on this, let’s protect small business against big supermarkets. “And it’s only regulatory. So if they’re doing the right thing, Coles, Woolies and Aldi shouldn’t care one iota. “The small supplier and particularly farmers are getting done over and this is where they just need protection. They’re not asking for charity, they’re just asking for a fair price that’s transparent to their cost of production and what it is to get on on to … their shelves and on to your plate.” On Friday the former competition watchdog head Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Leigh said he “[welcomed] bipartisanship in this important area of competition policy” after a decade in which the Coalition presided over “the worst productivity growth in the postwar era”. “As I’ve highlighted in a series of recent speeches, Australia’s economy has become increasingly dominated by a handful of big players,” he said. “Since coming to office, Labor has increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct and banned unfair contract terms. “We’re consulting on banning unfair trading practices and tackling anti-competitive behaviour in specific sectors. We’re also in the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms under the grocery code of conduct.” In a wide-ranging interview, Littleproud said at the 2022 election the Nationals had “lost a lot of voters, and particularly in the cohort of 18- to 54-year-old women and young people”. Littleproud suggested the Nationals could re-engage with these voters by advocating for childcare accessibility, regional health, and committing that “we are serious about net zero and about how we achieve it”. Littleproud echoed opposition leader Peter Dutton’s call for an investigation of small-scale modular nuclear power to help firm electricity from renewables, which the Albanese government has ruled out on cost and feasibility grounds. Littleproud defended the Nationals’ decision to come out in November in opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. In contrast to Dutton’s claims that the voice proposal lacked detail, Littleproud said “the detail has been there for some time about the principle that the prime minister would be putting to the Australian people”. Littleproud argued that Australia doesn’t “need a bigger bureaucracy, you just need a better one” to help narrow the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health and social outcomes. “The thing that I’m most disappointed in all this is that there is no ambitious goal to say, as a nation, that we will have closed the gap by 2030, 2035.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/visual-guide-collapse-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T08:33:08Z","webTitle":"A visual guide to the collapse of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/visual-guide-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/visual-guide-collapse-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam","fields":{"headline":"A visual guide to the collapse of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Where is the dam and what has happened? The dam is located upstream of the city of Kherson on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine. Russia controls the territory on the left bank of the river. The right bank is held by Ukraine. In the early hours of 6 June, the dam collapsed. Before its collapse, the 30-metre-high, 2km-long dam had a road running along its top. It powered the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, a major energy producer, and held back a reservoir containing 18 cubic km of water that supplied communities and agriculture and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control. How serious is the damage and the flooding? Before-and-after satellite images show the extent of the damage to the dam and the adjacent Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which were largely swept away. The collapse sent water cascading downstream, flooding 230 sq miles of territory, according to Ukrainian authorities. This map shows the extent of the flooding as of 7 June. The geography around the river means Russian-controlled areas to the south have been more badly hit. North of Kherson city, the land rises to a plain overlooking the river. To the south is a wide delta with marshes, low-lying islands and flat, sandy levels. Video images from the city of Russian-controlled Nova Kakhovka showed flood waters in the main square rising around the municipal building on 6 June. This footage shows flooding in Korsunka, Dnipriany and Nova Kakhovka – the three settlements immediately downstream of the dam on the Russian-controlled left bank of the river. These before-and-after satellite images show the impact of the flooding on the settlements of Krynky and Oleshky. These images show the flooding of a granary in Nova Kakhovka. What has the humanitarian impact been? At least five people have reportedly died as a result of the floods, a number that is expected to increase. Emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Kherson said on 8 June that up to 14,000 homes had been flooded. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes. Some of those who haven’t left have become stranded on rooftops as the water levels have risen. This drone footage shows water being delivered by air to a family trapped in their house in Oleshky. They were later rescued. Who was responsible? Ukraine has blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion, of blowing it up in an attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Kremlin says Kyiv sabotaged the dam to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. Ukraine’s allies in the west have not directly apportioned blame to Russia, but they have questioned why Kyiv would want to destroy the dam. Engineering experts have said the collapse was most likely caused by a deliberate explosion inside the dam. It is possible that the collapse was made more impactful by the fact that Russia had deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it. How will it affect Ukraine’s counteroffensive? The delta area had been seen as vulnerable for Russian forces in part because of its low elevation. The flooding has put paid – for now at least – to any potential Ukrainian attempt to cross the Dnipro River around Kherson/Nova Kakhovka by widening the barrier separating the two forces. The loss of the road across the top of the dam also deprives Ukraine of a potential line of attack across the river, leaving only the Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson city as a paved river crossing. The flooding may also allow Russian reserves in the south to block any move on Melitopol. And it could free up troop reserves concentrated in the south, allowing them to be directed elsewhere. What is the impact on farming and the environment? In the hours after the collapse, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “a global ecological disaster” was playing out. On 8 June Zelenskiy himself said that 50,000 hectares of forest had been flooded, and that 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. This footage from upstream shows dead and dying fish on the drained bottom of the Nova Kakhovka reservoir on 7 June. There are fears that the depleted reservoir will leave three critical regions in Ukraine’s “bread basket” without a key water supply. A series of canals run from the reservoir, all of which help irrigate swaths of agricultural land. The most significant of these canals are the North Crimean canal, which supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea, and the Kakhovsky canal, which irrigates most of the Kherson region’s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia. Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir taken before the dam collapse shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. Ukraine has warned that agricultural land in these regions could be so heavily affected that they could turn into “deserts”. What is the impact on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? The cooling systems for Europe’s largest nuclear plant are supplied with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. If the dam falls below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there are alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T07:00:56Z","webTitle":"Citizen Nobel review – chemistry prize winner becomes charismatic climate crusader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","fields":{"headline":"Citizen Nobel review – chemistry prize winner becomes charismatic climate crusader","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is an invigorating portrait of one of Europe’s most distinguished scientists, caught at the very point of morphing into a public intellectual and vehement campaigner. In 2017, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet won the Nobel prize in chemistry – jointly with Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Joachim Frank of Columbia in New York – for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, freezing biomolecules in mid-movement and so rendering them visible for the first time; this was a great leap forward for pharmacy and medicine. The snowy-haired Dubochet, who did his important work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg before returning to Lausanne, is shown to be at first bemused and a little flustered by the hordes of excitable photographers who descend on his tranquil campus, clamouring for interviews and demanding a soundbite explanation of his work for the TV news. But Dubochet is no innocent: he was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner in Germany in the “Atomkraft? Nein Danke” era of the 80s, and the film shows it dawning on Dubochet that he can use his new platform to campaign on the new issue that he’s passionate about – the climate crisis. Dubochet thus becomes a participant in climate-strike demos, beaming at young people’s idealism, appearing alongside Greta Thunberg, and becoming enraged at his fellow Swiss for their complacent insularity and at journalists for their supposed neutrality, and failure to report the crisis. He also – just maybe – becomes a little bit intoxicated by his own celebrity, a possibility hinted at during a discussion over the family dinner table. This is a thoroughly worthwhile documentary, although there is one subject I’d like to hear Dubochet address: as an anti-nuke veteran, does he have any time for environmentalists who believe that nuclear power might not be as evil as all that? • Citizen Nobel is released on 16 December on True Story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-01T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"UK energy firms must pass on price savings to customers, ministers warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","fields":{"headline":"UK energy firms must pass on price savings to customers, ministers warn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ministers have warned energy firms that they must pass on the benefits of lower wholesale prices to consumers, amid concern that bills could rise this spring. In a speech on Wednesday, Grant Shapps will tell energy suppliers that reduced wholesale prices must be seen in consumer prices, “no ifs, buts or maybes”. In an apparent sign of government concern about the impact of reduced direct support for domestic energy bills, the energy secretary will spell out his message in a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London. “I have one overriding mission in this new job: for the UK to have amongst the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe,” said Shapps, whose formal brief changed from being business and energy secretary to energy security and net – zero secretary amid a mini-reshuffle and restructuring earlier in February. “This is critical to consumers, to our country and to our planet,” he added. “Making the most of our position as a world-leaders in renewables and nuclear technology, homegrown sources that will shield households from the worst excesses of the volatile global fossil-fuel markets. And suppliers must be ready to pass those savings on to consumers.” Ministers face pressure to postpone the reduction in support for consumer energy bills due in April, given the impact on cost of living pressures. On Monday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, said its energy cap – the amount suppliers can charge for average dual fuel, direct debit customers – would fall by 23% for the three months from 1 April to £3,280, from £4,279 for the January to March quarter. However, the reduction in government help means that the actual price paid by an average household will rise from £2,100 a year in April to £3,000. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months but the drop is yet to feed through into household bills because suppliers buy their energy months in advance. Shapps’ speech, extracts of which were released in advance by his department, will also focus on wider energy security issues, with a pledge that “never again should [Vladimir] Putin or anyone like him even think they can hold the UK to ransom”. The government has promised to invest heavily in domestic-based energy sources, including nuclear power, renewables and some continued fossil fuel extraction. The latter has prompted protest groups to vow to obstruct this, with Shapps due to also promise action to tackle them. “Families have seen the impact on the pounds in their pockets of Putin’s illegal march on Ukraine a year ago – and it has opened the world’s eyes to just how vulnerable we are to tyrants like him,” he will say. “Working towards this overarching goal of cheaper wholesale electricity will mean we will be powering Britain from Britain, increasing our energy security and independence – the kind of independence that comes from having the four biggest windfarms off our shores. “And all this will be better for our planet – energy security and tackling climate change are ultimately two sides of the same coin. And it will be this – not the eco-extremists like Extinction Rebellion causing disruption and dismay – that will have people voting with their feet as they see the benefits of achieving net zero.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T15:25:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 193 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 193 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim. He said homes were damaged, as well as three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, visited Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin. Zelenskiy said Russia was using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, the presidentsaid that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European”. Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Troops’ main grievances probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch. The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for it to carry out the work. The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to his office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T15:12:42Z","webTitle":"Moscow launches new strikes across Ukraine; Kyiv claims Russia has lost 100,000 soldiers in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Moscow launches new strikes across Ukraine; Kyiv claims Russia has lost 100,000 soldiers in Bakhmut – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa.

At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, which is Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported.Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. President Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. NATO air policing units were put on a higher state of readiness following a near-miss between a Russian fighter jet and a Polish aircraft on patrol for the EU’s border agency Frontex on Friday, a NATO official said. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official told Reuters: “NATO air policing detachments were put on higher readiness in response to the dangerous behaviour of a Russian military plane in the vicinity of a Polish Frontex aircraft over the Black Sea near Romania.” The official said NATO “remains vigilant” and referred further questions to the Polish authorities. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported. Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. TASS quoted Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-installed governor, as saying: “We’ve seen the level (of water in the nearby Kakhovka Reservoir) rise to 17.8 metres. “We realise that this is manipulation. The nuclear reactors have been suspended.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. A spokesperson said the measure reflected “the escalation of enemy attacks throughout the country and the downing of a reconnaissance drone in Kryvyi Rih, on Saturday. Moscow has intensified air strikes this month as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. It has also vowed to retaliate after blaming Kyiv for an apparent drone attack on Moscow’s Kremlin citadel, for which Ukraine denied responsibility. In Odesa, flames engulfed what the Ukrainian Red Cross said was a 1,000 sq m food warehouse that it was operating. It said all the humanitarian aid stored there had been destroyed, Reuters reports. After air raid alerts blared for hours over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine, local media said explosions sounded in the southern region of Kherson and southeastern Zaporizhzhia. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in the small city of Orikhiv. The Russian-appointed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, said around 3,000 civilians had been evacuated from areas near the front line that had come under shelling in Zaporizhzhia, one of the areas where Ukraine could launch its counteroffensive. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has shared a photo of a missile attack in Odesa. The time is approaching 6pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news as Russian forces destroyed a Red Cross warehouse in Odesa as part of a wave of strikes that hit several parts of Ukraine. A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement adds. At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, which is Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. President Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said the 1,000 sq metre unit contained humanitarian aid. In a statement it said that workers and volunteers were not in the building at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement adds. Military call-ups are making the most important times of the arable calendar – the sowing and harvesting seasons – even tougher in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The agency has spoken to Kees Huizinga, a Dutch farmer in the Cherkasy region of central Ukraine, who has seen about 40 of his 350 workers sign up to fight in the war, with their replacements lacking experience. Reuters says Huizinga fears this could mean a fall in grain and milk yields – and, with them, a drop in his income. Three other farmers, a major farm operator and an agrarian association told the agency the military call-ups were affecting them too. They said assessing the impact of staff shortages on output is all but impossible – but just another complication in an already difficult campaign. Ukraine’s grain output – for a long time a driver of its export revenues and of global grain markets – is already down sharply because of a war that has disrupted exports, reduced access to fertilisers and made huge swathes of farmland inaccessible. Steps by Kyiv to ringfence the key agriculture sector from the military draft have had only a limited impact, Reuters reports. Most of the farming sources the agency spoke to said they could get by with replacement workers and employees doubling up on some jobs, but that nothing replaces experience. Huizinga said: You lose some efficiency there. You lose the quality. The 48-year-old, who comes from near the Dutch city of Groningen and moved to Ukraine drawn by its cheaper land prices, said the losses could run to a few hundred thousand dollars or more for his farm. On his 15,000 hectares of land, he has milking cattle, plus young stock, and grows a variety of vegetable and grain crops, having withstood unpredictable weather and price fluctuations among other challenges over the years. Kyiv’s mayor says Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones at Ukrainian targets, including 36 at the capital, all of which were shot down. However, he said debris hit flats and other buildings, injuring at least five people on the ground. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson on Monday, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. Two others were hurt in Antonivka, on Kherson’s outskirts, said military administration chief Roman Mrochko. The two people in Antonivka had been near one of the many “invincibility points” that Ukraine set up nationwide to provide access to electricity, heating, water and other basic services for civilians facing outages caused by Russian airstrikes. Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Kherson last November after nearly eight months of occupation by Russian forces who seized it soon after launching their full-scale invasion. The area now comes under frequent artillery fire from Russian forces dug in on the opposite side of the Dnieper River. Russia has effectively stopped the Black Sea grain deal by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry has said. “The Russian Federation once again effectively stopped the ‘grain initiative’ by refusing to register incoming vessels and carry out their inspections. This approach contradicts the terms of the current agreement,” the ministry said in a statement according to Reuters. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Cherevaty said that Russia had launched about 415 artillery strikes in the last 24 hours. He added that 64 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday. Cherevaty also said that Russia did not seem to be low on ammunition, despite claims to the contrary by the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. “Such statements by the Wagner group leader are most likely connected with the fact that he made too many promises about the capture of Bakhmut and invents this nonsense about ammo shortage since, apart from manpower losses, he has no other ‘victories.’” Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorist offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion on Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. A court remanded him in custody for two months. Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Ukraine and the western states of backing it, particularly the US, for the attack. Ukraine’s security services neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he believed Russian authorities staged the attack. The US state department has not commented on the incident. Russia’s state news agency TASS quoted security sources as saying the suspect was a “native of Ukraine” with a past conviction for robbery with violence. Prilepin was the third prominent pro-war figure to be targeted by a bomb since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia also blamed Ukraine for the deaths of journalist Darya Dugina and war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in the two previous attacks. Kyiv has denied involvement. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced on Monday. The visit on Europe Day reaffirms “the EU’s unwavering support towards the country”, a spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters. “The visit will focus on all the dimensions of our relations with Ukraine,” he added. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. This would mean imposing restrictions on the sale of certain goods to that country if it was believed they were being re-exported to Russia. The plans, which will be subject to intense discussion from EU member states, could yet be watered down amid concern about pushing sanction-targeted countries into the arms of the Kremlin. Since the EU and western allies imposed heavy sanctions on the Russian economy after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc’s exports to its eastern neighbour have fallen sharply. But EU trade with former Soviet countries in the Caucasus and central Asia has jumped, as have some of these countries’ onward exports to Russia – a process called “the Eurasian roundabout” by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has studied the issue. At the same time, Turkey and China have also increased their sales to Russia. EU diplomats are wary of antagonising these countries and pushing them closer to Russia, but there is also understanding that the continued flow of exports is blunting the impact of western sanctions. The issue is the centrepiece of the EU’s 11th round of sanctions against Russia, which otherwise contains few substantial measures. Some EU diplomats argue the EU has little left to sanction, with contentious issues – such as a ban on Russian diamonds and civil nuclear technology – too difficult to agree among the 27 member states. The EU also wants to impose personal sanctions – asset freezes and travel bans – on a further 72 people and 29 organisations deemed to be supporting the war effort. On the draft list are people putting out the Kremlin line on state TV, those responsible for the transportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and two commanders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, who were recently found guilty in absentia by a Dutch court for the murder of 298 people on board Flight MH17 in 2014, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are moving members of the local authority, collaborators, children and teachers from the city of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia to the city of Berdiansk, which is also under Russian control. Parents have been told not to enrol the children into schools if they have refused the evacuation order, according to the General Staff of Ukraine’s daily update. Meanwhile, queues for petrol are in place, with drivers in Tokmak told that no new deliveries are planned. Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Speaking to the nation on a hill overlooking Kyiv, Zelenskiy compared Putin’s Russia to Hitler’s Germany, saying the Kremlin was pursuing “enslavement and destruction”, as the Nazis did, Reuters reports. He said Russia would not succeed. Further cementing Ukraine’s break with its Soviet past, Zelenskiy said he had submitted a bill to parliament officially making 8 May a day of remembrance and victory, while 9 May – when Russia marks Victory Day – would become Europe Day. “We are returning to our state an honest history without ideological influences. It is on 8 May that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis,” he said in a video posted on the president’s Telegram channel. “Today, I signed the relevant decree, and every year from tomorrow, 9 May, we will commemorate our historic unity – the unity of all Europeans who destroyed Nazism and will defeat Ruscism,” he said, using a word Ukrainians have coined to describe what they call Russian fascism. About eight Kh-22 cruise missiles were fired by Russia at Odesa overnight according to Ukraine’s air force spokesperson. Yurii Ihnat said that “some of them did not reach their targets”, the Kyiv Independent reported, as Ihnat spoke on television. He said that they were older Soviet missiles. Despite their apparent age, Russia used the same missile in an attack that hit a residential building in Dnipro on 14 January, killing 40 civilians and injuring over 70. Ukraine’s air force earlier reported that Russian forces had attacked Odesa using Tu-22 M3 long-range bombers from Cape Tarkhankut in Russian-occupied Crimea. The warehouse of a food company and a recreational area on the Black Sea coast were hit, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. No casualties were reported. Russian military recruiters have been targeting central Asian migrant workers in Russia to serve in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Recruiters have visited mosques and immigration offices to recruit. At immigration offices, staff who speak Tajik and Uzbek routinely attempt to recruit migrants. Radio Free Europe reported recruiters offering sign-up bonuses of USD $2,390 and salaries of up to USD $4,160 a month. Migrants have also been offered a fast-track Russian citizenship path of six months to one year, instead of the usual five years. The high monthly salary and sign-up bonuses will entice some migrant workers to sign up. These recruits are likely sent to the Ukrainian frontlines where the casualty rate is extremely high. Recruiting migrants is part of the Russian ministry of defence’s attempts to fulfil its target of 400,000 volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The authorities are almost certainly seeking to delay any new overt mandatory mobilisation for as long as possible to minimise domestic dissent. More photos have emerged of the damage done after Russia launched drone strikes on Kyiv overnight: Russia appears to have ramped up its attacks on Ukraine ahead of its annual Victory Day parade in Moscow on Tuesday, which marks the anniversary of Soviet Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. The celebration has gradually emerged as the centrepiece of Vladimir Putin’s vision of Russian identity over his 23 years in charge. But this year there are signs of unease among the Russian leadership over the celebrations amid fears of Ukrainian strikes, the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer reports from Moscow, after drones operated by unknown people attacked the Kremlin last week. “There is a nervousness that I have never seen before,” said one official at the Moscow mayor’s office. “But Victory Day has to go ahead, there is no other option.” Some images of the damage from last night’s strikes on Ukraine, in which five people were injured in Kyiv. A bit more from the ISW update I posted about earlier. The thinktank’s analysts argue that the latest spat between Wagner and the Russian ministry of defence shows that army Gen Valery Gerasimov, overall campaign commander in Ukraine, and possibly minister of defence Sergei Shoigu “lack the ability to command [Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and [Chechen leader Ramzan] Kadyrov as subordinates but must instead negotiate with them as peers”. The ISW writes further: Gerasimov’s degraded abilities to control his commanders will likely further limit the Russian military’s ability to conduct coherent operations involving different areas of responsibility … ISW has previously assessed that factional dynamics within the Russian military are shaping decision-making to an unusual degree, and the increasing erosion of the Russian chain of command is likely caught in a self-reinforcing feedback loop with the Russian military’s growing factionalism. ISW assesses that Putin is unlikely to remove Gerasimov as overall theatre commander for reputational reasons, and therefore Prigozhin’s and Kadyrov’s public undermining of Gerasimov may have lasting impacts on the power of the overall theatre commander’s position. Prominent pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Writing on Telegram on Sunday, the Russian nationalist said he had been driving and that his assistant was in the passenger seat when the bomb blew up under his assistant’s wheel. Prilepin said he had dropped his daughter off just five minutes before the explosion. “I tell the demons: you will not intimidate anyone. God exists. We will win,” he added at the end of his post. Ukraine says it destroyed all 35 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia in a wave of attacks across the country early Monday. In its usual morning update the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said Russia had also launched 16 missile strikes on cities and regions including Kharkiv, Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa as well as 61 airstrikes. It also reported 52 instances of enemy shelling and said “Unfortunately, there are killed and wounded among civilians, damaged high-rise building, private residences and other civilian infrastructures.” “The probability of further Russian missile and air strikes across Ukraine remains high,” it added. We’re going to pause the blog here for a couple of hours but will of course return to bring you any breaking news. Here are the latest developments: Five people have been injured in Kyiv after Russia launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday. Two of those were wounded when drone wreckage fell on a two-storey building in the city’s west, while drone debris also fell on the runway at the city’s the Zhuliany airport. Explosions were also reported in the Black Sea city of Odesa, where Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said a food warehouse and a recreation area had been set on fire. Further Russian strikes were also reported in Zaporizhzhia and in the southern region of Kherson. Russian Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying he has been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Kadyrov was happy to help Prigozhin in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin, it argued. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, according to UK intelligence. More from that ISW report I mentioned earlier: the analysis suggests that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov was happy to help Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin “blackmail” the Russian defence ministry in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin. The think tank writes: Kadyrov had previously held an influential position within … Putin’s close circle … until apparently losing favor recently, likely because his forces played a limited role in active combat operations in Ukraine throughout late fall of 2022 and winter of 2023. Putin belittled Kadyrov during their meeting on March 13 where Kadyrov appeared visibly nervous when reporting on the Chechen fighters’ role in Ukraine. Kadyrov likely saw Prigozhin’s threats to withdraw from Bakhmut as an opportunity to play up the effectiveness of his forces against the backdrop of Gerasimov’s and Shoigu’s failures to deliver decisive victories during the winter-spring offensive. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed local official in Zaporizhzhia, said that Russian forces overnight also hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in Orikhiv, a small city in the region, Reuters reported. The news wire was not able to independently verify the report. Russia has launched a string of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks, killing dozens of people across the country. Targets have included civilian areas: eight people died in a supermarket in Kherson last week and 23 people, including a baby boy, were killed in the city of Uman when a Russian missile struck an apartment block at the end of April. Russian missiles were also aimed at Odesa, hitting a food warehouse and a “recreation area”, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. He wrote on Telegram: X-22 rockets were directed at the warehouse of one of the food enterprises and at the recreation area on the Black Sea coast. Rescuers are working to eliminate fires. There was no information about the victims. The information is being clarified. More detail on the strikes on Kyiv from Reuters, which reports: Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell onto the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. The Kyiv’s military administration said that drone wreckage fell on a runway of the Zhuliany airport, one of the two passenger airports of the Ukrainian capital, causing no fire, but emergency services were working on the site. It also said that in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district, drone debris seemed to have hit a two-storey building, causing damages. There was no immediate information about potential casualties. Reuters’ witnesses said they had heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It was not immediately clear how many drones were launched on Kyiv. The ISW analysis comes after Reuters reported that Wagner group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had ditched his plans to withdraw from the eastern city of Bakhmut on Sunday after receiving promises that his fighters would receive as much ammunition as they needed. Prigozhin wrote on Telegram: Overnight we received a combat order, for the first time in all this time. We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off [from supplies] will be deployed on the flank. Prigozhin had announced on Friday that his fighters, who have spearheaded the months-long assault on Bakhmut, would pull out because he said his men had been starved of ammunition and taken “useless and unjustified” losses as a result. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. The US-based think tank writes: Kadyrov published a letter on May 6 asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to order Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Director of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvadia) Viktor Zolotov to authorize the transfer of Chechen “Akhmat” units from “other directions” to assume Wagner’s positions in the Bakhmut direction. Kadyrov’s letter to Putin bypassed the Russian chain of command, and the withdrawal of Chechen forces from other parts of the theater likely posed a risk to Russian defensive lines, a risk that [Army General Valery] Gerasimov and Shoigu, or Putin, appear to have been unwilling to take. Kyiv’s local council has sounded the all-clear after Russia carried out strikes on the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday. “Please keep an eye on reports and return to shelter if the siren sounds again,” the city’s administration wrote on Telegram. The strikes come as Russian forces begin evacuating people from the Russian-occupied area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, with more than 1,600 people, including 660 children, evacuated so far, Reuters reported, citing a Moscow-installed local official. Ukraine is soon expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region and on Saturday the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned that the situation around the plant had become “potentially dangerous”. In its morning update on Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces were evacuating local Russian passport-holders. “The first to be evacuated are those who accepted Russian citizenship in the first months of the occupation,” it said in a statement. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. Five people have been injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a fresh assault across Ukraine in the early hours of Monday, with explosions reported in the capital as well as in the Black Sea city of Odesa and in the southern region of Kherson. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three people were injured in the city’s Solomyanskyi district and two others injured when drone wreckage fell on to at two-storey building in the Sviatoshyn district. “Likely as a result of debris falling on a parked car in the yard of a residential building, the car caught fire,” the city’s military administration added in a post on Telegram. “There is a recorded fall of debris on a residential building.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone. At least five people have been wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Monday, city officials have said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were also injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Sviatoshyn, on the western edge of Kyiv, is a historical neighbourhood of the capital. Witnesses said they have heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It comes amid fears for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, as Russia evacuates 1,679 people, including 660 children, from areas nearby. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, warned at the weekend that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” as Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas. Ukraine is expected to start soon a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Other key developments: An explosion was also heard overnight following a missile attack that hit the Black Sea city of Odesa, a local Ukrainian official said, and Ukrainian media reported sounds of explosions in the southern region of Kherson. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, according to UK intelligence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T10:50:32Z","webTitle":"Situation at Zaporizhzhia plant ‘perilous’, UN warns | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: situation at Zaporizhzhia plant ‘perilous’, UN warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said yesterday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on 9 March, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. What else is happening? President Vladimir Putin’s ally Dmitry Medvedev has said this morning that any attempt to arrest Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for him would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. US navy rejects China claim that warship ‘illegally’ entered part of South China Sea The US has denied Chinese claims that a US destroyer was driven out from waters around the contested Paracel Islands after it “illegally” entered the area in the South China Sea. In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese military said the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius illegally intruded into China’s territorial waters without the approval of the government, undermining peace and stability in the busy waterway. The US navy, however, said this was false. “The USS Milius is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea and was not expelled. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” a statement from the US Navy 7th Fleet said. Where are the Paracel Islands? They are a disputed archipelago spread across about 7 sq km in the South China Sea. China has de facto control of the islands and has built installations and outposts, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim ownership. What did the US say? The US’s Indo-Pacific Command at the time said China’s statement was “false” and that the US ship was conducting a freedom of navigation operation (Fonop) in line with international law. The Fonop sought to challenge restrictions imposed by various parties – including China, Taiwan and Vietnam – on “innocent passage” through the disputed area, and to challenge China’s claim of straight baselines that enclose the Paracel Islands. Trump lawyer ordered to hand over notes in Mar-a-Lago documents inquiry Donald Trump’s main lawyer – who was involved in turning over classified-marked documents at the Mar-a-Lago resort to the justice department last year – must provide his notes and audio transcripts to the criminal investigation into the former president after a federal appeals court rejected two efforts to block the order. The US appeals court for the DC circuit rejected on Wednesday two separate appeals from the former president and his lawyer Evan Corcoran to stop a sealed order, piercing attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine protections issued in a court decision last week. In losing the appeal – a major defeat for Trump – Corcoran must provide additional testimony and produce documents to the grand jury hearing evidence about Trump’s potential unauthorized retention of national security materials at Mar-a-Lago, and possible obstruction of justice. The obstruction part of the investigation is centered on Trump’s incomplete compliance with a subpoena in May that demanded the return of any classified-marked documents in his possession. That was after documents he returned earlier to the National Archives included 200 that were classified. What is happening in the Dominion case? The full trial in the case is scheduled to begin on 17 April but one side may have won already, argues Sam Levine. The core of Dominion’s $1.6bn case against Fox consists of words that came from the mouths of Fox’s employees. Regardless of what happens in the case, Dominion may have already won: the messages offer a significant historical record of how top officials at one of the country’s most powerful media organizations aired information they knew was false when US democracy was under attack.

Stat of the day: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates a quarter-point amid banking turmoil Facing the worst banking crisis since 2008 and the highest inflation rate in a generation, the Federal Reserve chose to keep fighting price rises and announced another hike in interest rates. The US central bank announced yesterday that its benchmark interest rate would rise another quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% – its ninth consecutive rate rise and the highest rate since 2007. A year ago interest rates were close to zero. The latest increase was smaller than the half-point increase that some had expected before a series of bank collapses shook global markets. In a statement, the Fed said the impact of the banking crisis was “uncertain” but that inflation “remains elevated”.

How traumatic will those first mouthfuls be? It should be perfectly obvious to everyone that bananas are repulsive, writes Arwa Mahdawi. They’re mushy, they’re musty, they’re alarmingly yellow. I wouldn’t go so far as to say I have bananaphobia (a rare but real condition), but for a long time I was so nauseated by the fruit that you couldn’t have paid me a million dollars to touch one.

Climate check: new climate paper calls big US oil firms to be charged with homicide Oil companies have come under increasing legal scrutiny and face allegations of defrauding investors, racketeering and a wave of other lawsuits. But a new paper argues there’s another way to hold big oil accountable for climate damage: trying companies for homicide. The striking and seemingly radical legal theory is laid out in a paper accepted for publication in the Harvard Environmental Law Review. In it, the authors argue fossil fuel companies “have not simply been lying to the public, they have been killing members of the public at an accelerating rate, and prosecutors should bring that crime to the public’s attention”. “What’s on their ledger in terms of harm … there’s nothing like it in human history,” said David Arkush, one of the paper’s authors. Last Thing: Virginia prisoners who used toothbrush to escape caught at pancake restaurant Two prisoners in Virginia managed to escape their cell by digging a hole through a wall with the aid of a toothbrush, but were apprehended within a few hours after being tempted to visit a pancake restaurant. In a statement, the Newport News sheriff’s office said two inmates were reported missing after a routine head count at about 7pm on Monday at the Newport News jail. Staff discovered that John Garza, 37, and Arley Nemo, 43, had dug a hole through a jail wall using “primitive-made tools” fashioned from a toothbrush and metal objects. They then scaled a high prison wall and made their escape. However, the two men were quickly found after being spotted by members of the public at an Ihop, a branch of the pancake chain whose name is short for International House of Pancakes.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. Zelenskiy said “hundreds of thousands of people have been left without normal access to drinking water” in a social media message on Wednesday morning. In a read-out from a ministerial meeting, Zelenskiy said the evacuation of people and the urgent provision of drinking water were top priorities. He also accused the occupying Russian authorities in southern Kherson on the left bank of the Dnipro of failing in their duty to evacuate residents, and said Ukraine would appeal to international organisations to assist those people. The governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, says that 1,582 houses have been flooded on the right bank of the Dnipro River and some 1,457 people have been evacuated overnight. Relief workers on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the river have reported having to work under fire. “The biggest difficulty right now is not the water. It’s the Russians on the other side of the river who are shelling us now with artillery,” said Andrew Negrych, who was coordinating relief efforts for a US charity, Global Empowerment Mission, on Tuesday. The Russian-imposed mayor of Nova Kakhovka in occupied Kherson, the nearest settlement to the dam, has said seven people are missing and up to 100 people are still trapped, and has claimed that a Ukrainian drone struck during evacuation efforts. Tass reports that Russian occupying forces in the Kherson region have set up “40 temporary accommodation centres … in which there are 345 people. The rest of the evacuees stayed with relatives and friends”. It also quotes Russia’s ministry of emergency situations saying that “a group of 350 rescuers is ready to work in the Kherson region”. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible, national security council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House. “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, he said noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told the UN security council that “the sheer magnitude of the catastrophe will only become fully realised in the coming days.” “But it’s already clear that it will have grave and far-reaching consequences for thousands of people in southern Ukraine on both sides of the frontline through the loss of homes, food, safe water and livelihoods,” he added. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he “does not understand” how there could be any doubt that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” Yermak also reported that two people have been killed in a drone attack in Sumy on Wednesday morning. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted a situational update in which he says two people were killed yesterday in the region by Russian shelling. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, has used his Telegram channel to post a video of bodycam combat footage from a forest, with the message that “the defence forces continue to move forward on the flanks, the enemy loses positions near Bakhmut.” Russia has detained a resident in its far east on suspicion of spying for Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday, citing the Federal Security Service (FSB). Two towns in Russia’s western Kursk region lost electricity and a man was wounded on Wednesday after Ukraine dropped explosives on an electricity substation near the border overnight, the region’s governor said. Maria Zakharova, official spokesperson of the Russian foreign ministry, has said that the government in Kyiv could not survive for “a hundredth of a second” without the support of the west, and claimed Ukraine was “blackmailing the world community”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant 200km downstream from the dam, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-273-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-23T01:05:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 273 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-273-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-273-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 273 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dozens of Russian missiles were reportedly launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country as Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, urged people to stay in shelters. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” following Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday on Russia’s latest strikes at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” and that the country will rebuild damaged infrastructure and “get through all of this”. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures in which parts of the capital would have to be evacuated, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding the the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyberattacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Germany has angrily dismissed claims by Boris Johnson that in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine it said it would be better for Ukraine to fold than to become embroiled in a long war. Johnson, interviewed by CNN, also claimed that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in denial about the threat of invasion, and that Italy, led at the time by Mario Draghi, said it could not help because it was so dependent on Russian hydrocarbons. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians needing basic services if Russia knocks out power stations and other facilities this winter can turn to special “invincibility centres,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Thousands of centres spread across the country will offer electricity, heat, water, internet service, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock. “If massive Russian strikes happen again and it’s clear power will not be restored for hours, the ‘invincibility centres’ will go into action with all key services,” Zelenskiy said. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Kyiv will summon the Hungarian ambassador to protest that prime minister Viktor Orbán went to a football match wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda said depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T17:54:01Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: anyone supporting Moscow in conflict is an ‘accomplice’, Macron says during China visit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: anyone supporting Moscow in conflict is an ‘accomplice’, Macron says during China visit – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Military honours, tributes and praise welcomed Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, to Poland on Monday. Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw by President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Poland would send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. Poland has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, met Russian officials in Kaliningrad on Wednesday for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland on Wednesday, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting on Wednesday evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. France’s president Emmanuel Macron has warned that anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. It would be “very hard” to lift Russia’s suspension from UEFA until the war in Ukraine ends, the president of the European football governing body has said. Aleksander Čeferin, at a news conference in Lisbon, said: My personal opinion is: that, until the war stops, it will be very hard for us to change anything. Both UEFA and world football’s governing body, FIFA, suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions in February 2022. Footage being shared on social media shows a small plume of black smoke rising from the Russian defence ministry’s headquarters following state media reports that a fire has broken out at the building in the centre of Moscow. There have been no details on any casualties or the cause of the fire. A fire has broken out at a building belonging to Russia’s defence ministry in the centre of Moscow, the Russian state-run Tass new agency is reporting, citing emergency services. More details to follow. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s official visit to Poland. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, has arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting this evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The pair will also discuss “the international situation and the measures being taken to ensure security”, Belta said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. Moscow and Beijing issued the joint statement following talks between Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the Russian capital last month. In the statement, both countries said it was necessary to halt actions that further fuelled the conflict in Ukraine. Just days later, Putin said Moscow had reached an agreement with Minsk to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters at Nato’s headquarters in Brussels today, said the Russian leader’s announcement followed Moscow and Beijing jointly declaring countries should not deploy nuclear weapons outside their borders. He said this showed such statements are “empty promises and what we need to watch closely is what Russia is doing”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainian grain until June 2024. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s state-run RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. The United States is working through the process to determine if Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich’s detention by Russia is “wrongful”, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, adding that it would soon be completed. “It’s something that we’re working through very deliberately, but expeditiously as well. And I’ll let that process play out. In my own mind, there’s no doubt that he’s being wrongfully detained by Russia,” Reuters reports Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that explosions have been heard in Kherson. US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Wednesday she had spoken with her Russian counterpart Vassily Nebenzia to demand the immediate release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week. Reuters reports Thomas-Greenfield said she spoke with Nebenzia on Tuesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. He said: We are in Bakhmut and the enemy does not control it. He added: For me, the most important is not to lose our soldiers and of course if there is a moment of even hotter events and the danger we could lose our personnel because of encirclement – of course the corresponding correct decisions will be taken by generals there. The more ammunition Kyiv receives from western partners, the faster it would be able fight back in Bakhmut and elsewhere, he added: There is success in some districts of Bakhmut – we’re going forward. Or there’s no (success) and we’re again leaving for positions. Vladimir Putin has attended a ceremony at the Kremlin where he met the new ambassadors to Moscow and accepted their diplomatic credentials. Among the 17 new ambassadors attending the ceremony on Wednesday was Lynne Tracy, the US’s new ambassador to Russia. Putin told Tracy in an address that US support for a revolution in Ukraine in 2014 had led to the current situation where Russia and Ukraine were in conflict. Relations with Washington were in a deep crisis that was “based on fundamentally different approaches to the formation of the modern world order”, the Russian leader said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has met Russian officials in Kaliningrad for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. An IAEA spokesperson said earlier this week that Grossi would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday to discuss the safety of the nuclear plant, which is near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Here’s more from Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who said he would discuss developments in the Ukraine war with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to Turkey this week. Ankara is working with the UN to solve issues regarding grain and fertiliser exports via the Black Sea, Çavuşoğlu added. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Poland for an official visit to a close ally that has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw with military honours, tributes and praise from President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Duda told Zelenskiy that he was a“unique man” and that he had “no doubt that your attitude, together with the bravery of the nation, has saved Ukraine”. Poland will send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy: Four MiG-29s that remained in storage have been handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces in recent months. Four MiGs are now being given, so eight in total.. We are ready... to give six more that are currently being prepared. We assume they could be transferred soon. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. He said: You have not abandoned Ukraine, you stood with us shoulder to shoulder, and we are grateful to you. We believe this is a historic relationship. The visit – Zelenskiy’s first official visit to Poland since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 – stood out from his previous visits to the US, Britain, France and Belgium because it was announced in advance, without the secrecy of past trips. It is also unusual because the Ukrainian president is joined by his wife. Poland has taken in more than a million Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded, and has played an instrumental role in persuading other western powers to supply battle tanks and other weaponry to Ukraine. It was also the first country to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine. During his visit, Zelenskiy is expected to meet with Duda and Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and sign bilateral agreements. Polish officials had previously said talks would focus on developments on the Ukrainian front lines, international support and economic cooperation. Zelenskiy will also speak to Ukrainian refugees and Polish members of the public as well as business leaders who could be involved in rebuilding Ukraine. Here’s more from President Emmanuel Macron, who has arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit. Speaking to journalists, the French leader said anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. Macron said: We have decided since the beginning of the conflict to help the victim, and we have also made it very clear that anyone helping the aggressor would be an accomplice in breach of international law. He added that it was not in China’s interest to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine: China’s interest isn’t to have a lasting war. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has awarded his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the Order of the White Eagle during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Warsaw. The order is “the oldest and highest Polish award” and is presented to “outstanding individuals,” Duda said at the ceremony. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said Sweden needs to take further steps for Ankara to ratify its Nato membership bid. Çavuşoğlu also told reporters that he had discussed Sweden’s Nato bid and developments regarding Ankara’s purchase of F-16 fighter jets with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Çavuşoğlu and Blinken met on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, on the day that Finland formally joined the military alliance. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said China can play a “major role” in the war in Ukraine because of its close relationship with Russia. Macron, speaking shortly after he landed in Beijing for a state visit, said maintaining dialogue with China was essential and that Moscow could not be allowed to have an exclusive dialogue with Beijing. He told reporters at the French embassy in Beijing: We hear increasingly loud voices expressing a strong concern about the future of relations between the west and China that in some form lead to the conclusion that there is an inescapable spiral of mounting tensions. The French leader, who touched down ahead of the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is on his first trip to China since 2019 and hopes to refute any sense of an “inescapable spiral” of tension between Beijing and the west. Both Macron and Von der Leyen have said they want to persuade China to use its influence over Russia to bring peace in Ukraine, or at least prevent Beijing from directly supporting Moscow.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is visiting Poland, while Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen are in China. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The first images have arrived of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Warsaw where he and his wife, Olena Zelenska, have met Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and his wife, Agata Kornhauser-Duda. Turkish coastguards were searching for nine missing crew members of a Ukraine-bound commercial ship that sank close to Turkey’s southern province of Antalya. The Guinea Bissau-flagged ship had sailed from Turkey’s Iskenderun port for Ukraine’s Izmail port, the coast guard said. Reuters report five crew members were rescued by helicopters and other ships passing by the area, it said in a statement. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. Spain last month said it expected to send the tanks after the 9 April Easter holiday. It had committed to sending a total of ten tanks to Ukraine, and Reuters reports Robles said the armed forces had started repairing the remaining four. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. “As it is clear that this demand will not be met by the European Commission at this point, I decided to resign from the post of agriculture minister,” Kowalczk said. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. Reuters reports the prime ministers of five states including Poland wrote to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday to demand action on Ukrainian agricultural imports. They said tariffs may have to be reintroduced if the influx of grain and other products from Ukraine cannot be stopped by other means. Reuters has a quick snap to report that Polish agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk will resign from his post amid rising anger among farmers over the impact of Ukrainian grain imports on prices. The move coincides with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visiting Poland, a trip which some farmers have threatened to disrupt. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing Ukrainian troops in Donetsk oblast. French president Emmanuel Macron is currently arriving at Beijing airport for his state visit to China. The UK’s Ministry of Defence’s intelligence briefing about the Ukraine war today concentrates on the finances of the Russian state. The UK suggests that Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin’s recent announcement that “a move to issuing some of Russia’s sovereign debt in foreign currencies was ‘under development’” indicates that Russia is anticipating financial support from other countries, which could go to help support the war effort. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday at the Nato summit in Brussels that the defence alliance needs to strengthen its relations with global like-minded partners. After Finland joined Nato yesterday, the Nato summit in Vilnius in July should welcome Sweden to the alliance, Reuters reports Baerbock added.

The regional authority in Ukraine’s Sumy oblast has reported that the night passed without any shelling, according to Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster. After more than 1,200 days in charge of the European Commission, which forms and enforces policy for 450 million Europeans, Ursula von der Leyen is in the final third of her term. It has been a tumultuous period: she took office in 2019 with ambitious pledges to tackle the climate emergency, but was soon confronted by a once-a-century pandemic and the biggest war on European soil since 1945. In previous crises “the EU realised that it is still very much a legislative machine, and there was no headquarters, no general to lead the crisis management”, said one senior EU official. “Now in two consecutive crises, Covid and Ukraine, we have the headquarters and we have the general.” As Von der Leyen heads to China, read our profile of the EU Commission president: A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. According to the Russian military officer cited by RIA, a Polish-made drone weighing more than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) had crashed near the plant. The news agency did not say when. Grossi has been pushing for a demilitarised zone around Europe’s largest nuclear facility, which has come under repeated shelling, with Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has crossed the border and is now in Poland ahead of his official visit to the capital Warsaw, the Polish president’s foreign policy adviser said on Wednesday. “I can say that President Zelenskiy has crossed the Polish border,” Marcin Przydacz told private broadcaster TVN24. We’ll have more shortly. More now on Zelenskiy’s trip to Poland: The Polish public overwhelming supports Ukrainians in their war with Russia. An Ipsos poll said 82% of Poles think Nato and EU countries should back Ukraine until it wins. Nonetheless, Zelenskiy’s visit takes place amid mounting anger in rural Poland over the impact of imports of Ukrainian grain, which have pushed down prices in several states in the EU’s eastern wing. “During talks with President Zelenskiy, we will certainly discuss Ukrainian grain and various agricultural products, because we want any trade with Ukraine not to destabilise our market,” Morawiecki said. Tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural imports may need to be reintroduced if an influx of products pushing down prices in EU markets can’t be halted by other means, the premiers of five eastern states said in a letter published on Friday to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Washington unveiled $2.6bn more in military assistance for Zelenskiy’s government on Tuesday, including three air surveillance radars, anti-tank rockets and fuel trucks. The Russian embassy in Washington reacted to the announcement by accusing the United States of wanting to drag out the conflict as long as possible, Russian news agency TASS said. The United States has pledged more than $35.2bn worth of security assistance since the start of the war. European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron land in China today, where they will be hoping to “reset” ties with an important economic partner while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. Macron last visited China in 2019 while it will be Von der Leyen’s first trip since becoming European Commission president that year. Since then, China’s strict pandemic controls forced all diplomatic meetings online as relations with Europe soured: first due to a stalled investment pact in 2021 and then Beijing’s refusal to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Macron’s adviser said was an attempt to “reset” diplomatic and economic relations with China. “It’s not the time to announce business deals or big new investments,” said Noah Barkin, an analyst with Rhodium Group. “It would essentially be a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy and send the message that France is not on board with the US approach.” Von der Leyen has said the EU must cut risks in ties with Beijing, including limiting Chinese access to sensitive technology and reducing reliance for key inputs such as critical minerals, as well as batteries, solar panels and other clean tech products. Macron invited Von der Leyen on the trip as a way to project European unity, after French officials criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for going solo to China late last year. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. “The visit will take place at the invitation of President (Andrzej) Duda. There will be long, broad talks, not only about the security situation, but also about economic and political support”, Przydacz told private radio RMF. “It will be an official visit.” He added Zelenskiy would meet Poles and Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Poland on Wednesday at Warsaw’s Castle square. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. Poland is Ukraine’s neighbour and the two countries have deep historical ties. Many Ukrainians fled their country after Russia’s invasion last year, with a large number seeking safety in Poland. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. French president Emmanuel Macron and European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen arrive in China on Wednesday seeking to “reset” ties while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday held a call with Macron to discuss the visit, the White House said, adding that they also spoke about maintaining support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Here are the other key recent developments: Finland has become the 31st member of Nato after its foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, signed an accession document and handed it to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, at a ceremony in Brussels. Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, said the accession of Finland increased the risks of wider conflict. US president Joe Biden welcomed Finlands’ ascension and urged Turkey and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes for Sweden to join. Ukraine hopes to receive two more tranches worth $1.8bn from the International Monetary Fund this year under its newly approved four-year lending program, top Ukrainian central bank officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine this week received the first $2.7bn tranche under the program, which is a part of a bigger $115bn global package of support. Britain has blocked the UN webcast of an informal Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, at which Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights is due to speak. The international criminal court wants to arrest the commissioner on war crimes charges. Such meetings are not held in the Security Council chamber and all 15 council members have to agree to allow it to be webcast by the United Nations. The US is trying to wreck Russia’s planned summit with African countries as part of efforts to isolate Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Moscow is preparing for its second summit with African countries, scheduled for the end of July in St Petersburg. A Ukrainian soldier pleaded “partly guilty” on Tuesday at Russia’s first trial for war crimes in connection with its military campaign in Ukraine. Russian investigators formally charged Darya Trepova, a 26-year-old woman, with terrorism offences over the killing of the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a bomb blast in St Petersburg. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week, met his lawyers for the first time on Tuesday, editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a message to staff. “Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, will travel to Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has said. Lithuania’s parliament decided on Tuesday to ban Russian nationals from purchasing real estate in the Baltic country, citing risks to national security. Polish farmers are threatening to derail a visit to Warsaw by Volodymyr Zelenskiy over claims that Ukrainian grain is flooding their market, in a move that would provide Russia with valuable evidence of a crack in western solidarity. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency has reported that the number of people injured in the St Petersburg cafe explosion that killed the prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has risen to 40."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-24T00:43:33Z","webTitle":"NSW treasurer Matt Kean says federal Nationals ‘can resign from the ministry’ if they don’t back net zero ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","fields":{"headline":"NSW treasurer Matt Kean says federal Nationals ‘can resign from the ministry’ if they don’t back net zero ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, says the Nationals will need to decide if they want to resign and “support a Labor government” if they don’t back a federal commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The comments come ahead of a critical Nationals party room meeting in Canberra on Sunday afternoon, which will consider the party’s position after it sent a list of demands to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday. Morrison is hoping to clinch the support of the Nationals before he heads to Glasgow next week for the United Nations climate summit, but has made clear amid the high-stakes negotiations that the final decision will be up to cabinet. Nationals’ cabinet ministers – including the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie – would need to resign if they refused to back the cabinet position, a move that would lead to turmoil within the government and potentially trigger an election. Kean, who successfully secured the support of the NSW Nationals for a target of halving emissions by 2030, said he believed the coalition at a federal level should also pursue an “ambitious” interim goal that reflected the average of state emission reduction targets of about 35%. “I want to see the prime minister lead the world when it comes to taking action on climate change because it is in our economic interests to do so,” Kean told ABC’s Insiders program. “We know that there is an economic arms race under way for the next generation of jobs, investments, export opportunities and economic prosperity, and I want to see Australia at the head of the pack to grab those opportunities and set us up for a more prosperous future.” When asked if Morrison should forge ahead with cuts without the support of the junior Coalition partner, Kean said the prime minister should “continue to act in the nation’s interest.” “And if the Nats won’t get on board, they have a very clear choice: they can resign from the ministry and support a Liberal Government, or they can resign from the ministry and support a Labor government,” he said. “Now, I know what the best path forward for our country is and that’s a strong National-Liberal Coalition government putting the interests of our nation first. That’s what we’ve done in New South Wales and I know that that is what will happen in Canberra.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said the party room had only looked at the revised technology roadmap “just over a week ago”, but would resolve its position on Sunday. “Our party room has worked pragmatically, respectfully as we possible could and we will hopefully get to a resolution one way or another today,” he told Sky News. In response to suggestions the party was demanding a change to legislation to explore the potential of nuclear power, Littleproud said the idea was not electorally popular. “Nuclear is something the Nationals party obviously stands firmly behind as a party room but we understand you have got to educate before you legislate.” “The electorate isn’t necessarily there with us at the moment. We have to be pragmatic about that. You have still got to win elections.” Kean said MPs advocating nuclear were “pursuing a fantasy”. “People talking about nuclear to solve our current needs are chasing a unicorn. It may have a role to play in the future as technology evolving, so I won’t rule it out, but right now I’m focusing on things that will work,” Kean said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T06:06:34Z","webTitle":"PM grills Peter Dutton on location of power plants amid Coalition’s nuclear push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","fields":{"headline":"PM grills Peter Dutton on location of power plants amid Coalition’s nuclear push","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has doubled down on Liberal support for nuclear power, pre-empting a review of its energy policy by arguing nuclear will be needed to support renewables. Dutton told the Minerals Council on Wednesday that Australia needs a “frank debate” about nuclear energy, suggesting that it has a “wonderful opportunity to add value” to its uranium resources. The comments sparked a demand from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time for the Liberals to nominate “where the plants are going to be”. On Wednesday Dutton confirmed that he appointed Ted O’Brien as shadow energy minister in part because a committee inquiry he chaired in 2019 recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The Coalition is still reviewing its energy policy to develop an emissions reduction target before the next election and study nuclear energy to develop a “proper base of information”, according to comments Dutton made in the party room in August. On Wednesday the Liberal leader said “the imperative on all of us to create affordable and reliable and, where possible, emissions-reduced energy necessitates that we at least have a conversation about nuclear”. “[About] how that technology can play into the energy mix in the future? I think especially since Australia is home to one third of the world’s deposits of uranium. We have a wonderful opportunity to add value to that resource.” Dutton noted that former Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke “was strongly in favour of nuclear energy and couldn’t get it through the left of his party”. “John Howard to this day is very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as an option ... that crazy rightwinger in Canada, Justin Trudeau, is embracing small modular reactors.” Dutton posed the question: “If you don’t like coal and you don’t like gas, unless you believe clean hydrogen is about to be a reality, then what else firms up renewables? And I don’t know the answer to that question beyond nuclear.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton suggested nuclear energy could also help Australia “power up irrigation and open up thousands of square kilometres of export opportunities” before concluding the government should “at least allow” the community to have a debate about it. In August the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said “it is by far the most expensive form of energy”. “I mean, this is economic illiteracy from an opposition searching for relevance,” he told ABC News Breakfast. “[Nuclear] is slow to deploy. It couldn’t be deployed in Australia until 2030. “The CSIRO has made it very, very clear renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Nuclear is the most expensive. Why with rising energy prices you would put in the most expensive form of energy available is beyond me.” Later on Wednesday, the Liberals pursued Albanese in question time over his pre-election claims that Labor’s energy policy, including more renewables and upgrading the grid, could help save households $275 on their power bill. Albanese replied that the government stands by the modelling supporting the claim, and that Labor’s policy was based on the systems plan of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which identified it would “promote investment in renewables which is the cheapest form of energy”. Albanese said after “22 failed plans” the Coalition now wants “to go towards nuclear energy”. “And they can say, if you like, where the plants are going to be. I’ll look forward to their review, letting us know … [because] we know they have to be near urban areas and water.” While Labor raised the spectre of campaigning on the location of putative nuclear power plants, Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous voice to parliament “sight unseen”. “We have no idea what it means for the mining sector,” Dutton told the Minerals Council earlier. “We don’t know whether a voice that doesn’t represent the elders that you negotiate with or that your agreement is with in a particular location, now, they might be usurped and [the voice will] exercise a veto, right? That would damage your employees, that would damage your business.” Earlier, Dutton said it was an “inconvenient truth” for climate activists that “decarbonisation will require more mining”, due to critical minerals’ importance in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles. “I take some delight knowing it must keep them up at night.” Dutton said the Liberals don’t support “locking in” the 43% emissions reduction target in legislation because the “inflexible position” might disadvantage Australia if competitors did not meet their targets and it would make it “harder if not impossible” for government agencies to fund resources projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T00:29:37Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says he’s ‘not afraid’ of nuclear debate after advocate named shadow energy minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says he’s ‘not afraid’ of nuclear debate after advocate named shadow energy minister","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has confirmed that his frontbench pick for the opposition’s climate and energy portfolio signals he is up for a debate about nuclear power in Australia. In Sunday’s reshuffle the Liberal MP and nuclear power advocate Ted O’Brien was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the crucial portfolio. On Monday Dutton told ABC Radio National he was “not afraid to have a discussion on nuclear”, confirming he had considered O’Brien’s support for the form of power in deciding to take the fight to Labor on electricity prices and emissions reduction. In December 2019 O’Brien chaired a parliamentary committee that recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The report won plaudits from some other Liberals in the party room and Nationals in the Senate, although O’Brien has reportedly said the ban should not be lifted without bipartisan support. Dutton said O’Brien was a “very considered person”, praising his work on the latest generation of nuclear power – “the small modular nuclear generation which can power up to 100,000 houses”. “If we want to have a legitimate emissions reduction, if we want to lower emissions reduction, that’s exactly the path President Macron has embarked on in France, it’s what prime minister Johnson is talking about in the United Kingdom,” he told Radio National. “I don’t think we should be afraid to talk about any technology that’s going to have the ability to reduce emissions and electricity prices. That’s something we can consider in time. I don’t think we should rule things out simply because it’s unfashionable to talk about them.” Labor has long called on the Coalition to rule out the “fantasy” of nuclear power, and threatened to campaign against it in communities where plants had been proposed, such as Townsville. A nuclear reactor is expected to take at least 15 years to build. Although small “modular” reactors show promise, the CSIRO science agency has suggested they won’t be affordable until 2050. The Australian Nuclear Association has said nuclear power would only be cost competitive with gas and coal generation if Australia adopted a price for carbon emissions, an anathema to the Coalition since its repeal of Labor’s interim carbon price. The conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs released a poll, taken in April, finding that most Australians (53%) agreed with the proposition that “Australia should build nuclear power plants to supply electricity and reduce carbon emissions”. About a quarter (23%) disagreed, and 24% neither agreed nor disagreed. On Monday the Liberal senator Hollie Hughes, the shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy, said she was “not personally in favour” of extending carbon emission reduction targets. Hughes told ABC News Breakfast that Australia “could shut everything down tomorrow and all go live in trees” and the impact on total global emissions would be negligible. She suggested Australia should consider small modular nuclear energy. The Coalition reshuffle also saw Julian Leeser, an advocate of an Indigenous voice to parliament, appointed to the role of shadow attorney general and Indigenous affairs minister. Dutton said the Coalition was “very open to the discussion and what the government has to say” on the voice. “In principle, do we support anything that’s going to improve the situation of Indigenous Australians? Absolutely.” But he warned there “are things that can be done now in those communities that don’t need to wait for a referendum, and I would like to see those actions”. “Every government that I’ve been in, that I’ve witnessed … Liberal or Labor, has had good intention … of closing the gap. “There have been some successes and we should celebrate those successes, but that we’re still talking about sexual assault of women and children, now, and the domestic violence incidences at a record rate is completely and utterly deplorable.” Dutton also signalled greater efforts to recruit women to the Liberal party but ruled out the use of quotas. The shadow cabinet now contains 10 women, three in the Nationals and seven in the Liberals, with Sarah Henderson joining as shadow communications minister but Marise Payne stepping back into the cabinet secretary role. Dutton said the Liberals were “at a disadvantage” because women in the labour movement could run for office, then work for unions or industry super funds if they lost. “Business won’t do that for the Liberal party. A small businesswoman who is juggling an overdraft and trying to get her business up and running can’t afford to take six weeks off for a campaign, because her business goes broke. “So we need to come up with a different model, and that in my mind is the biggest inhibitor.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T18:00:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: object found near Nord Stream 2 ‘no safety risk’; Bakhmut battle has ‘badly damaged’ Wagner forces – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: object found near Nord Stream 2 ‘no safety risk’; Bakhmut battle has ‘badly damaged’ Wagner forces – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light on Wednesday for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said on Wednesday. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region” and that there were “no casualties or damage”. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties and that unemployment “remains at an all-time low”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy also extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for following. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” Read the full story here: The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine, in a further shift away from its traditional pacifist stance. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light today for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine, approving a request by the German defence ministry and foreign office. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. About €12bn in total will be released related to the Ukraine conflict over the next decade or so. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the German government has made available more than €14.2bn in support for Ukraine, according to the foreign office. In a statement, three lawmakers representing the coalition government on the committee said: With the money, Ukraine can directly buy armaments with the support of the German government. The move represents a “very important step with which we make it clear that we are supporting Ukraine in the long term in its fight against Putin,” said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius. The agreement will allow supplies including armoured vehicles, tanks, and ammunition to be delivered to Ukraine in the coming years, according to a statement from the minister. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has responded to remarks by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov who earlier today said Russia’s “hybrid war” against “hostile states” will continue “for a long time”. Peskov and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are both “wrong: the war can be ended diplomatically”, Podolyak posted to Twitter. He called on Russian forces to immediately withdraw from occupied parts of Ukraine, adding that “a reboot must happen in Moscow for that”. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region”. He added: It crashed in a field. There were no casualties or damage. It has not been possible to independently verify his claim. A letter from a Russian girl who drew anti-war pictures at school, addressed to her father who has reportedly fled house arrest after being sentenced to two years after being convicted of discrediting the armed force, has been made public. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was detained by police and placed under house arrest at the start of this month. His daughter Masha was moved to a state-run shelter. On Tuesday, a court spokesperson said Moskalyov had fled house arrest overnight and his whereabouts are currently not known. A human rights lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, has since said Moskalyov had been in touch with him and sent him a copy of a letter that Masha had written him from the children’s home. The letter reads: Hi Dad, I really ask you not to get sick and not to worry. Everything is fine with me, I love you very much and know that you’re not guilty of anything. I am always on your side, and everything you do is right. It ends with “I love you” in English, and the words “you are a hero” inside a heart. The family said they had faced pressure from police since last April when Masha, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials at the time summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. He was eventually charged with discrediting the armed forces for his social media posts in which he called the Russian regime “terrorists” and described the Russian army as “rapists”. The high-profile case was criticised by Russian human rights groups and led to an online campaign to reunite father and daughter. Russian authorities have put a member of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot on a wanted list for criminal suspects, according to an interior ministry database. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova is on Russia’s federal wanted list, Russian news outlet Mediazona has reported. The entry said Tolokonnikova faces criminal charges, but it did not specify what the charges are. Tolokonnikova left Russia and reportedly lives in the US. She was designated a “foreign agent” by the Russian government in 2021. My colleague Zoe Williams interviewed Tolokonnikova in March last year. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country, but insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, said: The sanctions imposed against the Russian economy in the medium term could really have a negative impact. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared the clip: During the meeting, Putin said unemployment in Russia “remains at an all-time low” and that inflation is expected to “drop below 4%” by the end of March after soaring in spring last year. However the “return to a growth trajectory should not make us feel relaxed”, he said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Tthe UN’s nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, has said the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country.

Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Morawiecki said he had agreed with the leaders of several countries bordering Ukraine to write to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to demand action. Morawiecki, at a news conference, said: We demand the use of all regulatory instruments - quotas, tariffs, which will limit or block the import of Ukrainian grain into Poland. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through Poland and Romania, after its Black Sea ports were blocked following Russia’s invasion. But logistical bottlenecks have meant large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU, have ended up in central Europen countries, Reuters reports. The influx of Ukrainian grain has damaged prices and sales of local farmers, and caused a major headache for Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party in an election year. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi visiting Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been held by Russian forces for more than a year. Ukraine’s sports ministry condemned on Wednesday what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. “The ministry of youth and sports of Ukraine condemns the partial change of the position of the International Olympic Committee regarding the non-admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian ministry said in a statement. “We have consistently advocated and will continue to insist that under the conditions of the unprecedented unprovoked military aggression of the Russian Federation with the support of the republic of Belarus against Ukraine, which contradicts the principles of the Olympic charter, representatives of aggressor states should not be present at international sports arenas.” Reuters is carrying a quick snap that the Danish energy agency says that the object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Rafael Grossi, the UN’s nuclear agency chief, has told the media in Russia that the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Tass reports that he was shown “objects damaged as a result of shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine”. Russian forces have occupied the plant since March 2022, forcing Ukrainian staff to continue working while under occupation. Russia has claimed that Ukraine has shelled both the station and the nearby residential area of Enerhodar. Ukraine has claimed that shelling has been by Russian forces. Grossi previously visited the site in September 2022. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, Reuters is reporting the Spanish defence minister, Margarita Robles, as saying. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s, Robles told lawmakers, adding that Spain had repaired them and would test their combat readiness before shipping them to support Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Russia’s invasion. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. In an audio message, Prigozhin said: The battle for Bakhmut today has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army and, unfortunately, it has also badly damaged the Wagner private military company. Asked about Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s promise to defend Bakhmut to the end, CNN reported Prigozhin as saying his forces would win in “the greatest turn in this war and in all modern history”. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has condemned the International Olympic Committee’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as neutrals, describing the decision as “shameful”. Speaking at a news conference, Morawiecki said Poland would build “a coalition of states to together demand that the IOC withdraw this bad and wrong decision”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Ryabkov, in remarks carried by Interfax news agency, said: There will be no notifications at all. All notifications, all kinds of notifications, all activities under the treaty will be suspended and will not be conducted regardless of what position the US may take. The 2010 New Start treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia, limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy. The US and Russia hold nearly 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads between them. Vladimir Putin announced last month that Russia was suspending participation in the treaty, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Ryabkov’s remarks reflect a change of course, after the Russian foreign ministry initially said it would continue notifying the US about planned test launches of its ballistic missiles. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. A spokesperson for the US national security council said yesterday: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. It comes as Russia conducted drills of its strategic missile forces today, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s nuclear capability. A Siberian journalist whose news website published content that was critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has gone on trial charged with discrediting Moscow’s armed forces, according to a report. Mikhail Afanasyev, one of the best-known journalists in Siberia and chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces in April 2022. His arrest came after the website’s reporting on 11 riot police officers who allegedly refused deployment to Ukraine. He was accused of disseminating “deliberately false information” about the Russian armed forces, an offence that carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years under a law passed last year. My colleague Andrew Roth reported on Afanasyev’s arrest last April: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. She said: I strongly recommend that Russian citizens do not adopt Ukrainian orphans who were illegally taken out of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children are currently considered illegally deported to Russia or Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s ministry of integration of occupied territories. Russia says it has been evacuating people voluntarily from Ukraine, and claims it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. Russia’s defence ministry said in mid-August that 3.5m people had been brought to Russia by then, including more than half a million children. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, 464 children have died so far since the war began in February last year. Police have estimated that 356 are still missing. Writing on her Telegram account today, Vereshchuk added: Once again I remind all Russian so-called ‘adoptive parents’ and ‘guardians’: sooner or later you will have to answer. The international criminal court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this month against President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting Ukrainian children. More than 220,000 Russian personnel have been killed or injured since its troops invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, citing the latest US assessment. From Sky News’ Deborah Haynes: Russia’s “confrontation with hostile states” is “going to last for a long time”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Here’s more from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where the Ukrainian president extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. Zelenskiy, who has not spoken to Xi since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, said: We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Asked if Xi would accept Zelenskiy’s invitation, or whether one had been officially extended, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She added that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine”. In response to Zelenskiy’s interview, the Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has arrived the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed. The IAEA chief is visiting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since near the beginning of the invasion, to review the situation there, the spokesperson said. They said: At the plant now. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, with Russian media outlets reporting he has arrived. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA has reported that the UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has now arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since very near the beginning of the invasion. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that there are power outages in some areas of Kyiv and also Odesa which have been caused by weather conditions, rather than enemy action. It writes: In Kyiv and the region, due to worsening weather conditions, emergency shutdowns of lights were used. Most of them are at the Vyshhorod, Kyiv-Sviatoshyn, and Vasylkiv power stations, DTEK reported. There are also stabilizing power outages in some areas of the capital and the region. In Odesa, seven settlements remain without power due to bad weather. Russia’s embassy in the US has issued a punchy statement overnight in response to what it says are “statements of a number of US administration officials on support for the creation of a special tribunal against Russia”. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Such comments are an outright profanity that has nothing to do with justice. The US continues to demonstrate a complete disregard for the norms of international law in favour of its own geopolitical interests. The outrageous and unfounded accusations of alleged aggression, crimes against humanity and other violations are nothing more than an element of the Russophobic campaign organised by Washington as part of the hybrid war unleashed against us. The US hypocritically and cynically refrains from assessing the criminal acts of the nazis who have settled in Kyiv and have been terrorising civilians for many years. Washington is silent about its own role in the incitement of the Ukrainian conflict. It continues to support [the] Zelenskiy regime through the endless supply of lethal weapons, as a result of which the civilian population continues to die, including children, and kindergartens, schools and hospitals are destroyed. How may Washington speculate on “responsibility for aggression”, when the international community has not yet recovered from the catastrophic consequences of American adventurist interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, bombing of Yugoslavia and the atrocities in Vietnam? Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”, Reuters reports, citing news agency TT. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”. State-owned news agency Tass quotes him saying: Despite the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states, all the declared goals of the special military operation will certainly be achieved. We will achieve the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, ensure the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the security of our population. Late last year the Russian Federation claimed to annex four regions of Ukraine after organising widely derided “referendums” in the regions which they partially occupied. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, in a move not widely recognised by the international community. An IAEA spokesperson has confirmed that UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi was on his way to the plant. He said Grossi was in the Zaporizhzhia region, but declined to say where. According to Reuters, he shared a photograph of Grossi standing in body armour by an armoured UN car on the side of a road. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday, Reuters reports. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. More from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where Ukraine’s president was unstinting in his criticism of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy said Putin was an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia. President Xi Jinping has recently attended a state visit in Moscow, and extended an invitation to Putin to visit Beijing. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Despite Putin’s nuclear provocations, and some of the harsh rhetoric that has come from his allies such as Dmitry Medvedev, Zelenskiy told AP he does not believe the Russian leader is prepared to use the bomb. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this news round-up of the latest developments on its official Telegram channel: In the morning, a series of explosions rang out in the temporarily occupied Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia. The lights went out in some areas of the city and settlements. During the day, the Russian army launched 34 airstrikes and artillery strikes on the de-occupied part of Kherson region, three on Kherson. It struck houses, a hospital and a post office. One person is injured. At night, the Ukrainian military destroyed a Russian Su-24M bomber in the direction of Bakhmut, the air force reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Journalists from Associated Press accompanied Volodymyr Zelenskiy on part of his trip this week around frontline regions of Ukraine, and to the border region of Sumy. During that time, Ukraine’s president reiterated requests for more modern weaponry, and also said some elements that had been supplied by the west had not worked. “We have great decisions about Patriots, but we don’t have them for real,” he said, referring to the US-made air defence system that has been promised. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. Zelenskiy added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy also reiterated his longstanding request for fighter jets, saying: “We still don’t have anything when it comes to modern warplanes.” Poland and Slovakia have decided to give Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, but no western country so far has agreed to provide modern warplanes, through concerns that it might escalate the conflict and provide Ukraine with strike capabilities deep into Russian territory, and that the length of time that it would take to train pilots and provision ground crews makes the delivery in the short-term impractical. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. “The cessation of its export activities on the Russian market will not affect the volume of domestic grain shipments abroad. The company’s grain export assets will continue to operate regardless of who manages them,” the agriculture ministry said in a comment to Reuters. A spokesperson for Cargill’s Russian unit declined to comment to the news agency. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured due to the war. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. “Thus Hungary’s gas supply will continue without any disruptions,” the statement added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Microsoft said in a threat assessment earlier this month that Russian actors had launched attacks in at least 17 European countries in the first six weeks of this year. Thales and Microsoft said Russia’s invasion was accompanied by widespread cyberattacks in Ukraine, but they were repelled. Both firms said Russia shifted focus to other European countries late last year. “In the third quarter of 2022, Europe was dragged into a high-intensity hybrid cyberwar at a turning point in the conflict,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Thales vice president for cyber solutions. Jolivet said countries outside Ukraine were suffering a “massive wave” of DDoS attacks, when a server is flooded with requests that crash the network. These attacks were increasingly carried out by “hacktivist” groups aligned with the Kremlin rather than official groups, and they aimed to sow chaos rather than destroy infrastructure, Thales said. Poland, Latvia and Sweden were among the most affected countries, the Thales report said. Microsoft said in its assessment that attacks this year in Europe were largely aimed at government entities for espionage purposes. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Russia’s state TASS news agency, citing Moscow-installed officials in the area, said Ukrainian shelling had damaged the city’s power supply system and knocked out electricity in the city and some nearby villages. TASS also reported that a locomotive depot was destroyed but according to initial information, there were no casualties. The Guardian has not verified these reports independently. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is visiting the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine today. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. He said in an interview with Reuters that his work on forging an agreement to protect Europe’s largest nuclear power station was still alive. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters yesterday: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength, Reuters reports. President Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. “In total, more than 3,000 military personnel and about 300 pieces of equipment are involved in the exercises,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram. The drills involve the Strategic Missile Forces comprehensive control checking of the Omsk missile formation together with a command and staff exercise with the Novosibirsk missile formation equipped with the Yars systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in an interview that he he worries the war could be affected by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. Following its long interview with Ukraine’s leader, AP reports: Zelenskiy is well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and western Europe. But some in the United States – including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate – have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid. Trump’s likely Republican rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a ‘territorial dispute’ with Russia was not a significant US national security priority. He later walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP. Zelenskiy didn’t mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians – figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says that he he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. And Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. The United States has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin first promised 14 but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks have also arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine, officials have said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov has been separated from his daughter Maria since he was placed under house arrest, and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old had fled house arrest and his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision was “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T17:20:45Z","webTitle":"Australia and France agree arms deal for Ukraine as talks seek to bury Aukus debacle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","fields":{"headline":"Australia and France agree arms deal for Ukraine as talks seek to bury Aukus debacle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia and France have agreed a deal to jointly manufacture and supply thousands of artillery shells to the Ukrainian army, the defence and foreign ministers of the two countries announced on Monday. The agreement, “worth several million (Australian) dollars”, was announced after bilateral talks in Paris aimed at resetting the relationship between the two countries seriously damaged by the 2021 Aukus affair. A first shipment of 155mm shells from existing stocks is expected to be delivered to Kyiv within the next two months. The ministers refused to give further details of the contract that will see Australia and France jointly manufacture the ammunition that can be used by French, American and German artillery supplied to Ukraine. Australian deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said the signed agreement was the opening of “new cooperation between the Australian and French defence industries.”. “We wanted to act together as a statement of how importantly Australia and France regard support of Ukraine in the current conflict. We wanted to make it really clear that Australia and France stand together in support of Ukraine in the face of the aggression from Russia,” Marles added. Marles and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, met their counterparts Sébastien Lecornu and Catherine Colonna for what is known as a “2+2” meeting, the first since the 2021 diplomatic rupture sparked by Aukus. France was furious after Canberra dumped a $90bn deal for French submarines in favour of a deal with the US and UK. Angry French officials, including the French president Emmanuel Macron, accused the government of Scott Morrison of “betrayal”. At a press conference after the talks in Paris on Monday, the key – and repeated – words were “warmth” and “friendship” between the two countries. In an opening salvo, Colonna said the talks were the first of their format since 2021 adding drily: “I will not go back over that.” She said the aim of the meeting was to forge a partnership based on “mutual respect, confidence and common values”. Asked if the two countries trying to publicly paper over the cracks in their relationship publicly, she replied: “It’s not communication. It’s politics”. Marles said the aim of the talks was to “grow and deepen the relationship between our two defence forces and said the two countries had agreed to greater access to their respective defence facilities in the Indo-Pacific region. Asked whether delays in the Aukus programme meant Australia would be asking France to supply “interim” submarines, Marles said no. “We are obviously working closely with the US and the UK to develop a nulcear power submarine capability. We will be in a position to make our annoucement about that soon…there are no plans for any conventional powered interim submarine capability as we work towards gaining nuclear power capability.” Lecornu said he hoped the countries could start with a “blank page”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T17:17:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Crimea navy oil depot fire ‘contained’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Crimea navy oil depot fire ‘contained’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good evening that concludes our blog coverage for today, you can read all our stories on Ukraine here A huge fire in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday has been put out after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. The fire was later extinguished, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. The Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Around 190,000 Russian soldiers have died since the conflict began, according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence. A court in Russia has convicted a woman over social media posts condemning the war in Ukraine and punished her with a steep fine despite her asking for a prison sentence. Marina Novikova, a 65-year-old lawyer, was found guilty of “spreading false information” about the Russian army, which was made a criminal offence after Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine. Novikova’s posts on the messaging app Telegram decried the invasion and criticised the Russian government, Sky News reported. Prosecutors had requested a three-year prison sentence and Novikova pleaded with the court to send her to prison rather than be issued with a fine of at least 700,000 roubles (£6,900). But the court in Seversk instead imposed a fine of one million roubles (nearly £10,000), the Russian human rights and legal aid group OVD-Info quoted her husband, Alexandr Gavrik, as saying. The fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the city’s Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. Experts examined the site and “it became clear that only one drone was able to reach the oil reservoir”, Mikhail Razvozhaev said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that no one had been injured in the fire which was caused by a drone strike. Another drone was downed, its wreckage found on the shore near the terminal, Razvozhaev added, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian military intelligence official said more than 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia’s Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported. The official, Andriy Yusov, did not claim Ukraine was responsible for the explosion in comments reported by RBC, instead describing the blast as “God’s punishment” for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. “This punishment will be long-lasting. In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor’s army,” RBC quoted Yusov as saying. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces said earlier he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for the fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire that was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday has been put out after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area.

Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse The American political commentator Noam Chomsky has said Russia is fighting with more restraint in Ukraine than the US and its allies did during the invasion of Iraq. In an interview with the New Statesman released on Saturday, the celebrated linguist said the destruction seen in Iraq’s capital has not been witnessed in the current conflict. He said: Undoubtedly Russia could do it, presumably with conventional weapons. It could make Kyiv as unliveable as Baghdad was, could move in to attacking supply lines in western Ukraine. Chomsky also said Britain and the US had refused peace negotiations in Ukraine, and that Washington was only supplying weapons to Kyiv in order to weaken Russia. For the US, this is a bargain. For a fraction of the colossal military budget, the US is able to severely degrade the military forces of its only real military adversary. Chomsky was challenged on his views on Ukraine in a combative interview with Times Radio host Matt Chorley earlier this week. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement posted to its Telegram channel, the embassy said it noted Martin’s comments about Cafferkey’s “clear principles”. It said: We do not know what his principles were. What we do know, though, is that in a very big way it is the Irish government and media to who bear responsibility for the death of Finbar Cafferkey. It has been the government and media who have been promoting anti-Russian propaganda, distorting the truth about the conflict in Ukraine, misleading people like Finbar Cafferkey. Commenting on Twitter, the former justice minister Charlie Flanagan said: Threatening, intimidating &amp; chilling statement by Russian embassy Dublin. These hostile remarks are unacceptable. Beyond time Ambassador Filatov &amp; his crew were asked to leave our country. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans, Agence France-Presse reports. Since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. On Friday, the Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army, a court representative told the news agency. Chernysheva, who runs a baking business, has been posting pictures of colourful cakes bearing slogans in opposition to armed conflict on Instagram, where she is followed by more than 25,000 people. She was briefly detained on Thursday after an ultra-conservative media outlet drew attention to her work in January. Other cakes, decorated with hearts and flowers, referenced pop culture or read “Love will win” or “I love you!”. Pope Francis met Ukrainians who had fled the war on Hungary’s eastern border on Saturday, telling the refugees that a different future is possible. Reuters reports: Francis met with about 600 refugees, poor and homeless people in a visit to St. Elizabeth’s church in Budapest on the second day of his visit, which began on Friday when he pointedly warned of the dangers of rising nationalism in Europe. Francis was serenaded by a singing band of Hungarian Roma wearing flower-patterned clothing and seemed to enjoy the music as they hovered around him as he sat in his wheelchair. But what Francis heard earlier was much more sober. Oleg Yakovlev told of he and his wife Lyudmila and their five children had to leave Dnipro a year ago after Russian bombings. “We were welcomed here and we have found a new home (but) many have suffered and suffer still because of the war,” Yakovlev told the pope. Sitting in the first row of the church with his family, the youngest of Yakovlev children, a boy of about four, was amused by the attention he was getting, making faces at reporters as his father spoke of missiles, crumbled buildings and a 1,500km trip to safety. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, 2022, millions of refugees have fled through Central Europe, including Hungary, and moved to other countries. About 35,000 have applied for temporary protection status in Hungary. Francis said expressing compassion for those suffering from poverty and tragedy is an integral part of being a Christian, even if those in need are non-believers. “Even amid pain and suffering, once we have received the balm of love, we find the courage needed to keep moving forward: we find the strength to believe that all is not lost, and that a different future is possible,” he said. Later the pontiff met with Metropolitan (bishop) Hilarion, representative of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Budapest. Hilarion was effectively ousted from the number two post at the ROC headquarters in Moscow last year, a decision seen as indicating discord at the top of the Russian Patriarchate over the war. The Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of the churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, which split with Western Christianity in the Great Schism of 1054. The Russian invasion of Ukraine divided world Orthodoxy and strained relations between the Vatican and the ROC. ROC Patriarch, Kirill, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kirill fully backs the war as a bulwark against a West he describes as decadent. The European Union tried to put Kirill on its sanctions list last year but member states failed to find unanimity on the issue as Hungary opposed his inclusion. Relations between the Vatican and the ROC have been frosty since Francis said last year that Kirill should not be “Putin’s altar boy”. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. AFP reports that the city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. It lies upstream on the Dnipro River from Kherson, the regional capital from which Russia withdrew last November. Novaya Kakhovka fell to Russian forces on the first day of their invasion. When a Northumberland couple opened up their village home to a Ukrainian mother and her two daughters last year, they were responding to the plight of refugees escaping the Russian invasion. Having been told no more than that this was a musical family, Sheilagh Matheson and Chris Roberts offered two bedrooms and a honky-tonk piano. Soon they found themselves arranging the loan of a Steinway upright after discovering that these children had an extraordinary musical talent – one that made passersby stop to listen at an open window. Both girls have now received scholarships to two of the UK’s foremost music schools, less than a year after fleeing their home near Kyiv to start new lives in Corbridge, not far from Newcastle. The BBC’s Ukraine correspondent, Myroslava Petsa, reports comments from Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence (GUR) that 10 tanks of petrol were destroyed in the blaze at the Sevastopol fuel depot on Saturday. A spokesperson said the fire was “God’s punishment” against Russia for the missile strikes against Ukraine on Friday that killed at least 25 people. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Reuters reports that Andreyev told the TASS news agency: Today the Polish authorities decided to take forceful action, despite the fact that this is a diplomatic building, a school building. This is an illegal action and a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. We of course will lodge a protest. The Polish state-run news channel TVP Info reported that police were present outside the school on Kieleckiej street in Warsaw on Saturday morning. The two countries’ already fraught relations have soured further over the war in Ukraine with Warsaw helping to arm Kyiv. A fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the Moscow-installed governor has said. Reuters reports that Mikhail Razvozhaev said on Telegram: Open fire was extinguished in an area of 1,000 square metres. He said earlier that no one had been injured and according to preliminary information that the depot was hit by two drones. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram that air defence and electronic warfare forces had shot down two drones over the Crimea on Saturday. He confirmed there were no casualties Russian and blamed the attacks on Ukraine. A spokesperson for Ukraine‘s armed forces said he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for Saturday’s fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. More than a dozen fuel tanks are situated at the site in Kozacha Bay. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas.

With Reuters and Agence France-Presse Drone footage shows the aftermath of the airstrike in Ukraine on early Friday morning that left 23 people dead and dozens more injured. The upper floor of a residential building in the central city of Uman, south of Kyiv, was struck as people slept. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned the latest “evil” Russian assault in his evening address on Friday. Ukraine‘s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it had passed notes to Polish and EU representatives describing the limits their countries had placed on Ukrainian grain imports as “categorically unacceptable”. Reuters reports that the ministry said: Such restrictions, whatever the justification for them, do not comply with the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU and the principles and norms of the EU single market. There are full legal grounds for the immediate resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural goods to Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as the continuation of unhindered exports to other EU member states. It comes a day after the European Commission said on it had reached a deal in principle to allow the transit of Ukrainian grain to resume through Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. In his evening address, AFP reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy as saying: We need to involve everyone ... to put pressure on the Russian aggressor and the terrorists who kidnapped so many of our children. The UN, many others want to do something, but so far the results have been poor. So I have appealed to the leader of China. Xi and Zelensky spoke by phone on Wednesday, the first known call between the two leaders since the start of Russia’s invasion. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the invasion. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. It says many of them have been placed in institutions and foster homes, an allegation denied by Russia, which insists it saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. Russia’s private Wagner militia, which is leading the assault on Bakhmut in Ukraine and has been active in Africa, could soon cease to exist, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said in video remarks to a blogger that were released on Friday evening. It was not immediately clear when Prigozhin had spoken and how serious he was being. He said earlier in the week he had been joking when he said his forces would stop shelling Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces to show the city to journalists. Reuters reports that he told Russian war blogger Semyon Pegov: Now, with regard to the need in general for shells at the front, what we want. Today we are coming to the point where Wagner is ending. Wagner, in a short period of time, will cease to exist. We will become history, nothing to worry about, things like this happen. Pegov posted the clip on his Telegram channel. Wagner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have popped up like mushrooms after rain,” says Maria Glazunova, who works at the Dovzhenko Centre, Kyiv’s film archive. “They are lovely places where you can drink coffee, read, and just sniff the books.” After the terrifying early months of 2022, and a brutal winter of drone attacks and blackouts, a crop of new independent bookshops is hardly what one would expect to find in the Ukrainian capital. But, in defiance of Russia’s ongoing invasion, they are springing up all around Kyiv.

The update added: There is a realistic possibility that Russia was attempting to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies recently provided to Ukraine. Russia operates an inefficient targeting process and prioritises perceived military necessity over preventing collateral damage, including civilian deaths. Video footage of the oil terminal on fire in Russian-occupied Crimea. Footage apparently taken from the scene shows large flames at the scene and thick smoke billowing into the sky, amid claims of a drone attack. Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said on his Telegram channel that 18 fire brigades were tackling the blaze on Saturday morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. We should prove that such attempts will never reach success, to block further attempts being made in the future. Yoon made the comments in a speech at Harvard University’s Kennedy School on the fifth day of a state visit to mark the 70th anniversary of the US-South Korean alliance. Yoon was asked about the possibility of South Korea providing lethal aid to Ukraine and replied: We are closely monitoring the situation that’s going on the battlefield in Ukraine and will take proper measures in order to uphold the international norms and international law. Right now we are closely monitoring the situation and we are considering various options. Joe Biden is considering visiting new Nato member Finland to coincide with the military alliance’s July summit in Lithuania, NBC News has reported, citing three US officials familiar with the discussions. The US network said the White House’s discussions of a potential visit by the US president had been ongoing for several months and remained active, according to the officials, who said no final decision had been made. Any Finland visit would be for a summit of multiple Nordic countries, not for a bilateral visit, an administration official said. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Reuters reports that firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble, searching for survivors and bodies as anxious people stood by. “My neighbours are gone. No one is left,” said Serhii Lubivskyi, 58, who survived inside a flat on the seventh floor. He was rescued by firefighters from the balcony where he escaped with his wife after the explosion blocked their front door. Officials said at least 23 civilians were killed, including four children, with an estimated 109 people living in the part of the block that was hit and 27 flats completely destroyed. Lubivskyi wept as he looked up at the smouldering gaps in the building where adjacent flats had been blasted away. An elderly woman, her daughter and two grandchildren lived on the ninth floor. They are gone. A man with his son lived on the eighth floor. They are gone. A woman with her daughter lived on the seventh floor. They are gone. A young family lived on the sixth floor, their son was lucky ... he is alive. In the south-eastern city of Dnipro, a missile killed a two-year-old child and a 31-year-old woman, said the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak. Video released by the authorities showed a blackened hole where a missile had crashed through an apartment window. Moscow claimed it had targeted locations of Ukrainian reserve troops and had struck them successfully, preventing them from reaching the front. It supplied no evidence to support this. A fuel tank was ablaze in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the governor said on Saturday. Reuters reports that the Moscow-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhaev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit.” Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has come under repeated air attacks since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Russian officials have blamed the attacks on Ukraine. The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Kyiv almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Razvozhaev said no one was hurt in Saturday’s fire. The situation is under the control of our firefighters and all operative services. Since the volume of fuel is large, it will take time to localise the fire. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton with the latest developments to bring you up to speed. A fuel tank was on fire in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit,” Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Meanwhile, five children are among the dead as the toll from Russia’s wave of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine rose to 25. Rescue workers were searching for survivors and bodies amid the smouldering rubble of a nine-storey block of flats hit in Uman, central Ukraine. The barrage of more than 20 missiles early on Friday is Russia’s first large-scale air strike in almost two months. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described Uman as “absolutely peaceful” and condemned the attacks, saying: “Only absolute evil can unleash such terror against Ukraine.” He added: “Our air force managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles – 21 out of 23. If not for this, the terrorist state would have managed to claim many more casualties, more lives.” More on those stories shortly.

A major announcement 18 months in the making is expected when the UK prime minister meets his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, and US president Joe Biden. In response to concerns about Beijing’s economic coercion and foreign policy aims, the UK’s defence and security strategy for the 2020s is being updated, and the revised version is due to be published on Monday. It will address “increasingly concerning behaviour” by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s government, the “grave risks” posed by Russia after a renewed assault on Ukraine and “hybrid threats” to Britain’s economy and energy security, No 10 said. Before his trip to California, Sunak hailed “global alliances” – such as the one formed between the UK, US and Australia in September 2021 – as “our greatest source of strength and security”. He added: “I am travelling to the US today to launch the next stage of the Aukus nuclear submarine programme, a project which is binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.” The UK would be “secure, prosperous and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners”, thanks to the programme and the updated Integrated Review, Sunak said. He will hold meetings on Sunday night and Monday, before flying back home before the budget on Wednesday. The visit threatened to cast a shadow over Sunak’s trip on Friday to Paris, given the French government reacted with consternation to its own submarine deal with Australia being scrapped a year and a half ago. Britain is stepping up efforts to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific, and Sunak hopes the trilateral summit on Monday will demonstrate his commitment to standing up to China, which senior Conservative MPs have urged him to take a tougher stance on. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that Sunak had expressed delight to fellow ministers about the outcome of negotiations, with multiple sources saying they believed the eight nuclear-powered submarines would be based on British designs. Such a move would safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, since the full fleet may not be seaworthy until the 2040s. Reports this week suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US. Under the three-way deal the US and UK will agree to share secret reactor technology. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor – putting its diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut”, according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. Charles Edel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, has described the Aukus pact as a calculated gamble. “It’s a bet that by further integrating industrial capacities and increasing interoperability it will significantly augment the capabilities of our allies, make them more powerful, and ultimately change Beijing’s calculations about its security environment,” he said. “And that by doing so, it will help stabilise a region that has been badly destabilised by China’s rapid expansion of military capabilities and increasingly aggressive foreign policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T16:32:59Z","webTitle":"Ukraine pilots being trained to fly F-16 jets, says Nato","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine pilots being trained to fly F-16 jets, says Nato","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said that the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. “The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them,” the former prime minister of Norway said as he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels. The development follows months of internal debate in Washington over the risks of Ukraine deploying F-16s to attack targets on Russian territory and potentially escalating the conflict. The US has control over the jets’ re-export from any country that has them in its arsenal. As recently as February the US president, Joe Biden, declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine’s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Kyiv has in recent days warned that its long-anticipated counteroffensive is running into Russia’s air and artillery superiority. Despite those challenges, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said on Thursday that progress in its counteroffensive was being made, with Ukraine regaining control over 4o sq miles (103 sq km) since the weekend. Ukrainian forces were said to have pushed 2 to 4 miles into formerly occupied lands. Hromov told journalists that his troops had benefited from the provision of MiG-29 planes from Poland and Slovakia and claimed, without providing evidence, that Russian soldiers were deliberately inflicting wounds upon themselves to avoid battle. Hromov said: “The Ukrainian army has gained considerable experience and skill on the battlefield this year, and we are ready and will continue to fight until the complete liberation of our own territories, even with our bare hands. With heavy weapons from our allies, this will happen faster.” Ukraine’s army is said to have advanced by 2 miles near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia region and by up to 4 miles near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: “There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. The enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces.” Stoltenberg said western hardware was making a difference in the fighting. Moscow has widely disseminated video footage of US Bradley armoured vehicles and German-made Leopard tanks being hit by Russian fire. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine retained sufficient firepower for the battle to come. “I think the Russians have shown us that same five vehicles about 1,000 times from 10 different angles,” he said. “But quite frankly, the Ukrainians still have a lot of combat capability, combat power. “This will continue to be a tough fight, as we anticipate it, and I believe that the element that does the best in terms of sustainment will probably have the advantage at the end of the day.” The US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said it was too early “to put any estimates” on how long the Ukrainian counteroffensive would last. He said: “This is a very difficult fight; it is a very violent fight and it will likely take a considerable amount of time and at high cost.” Russian military bloggers have claimed as many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike by a US-made Himars rocket system earlier this week, although Ukrainian officials declined to comment. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark were sending “high priority” air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery would be completed within weeks. Last month, it emerged the UK had already delivered multiple Storm Shadow cruise missiles, giving Ukraine’s defence a new long-range strike capability. That move had prompted threats from the Kremlin and earlier this week Belarus’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, engaged in further nuclear sabre-rattling as he announced that Russian tactical warheads would be relocated to Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg said the situation was being monitored but that it did not appear to be a significant move. “We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing,” he said. “So far, we haven’t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture”. He added: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia to assess the risks to Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The dam’s reservoir provides the cooling water for the plant. After his inspection, Grossi said measures had been taken to stabilise the situation but he added that inspectors would stay at the facility, in a sign of the concerns the visit had raised among officials at the UN’s atomic watchdog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-06T18:46:29Z","webTitle":"Syria and Turkey earthquake: what we know so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","fields":{"headline":"Syria and Turkey earthquake: what we know so far","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At least 2,600 people have been killed after two powerful earthquakes struck Turkey and Syria within the space of 12 hours. The death toll is expected to rise, with search and rescue operations under way across the region as many buildings have collapsed and there are thought to be many people trapped in the rubble. Official figures from Turkey said 1,651 people were killed in 10 provinces, with another 11,119 injured, according to the country’s health minister. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria rose to 968 people, with 1,280 injured, according to data from the Damascus government and rescue workers in the north-western region controlled by insurgents. More than 10 search-and-rescue teams from the European Union had been mobilised since the earthquake, a spokesperson for the European Commission said. The US, UK, Canada, Israel, Russia and China were among other nations to have offered assistance, and calls have emerged for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country’s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake. The first quake struck as people slept, and measured magnitude 7.8, one of the most powerful quakes in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude, and was 42 miles (67km) north-east of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, at a depth of 2,000 metres. There have been more than 100 smaller aftershocks registered by seismologists. The partial destruction of a Roman-era castle in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near where the first quake had its epicentre, led to fears that the earthquakes may have damaged other priceless monuments in Turkey and Syria, areas rich in cultural heritage. Turkey’s armed forces set up an air corridor to enable search-and-rescue teams to reach the zone affected. Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is under construction, was not damaged by the earthquake, an official from the Russian company building the plant said. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for increased funding for humanitarian aid in Syria, saying that many people in the north-west of the country have already been displaced up to 20 times, and that medical care in the region was “strained beyond capacity, even before this tragedy”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned about areas in Turkey from which there had been no news since the earthquake. In 1999, a tremor of similar magnitude to today’s quakes in Turkey devastated İzmit, killing more than 17,000. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has described Monday as the worst disaster for the country since 1939, when an earthquake killed more than 32,000 people and injured more than 100,000. There were no reports of British deaths in the earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria, said the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, acknowledging the relief effort was still at an early stage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T14:45:53Z","webTitle":"China owns vast network of UK real estate, offshore records reveal ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","fields":{"headline":"China owns vast network of UK real estate, offshore records reveal ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Chinese government owns a vast network of UK real estate via offshore secrecy jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and the Isle of Man, the Guardian can reveal, raising questions about Beijing’s grip on links in the UK supply chain. Disclosures made as part of a new government register of property owned via offshore entities show that China’s investment division owns more than 250 properties across Britain via dozens of companies. They include distribution centres that are key to the flow of food and goods in multiple regions of the UK including the south-west and south-east of England and the Midlands. The properties are all ultimately owned via the China Investment Corporation (CIC), which manages the foreign exchange reserves of the People’s Republic of China and is estimated to have more than £970bn of assets. Land Registry records suggest that CIC has spent at least £580m on UK properties, although the true figure is likely to be significantly higher because some records are incomplete. While CIC was known to be an investor in UK property, the scale and detail of its purchases has remained hidden until now due to the use of a vast array of offshore companies. The register, which brought the details to light, indicates that CIC has focused on distribution depots, retail parks and trading estates, including some that are critical to regional infrastructure. Chinese investment in the UK has been a source of concern and division within the government. Some MPs welcome the flow of cash into Britain, while others have raised security concerns about the role played by China and Chinese companies in strategic assets. In 2020, the government ordered that the telecoms company Huawei be removed from Britain’s 5G mobile phone infrastructure before 2027, a decision that Beijing described as “groundless”. The government also went cold on plans for China General Nuclear to be involved in the building of a new nuclear power plant, buying CGN out of its stake in the planned Sizewell C project. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said it was concerning that so much of the investment was “disguised” via offshore companies. He drew comparisons with the attempted takeover of the UK tech company Newport Wafer Fab, which initially appeared to be the target of a Dutch company before its ultimate Chinese ownership was revealed. The government eventually blocked the deal on security grounds. “You sometimes have to go back several links to discover who actually owns the company,” said Duncan Smith, who chairs the international Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. “If they can buy that much, all sounding like important parts of the supply chain, it begs the question of why they’re doing this. This makes the case that we now need to have a strategic audit of the total amount of Chinese finance inside UK key areas, including universities, technology and supply chains. We’re way too open to the interests of Chinese companies.” CIC and the Chinese embassy did not return requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T06:18:11Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Tony Armstrong calls out racist abuse; lions escape Sydney enclosure; Netanyahu ahead in Israel poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","fields":{"headline":"Afternoon Update: Tony Armstrong calls out racist abuse; lions escape Sydney enclosure; Netanyahu ahead in Israel poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good afternoon. Racism is in the headlines today, with the ABC notifying police over a racist email sent to Indigenous sports presenter Tony Armstrong. The presenter publicly shared the offensive email on Twitter last night. Separately, the AFL racism review is back in the spotlight after a partner of a former Hawthorn player said she would not take part in the culturally “unsafe” investigation. Alastair Clarkson, who was Hawthorn coach at the time and denies wrongdoing, started work today in his new role as North Melbourne coach. Vigils for Cassius Turvey, the Indigenous teenager killed in Perth, will also be held tonight across the nation. Top news Tony Armstrong | The matter is now with the police after Armstrong called out a racist email. AFL racism review | A Gunditjmara and Bunitj woman known as Amy, who is the partner of a former Hawthorn player, said in a statement: “The question the AFL should be asking itself is not ‘Did these things happen?’ but ‘How did these things happen on our watch?’” The woman claims Hawthorn demanded she terminate her pregnancy. Zoo lions scare | Five lions at Sydney’s Taronga zoo escaped out of their enclosure this morning, forcing staff and visitors to hide in “safe zones”. One cub was tranquillised, but otherwise the lions “calmly made their way back” to their enclosure. Missing men | Two men are missing in New South Wales flood waters as the Riverina town of Gundagai braces for its worst flooding in 33 years. The pair were riding in the back of a ute that was swept off the road while being driven across a spilling causeway about 50km from Boorowa on Monday night. There are 95 active warnings across the state, and Victoria has 74 flood warnings in place. Denmark elections | The incumbent prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, will likely get another term after the left-leaning bloc maintained a slim majority. Frederiksen’s Social Democrats won 27.5% of votes, the party’s best election in more than two decades. Netanyahu ahead in Israel elections | Exit polls indicated the former Israeli PM – currently facing a corruption trial – may be able to form government, but his opponent, prime minister Yair Lapid, said nothing is final “until the last envelope is counted”. The polls showed Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, which includes the far-right Religious Zionists, would capture 61 or 62 seats, giving him the majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Bolsonaro breaks silence | Brazil’s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro refused to congratulate or recognise the victory of his leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, two days after the results. Instead, he thanked the 58 million voters who had backed his failed campaign, adding that “peaceful protests will always be welcome”.

Here’s where we stand: Ukrainian forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts, without providing details. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed, however, that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, it said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and men. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were en route to inspect the facility. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar’s city council is located, according to its mayor Dmytro Orlov. The alleged Russian attack on Energodar occurred hours after a team led by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, set off from Kyiv to visit the Russian-held power plant. The team arrived in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 55km (34 miles) away from the plant, on Wednesday afternoon. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said his agency will seek to establish a permanent presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to avoid “a nuclear accident” at the facility. He added that the agency’s visit to the plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally” and will not run out of ammunition any time soon, according to Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units, the latest update by the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, in a move that has heightened already acute nervousness over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, Gazprom, the Russian state energy company said, citing the need to carry out repairs. EU foreign ministers have agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia. The move will mean that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians which eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. The move to restrict travel visas for Russians is a step “in the right direction”, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the EU fails to do so. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, the four countries – which all border Russia – said in a joint statement published before the EU’s visa deal suspension announcement. The funeral of the Soviet Union’s last leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91, will take place in Moscow on Saturday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter and his foundation. The ceremony will be held on 3 September in the Moscow Hall of Columns, the same place where Joseph Stalin’s body was put on display following his death in 1953, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter Irina. Vladimir Putin has sent official condolences to the family of Mikhail Gorbachev as the Kremlin broke its silence over the death of the last leader of the Soviet Union. But it has demurred on whether Gorbachev will receive a state funeral or be dealt a final snub by a successor who tore down his legacy. Germany’s economy ministry has asked the country’s domestic intelligence agency to investigate two senior ministry officials over allegations of spying for Russia. German intelligence services opened an inquiry after senior economy ministry staff shared their concerns when the two civil servants showed “sympathy for the Russian view” on questions of energy policy, according to Die Zeit. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. The Biden administration is expected to announce additional security aid for Ukraine shortly, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said at a news briefing: We ... committed more than $13 billion of security assistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and we will continue to do that. And there will be announcements of future security assistance in the coming days. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his agency will seek to establish a permanent presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to avoid “a nuclear accident” at the facility. The 14-strong team from the UN nuclear watchdog is expected to arrive at the Russian-held nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Grossi said: My mission is... to prevent a nuclear accident and preserve the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The “real work” begins tomorrow, he said, adding that he was going to “try to establish a permanent presence for the agency” at the nuclear plant. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency has arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia, from where they plan to travel to Russian-controlled territory to inspect Europe’s biggest power plant. Recent bombardment in the area has led to fears of a catastrophe, with Ukraine and Russia trading blame for the attacks. “My mission is a technical mission. It is a mission that seeks to prevent nuclear accident,” says Rafael Grossi, the IAEA chief. He added that the plant was a Ukrainian facility despite being currently occupied by Russian forces. The funeral of the Soviet Union’s last leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91, will take place in Moscow on Saturday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter and his foundation. The ceremony will be held on 3 September in the Moscow Hall of Columns, the same place where Joseph Stalin’s body was put on display following his death in 1953, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter Irina. The same day, Gorbachev will be buried at Moscow’s central Novodevichy cemetery, Russian state-owned news agency Tass cited Vladimir Polyakov, press secretary for the Gorbachev Foundation, as saying. A source close to the Gorbachev family had earlier told Tass that he would be buried next to his wife Raisa, who died in 1999. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier that the Kremlin would decide on Wednesday whether Gorbachev would be given a state funeral, and whether President Vladimir Putin would be in attendance. The EU’s move to restrict travel visas for Russians is a step “in the right direction”, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said. Finland and other members of the European bloc that share a land border with Russia, including the Baltic states and Poland, have been calling for an EU-wide tourist visa ban for Russians. Speaking to reporters following the EU’s announcement, Haavisto said: This goes in the right direction but once again we saw that so far there has been a lot of talk and little action. He added: When Russia is invading Ukraine and we receive refugees from Ukraine and try to help Ukraine in every way, this is not a time for holidaymaking and luxury tourism (for Russians). Germany’s economy ministry has asked the country’s domestic intelligence agency to investigate two senior ministry officials over allegations of spying for Russia, Die Zeit has reported. German intelligence services opened an inquiry after senior economy ministry staff shared their concerns, according to the weekly. The two civil servants drew the attention of colleagues by showing “sympathy for the Russian view” on questions of energy policy, including on the decision to block the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, it said. The pair are said to have an “emotional proximity to Russia”, according to the report, though as yet authorities had no “hard evidence” of spying or corruption. It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so and should not be underestimated, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr, told Reuters in an interview: The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate the Russian land forces’ potential to open a second theatre of war. Russia also has a navy and air force at its disposal as well as substantial reserves, he added. He said: Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally”, he said. The dynamic of Russia’s attack had slowed down but Moscow’s forces were “supported by massive artillery fire” and still pressing steadily ahead, “regardless of civilian Ukrainian casualties”, Gen Zorn said. He also suggested Russia was not about to run out of ammunition any time soon, adding: The Russians have enormous quantities of ammunition at their disposal. This ammunition is partly old and very inaccurate but it is exactly this that causes great destruction to civilian infrastructure. They fire around 40,000 to 60,000 rounds of artillery ammunition per day. EU foreign ministers agreed on Wednesday to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia, making it harder and more costly for Russian citizens to enter the bloc, reports Reuters. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell told a news conference in Prague: We agreed on … full suspension of the European Union-Russia visa facilitation agreement. This will significantly reduce the number of new visas issued by the EU member states. It’s going to be more difficult, it’s going to take longer. The suspending of the visa facilitation agreement means that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians that eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. However, an agreement on an outright ban could not be reached after Germany and France warned their peers that such a move would be counter-productive. Some eastern states have said they will press ahead with a visa ban themselves if there is no EU agreement. More than 1 million Russian citizens have entered the bloc through land border crossing points since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, most of them via Finland and Estonia, the bloc’s border agency Frontex said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said today that the agency’s first planned visit to Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day, Reuters reports. Grossi told reporters at a hotel in Zaporizhzhia: The mission will take a few days. If we are able to establish a permanent presence, or a continued presence, then it’s going to be prolonged. But this first segment is going to take a few days. We have a very important task there to perform – to assess the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as we can. He added that the IAEA team had guarantees from both Russia and Ukraine enabling it to enter the war zone. Politicians from around the world paid have tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, who has died aged 91. “Gorbachev is one of those people who changed the world, and unquestionably changed it for the better,” said the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Similar sentiment was expressed from leaders across the globe. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, highlighted Gorbachev’s role in overcoming division in Europe, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called him a “courageous reformer”. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were en route to inspect the facility. Evhen Yevtushenko, head of Nikopol district military administration, said the Russian army was shelling Energodar, adding: These provocations are dangerous. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar’s city council is located, according to its mayor Dmytro Orlov. He posted pictures of a damaged high-rise with a hole punched into the side and debris littering the ground. The attack occurred hours after a team led by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, set off from Kyiv to visit the Russian-held power plant. The team have arrived in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 55km (34 miles) away from the plant. Grossi said the mission’s visit to the nuclear plant was a “technical mission” that aimed to prevent a nuclear accident. Sweden will donate artillery ammunition worth around 500m krona (£40m) to Ukraine, the Swedish government has said. The announcement comes after Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Sweden to provide Ukraine with Archer artillery systems, RBS-70 air-defence systems, and more artillery shells. The “best thing Sweden can do in the field of defence” in the coming weeks is to provide Ukraine with more weapons, Kuleba said in a joint press conference on Monday with Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and foreign minister, Ann Linde. He added: As strange as it may sound, the best way to save human lives, including the lives of civilians, and to save more Ukrainian villages and towns from destruction, is to give Ukraine more weapons so that we can repel Russian aggression and the Russian army. Kuleba also thanked Sweden for allocating a new aid package to Ukraine, which will be divided into reconstruction and defence aid. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the European Union as a whole fails to do so. In a joint statement obtained by AFP, the four countries, which all border Russia, said the suspension of a 2007 visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia was “a necessary first step”. The move, proposed by the presidency and backed by many EU members, would make EU visas more costly for Russian travellers and lift a deadline on visa issuance times. The statement added: But we need (to) drastically limit the number of visas issued, above all tourist visas, to decrease the flow of Russian citizens into the European Union and the Schengen area. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, they said. Until such measures are in place on the EU level, we … will consider introducing on the national level temporary measures of visa ban, or restricting border crossing for Russian citizens holding EU visas. Speaking to reporters in Prague, Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, called for a “ban of entry of Russian Federation citizens into the European Union”. He added: Timing is crucial and the loss of time is paid by the blood of Ukrainians. Meanwhile, Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto announced on Facebook that the EU will suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement. There will not be a blanket visa ban imposed as there is no unanimity on that, he added. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia ahead of a visit to a Russian-held nuclear power plant. A convoy brought in the 14-strong team, led by the head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi, which had left Kyiv in the morning. The city is normally about a two-hour drive from the plant but it is unclear how or when the team will reach the site given the complexities of crossing into Russian-held areas. Before heading off with his team to Zaporizhzhia this morning, Grossi told reporters they planned to spend “a few days” at the plant and would report back afterwards. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency has left Kyiv for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in a region of Ukraine occupied by Russia, for an inspection after bombardment in the area led to fears of a catastrophe. The IAEA mission, comprising representatives from countries deemed neutral by both sides, will inspect the plant and lend technical assistance. The visit was reportedly intended to last four days. But the Russian-occupying authorities said on Wednesday that the IAEA will be given access for one day. They also said that the mission will be expected to join the queue of civilians who cross back and forth to the occupied territories. If this happens, it could delay or disrupt the visit. These potential obstacles come in addition to safety concerns. Ukraine and Russia have given their security guarantees for the mission to travel to the plant and the neighbouring areas, Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said before leaving Kyiv. The plant and the surrounding towns continue to come under shelling. Last week, fighting in and around Europe’s largest nuclear plant damaged vital electricity supplies prompting global concern. Grossi described the mission as “very complex”. “We are going to a war zone,” he said. Read the full article here. Grain silos in Ukraine’s second biggest port, Mykolaiv, caught fire after they were struck by Russian shelling of the city, Ukraine’s emergency service has said. In a statement on Facebook, Ukraine’s emergency service said: As a result of the shelling of Mykolaiv, grain silos at an infrastructure facility in the Korabelny district caught fire. Firefighting continues. It published photos showing holes in the metal roofs of at least two silos and fire brigades pouring water on damaged facilities. Russian military units are reportedly locking conscripts in hot rooms without water until they agree to sign up to fight in Ukraine, Russian media has reported. Russian outlet Ridus has reported that a local military recruitment centre in the Tver region has received complaints that conscripts are being coerced through psychological pressure into signing military contracts. The outlet cited the mother of a conscript in the Tver region as saying: Guys in this military unit, on the orders of the political officer, are gathered in the club in enormous heat and with the windows closed. They don’t let them leave and they don’t let them drink water. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. Such pressure tactics, if true, highlight some of the difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion as a “special military operation”. Under Russian military rules, only contract soldiers can be sent to the frontline. Ukrainian forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts. Sobolevskyi did not provide any details about the alleged success of the Ukrainian troops, but his comments came as Russia’s defence ministry claimed that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, the Russian defence ministry said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and men. It also said its forces had shot down three Ukrainian helicopters and that Ukraine had lost four fighter jets during two days of fighting around the Mykolaiv-Kriviy Rih frontline and in other areas of southern Ukraine. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again today with all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: A team of nuclear experts are en route by car to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) envoy set off from Kyiv this morning to the plant in south-eastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness reported from the scene. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told a briefing in Kyiv as reported by Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform: “We are finally leaving after six months of effort. The IAEA is heading to the Zaporizhzhya NPP. As you know, we have a very important task there – to work and examine the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as possible.” However, the UN nuclear inspectors who set off on Wednesday morning from Kyiv might not visit the facility until Thursday. A Reuters reporter travelling in a convoy with the team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was likely the inspectors would stay overnight in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia before visiting the plant, which is on territory controlled by Russia, on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the south of the country. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to retake Kherson will be a “slow operation to grind the enemy”, the senior presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour,” he wrote. “But we don’t fight like that … Funds are limited.” Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Europe, citing a need for maintenance on its only remaining compressor and raising the prospects of recession and energy rationing throughout the region. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany between 1am GMT on Wednesday and 1am GMT on Saturday 3 September, according to Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Data from the Nord Stream 1 operator’s website, as cited by Reuters, showed flows at zero for 4-5am Central European Time (2-3am GMT) on Wednesday. European governments fear Moscow could extend the outage in retaliation for western sanctions imposed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been struck by artillery fire and is located only a few dozen kilometres from the frontline, the agency said in a statement. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. The full report released by the UK Ministry of Defence added that Russia “continues to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine.” Boris Johnson has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing him as a man “who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better”. Johnson added the Kremlin is “intent on undoing the good” of Gorbachev and attempting to “recreate that Soviet empire” with its war in Ukraine, PA Media reports. The former leader of the Soviet Union died on Tuesday night at the age of 91. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. The previous head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. Ukraine is using wooden decoys of advanced US rocket systems to trick Russia into wasting its missiles on them, according to the Washington Post. The decoy versions of US-supplied rocket launcher systems drew at least 10 Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, leading Ukraine to further boost its production of replicas, in an effort to lure Moscow into firing its expensive long-range missiles on fake targets, the publication said. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has died in Moscow aged 91. Gorbachev’s reforms led to the unlooked-for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. He died after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. Recent reports suggested he was had a kidney ailment. Ukraine’s parliament endorsed several laws and ratifications on Tuesday to bring the country closer to the European Union, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “We are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief who will lead an expert team to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine this week. “It’s an important mission, and we’re doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity,” he said during a meeting with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, on Tuesday. The head of the Russian-installed local administration, Yevgeny Balitsky, said he did not expect much from the IAEA visit and told the Interfax news agency the inspectors “must see the work of the station in one day”. At least five people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Zelenskiy said. “Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of five people today, another 12 were wounded.” The wholesale price of gas has dropped sharply in a rare respite from recent highs on signs that Europe is preparing to intervene directly in energy markets. The European Commission said it was working “flat out” on an emergency package, and on a longer-term “structural reform of the electricity market” to combat soaring prices while efforts to fill gas storage facilities appear to be ahead of schedule. The day-ahead UK wholesale gas price tumbled by more than 20% to 447p per therm on Tuesday, while the month-ahead contract dropped by a quarter, to 473p per therm. Vladimir Putin said in a condolence telegram sent today that Mikhail Gorbachev had a “huge impact on the course of world history”. Putin said the former Soviet leader, who died aged 91, “led our country through a period of difficult, dramatic change and substantial foreign policy, economic, and social challenges”. The Russian president said that Gorbachev “deeply understood that reforms were necessary” and strove to offer his own solutions to the problems faced by the Soviet Union in the 1980s, reports Reuters. UN nuclear inspectors who set off for Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this morning from Kyiv might not visit the facility until Thursday. A Reuters reporter travelling in a convoy with the team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was likely the inspectors would stay overnight in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia before visiting the plant, which is on territory controlled by Russia, on Thursday. There is confusion about how long the inspection will last after Russian-installed officials in the area suggested the visit might last only one day. While the IAEA and Ukrainian officials suggested it could last several days. There are widespread reports of an oil depot fire taking place in a village near the town of Dzhankoy, in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Authorities have not yet commented on the videos of the blaze that are being shared on social media. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said today that Russian forces are becoming “more active in the occupied territories”. In a post on Twitter, he alleged they are robbing businesses, farmers and dismantling factories. The latest pictures from the newswires show the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) setting off today from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv towards the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Conservative leadership hopeful Rishi Sunak said the legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev will be “remembered by us all” and that he helped “bring peace to Europe”. Boris Johnson has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing him as a man “who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better”. Johnson added the Kremlin is “intent on undoing the good” of Gorbachev and attempting to “recreate that Soviet empire” with its war in Ukraine, PA Media reports. The former leader of the Soviet Union died on Tuesday night at the age of 91. Speaking outside a police station in Lewisham, south-east London, the prime minister said: Mikhail Gorbachev is one of those people who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better. When you look at what he did to make Europe whole, free, to give freedom to the countries of the former Soviet Union – it was quite an extraordinary thing. And of course, Mikhail Gorbachev is one of those people who triggered a change, a series of changes, that perhaps he didn’t anticipate. Maybe he paid his own political price for it but when history is written, he will be, I think, one of the authors of fantastic change for the better in the world. And what I worry about today is that the current leadership in Moscow is intent on undoing the good of Mikhail Gorbachev, and is intent on a revanchist attempt, a revenge-driven attempt, to recreate that Soviet empire, and you’re seeing that in Ukraine - that’s the tragedy, something that Mikhail Gorbachev would have thought was absolutely unthinkable, unwarranted. Ukraine‘s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the European Union to ban Russian tourists, describing the measure as appropriate since a majority of Russians supported the country’s “genocidal war of aggression” against Kyiv. Kuleba told Reuters as EU foreign ministers were set to meet in Prague on Wednesday for talks: The time for half-measures is gone. Only a tough and consistent policy can produce results. The ministers are expected to agree on suspending a visa facilitation agreement with Moscow, meaning that Russians will have to wait longer, and pay more, for visas, while the bloc is likely to stay split over an outright EU travel ban. In a statement emailed to Reuters, Kuleba said: A visa ban for Russian tourists and some other categories will be an appropriate response to Russia’s genocidal war of aggression in the heart of Europe supported by an overwhelming majority of Russian citizens. He also proposed launching a special programme for Russian soldiers who do not want to fight in Ukraine. (The message): save yourself and leave. Lay down arms, surrender to Ukrainian forces, and get an opportunity to start a new life. I am confident that this offer is worth making, because even if one Russian soldier lays down arms and decides to leave, it means saved Ukrainian lives and closer peace. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. The full report released by the UK Ministry of Defence this morning reads: Ukrainian armoured forces have continued to assault Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces on several axes across the south of the country since Monday. Ukrainian formations have pushed the front line back some distance in places, exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defences. In line with its doctrine, Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units. These will likely include some of those from the Eastern Grouping of Forces. Russia continues to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine. Volunteer battalions of the new 3rd Army Corps had departed their home base near Moscow by 24 August, highly likely for onward deployment to Ukraine. The operational effectiveness of these units is not known. The 3rd Army Corps is highly likely short of personnel and these troops have had limited training.” The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been struck by artillery fire and is located only a few dozen kilometres from the frontline, the agency said in a statement. The statement followed a meeting of the agency’s director, Audrey Azoulay, and Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, in Paris. The agency added: On 24 July 2022, part of the large glass roof and windows of Odesa’s Museum of Fine Arts, inaugurated in 1899, were destroyed. It said it had mobilised experts to support Ukraine so that the nomination can be examined urgently by World Heritage Committee member states. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Europe, citing a need for maintenance on its only remaining compressor and raising the prospects of recession and energy rationing throughout the region. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany between 1am GMT on Wednesday and 1am GMT on Saturday 3 September, according to Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Data from the Nord Stream 1 operator’s website, as cited by Reuters, showed flows at zero for 4-5am Central European Time (2-3am GMT) on Wednesday. European governments fear Moscow could extend the outage in retaliation for western sanctions imposed. Further restrictions to European gas supplies would heighten an energy crunch that has already sent wholesale gas prices soaring over 400% since last August. The upcoming work was announced less than two weeks in advance and is being carried out by Gazprom not Nord Stream AG, focusing on the last operating turbine at the station. Moscow blames maintenance issues and sanctions it says prevent the return and installation of equipment. Gazprom said the latest shutdown is needed to perform maintenance on the pipeline’s only remaining compressor. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the south of the country. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. Another senior presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Russia aimed to force the UN team through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. “Russia is trying to disrupt the visit of the IAEA mission to the nuclear power plant by simulating combat operations in Energodar and shelling the area near the nuclear power plant,” he said. Zelenskiy also claimed Russia “does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station”. The occupiers have not abandoned the plant, they are continuing bombardments and are not withdrawing arms and ammunition from the site. They are intimidating our personnel. The risk of a nuclear catastrophe due to Russian actions is not diminishing for even an hour”, he added. “An immediate and total demilitarisation in Zaporizhzhia is necessary”. Zelenskiy met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief who will lead an expert team to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine this week. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, arrived in the Ukrainian capital late on Monday at the head of a 14-strong team before a visit to the Russian-occupied plant. Zelenskiy said the mission was “probably one of the top-priority questions regarding the safety of Ukraine and the world today”, and called for the “immediate de-militarisation of the plant” and its transfer to “full Ukrainian control”. The Ukrainian president said he hoped the delegation would “find an opportunity, thanks to our special services, thanks to the security corridors, to get to the station and do the best to avoid all those threats on a global scale”. He also urged the mission to do more than inspect the plant, saying that strategic decisions were required “regarding the urgent demilitarisation of the station, the withdrawal of all, any, military personnel of the Russian Federation with explosives, with any kind of weapon”. A team of nuclear experts are en route by car to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) envoy set off from Kyiv this morning to the plant in southeastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness reported from the scene. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told a briefing in Kyiv as reported by Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform: We are finally leaving after six months of effort. The IAEA is heading to the Zaporizhzhya NPP. As you know, we have a very important task there - to work and examine the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as possible.” Grossi said he hoped to establish a permanent mission in Ukraine to monitor Europe’s largest nuclear plant before the mission’s departure. These operations are very complex operations. We are going to a war zone. We are going to occupied territory. And this requires explicit guarantees from not only from the Russians, but also from the Republic of Ukraine. We have been able to secure that ... So now we are moving.” “I am really very conscious of the relevance of this moment but we are ready. The IAEA is ready. We will be reporting back after the mission. We are going to be spending a few days there,” he added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. A team of nuclear experts are en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from Kyiv this morning amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. Meanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the plant in the south of the country. It is 7.30am in Kyiv.

The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Ukrainian officials said Moscow’s forces are approaching Odesa and analysts believe Russia could soon target the city to completely block Ukraine’s Black Sea access. Ukraine’s parliament endorsed several laws and ratifications on Tuesday to bring the country closer to the European Union, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “We are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU,” he added.

It fears he will exploit the result to take this Nato founder member further from the liberal secular west, but hopes against hope that, not being eligible to run again and thus freed from the need to pander to a nationalist electorate for the rest of his political life, he may at least be open to persuasion and base his foreign policy on something other than self-preservation. Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. The immediate issue is to prevent him falling into the lap of Vladimir Putin. Few western diplomats are optimistic. One said: “In the past he had turned transactionalism almost into an art form and then almost an ideology. But recently it has grown into a real antipathy towards western values and arrogance.” Erdoğan’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, during the campaign said that anyone who displayed pro-western tendencies was a traitor. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. He has already lifted his block on Finland’s membership but has left Sweden in limbo and in a potentially dangerous grey zone. Sweden, which has a larger Kurdish population than Finland, says it is struggling to rationalise some of Erdoğan’s demands, including for the extradition of 140 Kurds, whose names have never been definitively passed to the Swedish government. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey. But the rightwing Swedish government cannot order its judges to extradite Kurds. Officials pretend Sweden’s Nato membership is a self-standing issue but in practice most see it as linked to the blocked US arms sales to Turkey, not to mention the future status of the battery of S-400 missiles bought by Ankara from Russia. Joe Biden, despite calling Erdoğan an autocrat, is willing to lift the block, endorse the $20bn sale of F16 jets and open a new chapter with Turkey. But the US president first has to persuade the leaders of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees to endorse the sale. Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, recently hinted at flexibility, saying he was willing to endorse the sale so long as the Swedish Nato issue was resolved. McCaul said: “We’ve been assured that after the election, regardless of the winner, that Sweden will be recognised as a Nato ally.” Democrats in Congress still want wider assurances about Turkey stopping its threats to Greece, so talks of a moratorium on military exercises in the Aegean is promising. But even a sale of arms would not in itself end Erdoğan’s resistance to western efforts to detach him from Putin. In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine. Turkish deals with penalised Russian companies, trade with Russia in western-made products and the export to Russia of so-called dual-use goods such as plastics, rubber and electronics have all been raised by the US with little effect. Turkey is simply not willing to impose sanctions on Russia, and Washington is not willing to impose secondary sanctions on Turkey, fearing it would drive Erdoğan into Putin’s arms. More broadly the west favours Erdoğan’s plans to lower tensions with his neighbours including Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt and Armenia. In some specific respects even Erdoğan’s re-election is a boon to the west. With his human rights record, his request for EU membership, suspended since 2018, can continue to gather dust in the pending tray, something that would have been less easy if Erdoğan’s opponent Kemal Kiliçdaroglu had been elected. Second, Kiliçdaroglu’s increasingly strident vow to force millions of Syrian refugees back over the border into Syria sounded like vote grubbing without a plan. Erdoğan by contrast sounds more plausible when he says he has a plan to rehouse 1 million Syrians in northern Turkey back over the border. His connections with Putin, and hence the Syrian president, Bashir al-Assad, make that plan the more plausible of the two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T08:51:31Z","webTitle":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","fields":{"headline":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dressed in overalls with “leave it in the ground” scrawled on their backs, climate protesters shovelled coal over the side of a goods train bound for the Drax power station in 2008. It is now 14 years on from the train “hijack” and government officials are considering their own raid on the North Yorkshire power station – this time on the company’s finances. The power giant, Britain’s single-biggest source of carbon emissions – thanks to the biomass and coal it burns – has benefited handsomely from the link between electricity prices and soaring gas prices, along with a group of nuclear plants and older solar and windfarm projects. This windfall – evident in a quadrupling of profits – has thrust Drax and its fellow generators, which are propped up by historic subsidies, into the eye of a gathering storm. With households and small businesses crushed by soaring bills, the government is considering options to break the link between gas and electricity prices as well as a windfall tax on electricity generators. The plan could be one of Kwasi Kwarteng’s first acts as chancellor if, as expected, he is promoted from business secretary by the UK’s new prime minister, Liz Truss. Germany’s decision to impose a windfall tax on electricity generators may embolden ministers to follow suit. Earlier this year, as the government imposed the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on North Sea oil and gas operators, a similar measure was mooted for electricity generators – but was dismissed as too complex. A further leaked Treasury analysis claimed gas producers and electricity generators could make £170bn in excess profits over two years. For most companies, precise figures on windfall profits are hard to come by. But for Drax it is clear that the good times roll. In July, the company said profit before tax had risen to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, bolstered by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, while landing a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. The group’s chief executive, Will Gardiner, saw his total pay package swell more than 30% to £2.7m. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 56% to 660p, valuing the company at £2.65bn, after peaking at 831p in April. But the threat of a windfall tax has twice punctured the share rally and it may now face pressure to rip up the contracts for its units which burn wood pellets. Thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, Drax will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies. The shape of any potential raid on electricity generators’ profits could prove crucial for Drax and its peers. A simple extension to corporation tax – as applied to the oil giants – could prove most damaging to profits and, critics argue, investor sentiment in green energy. Instead, the business department is reportedly scrutinising a plan which would see older Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) voluntarily ripped up in favour of Contracts for Difference (CFDs). ROCs are an anachronism from the early days of green power generation. They were first introduced in 2002, paying renewable energy producers the wholesale market rate plus a subsidy. The scheme was closed to new entrants in 2017 and replaced with less generous CfDs, which offer electricity plants a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity. If the market price is higher than the strike price, a government entity called the Low Carbon Contracts Company ensures these savings are passed on to consumers. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. LCCC data shows that with UK power prices more than tripling in the past year, windfarms have paid back more than £360m. Under the proposals, those with ROCs would be encouraged to switch to CfDs. The benefit to consumers could be lower bills, and for the company a guaranteed long-term income which could reassure investors. However, the voluntary scheme could be undermined if companies decide instead to take their chances that gas prices will remain high for years. For those on ROCs with only a few years remaining, it could prove attractive, less so for those with a decade to go. Denmark’s Ørsted held the most ROCs in 2020/21, ahead of Drax, SSE and Germany’s RWE. Although the energy market as a whole is dominated by a clutch of large players, nearly 60% of the UK onshore wind ROCs market consists of smaller developers, Bernstein analysts estimate. The ROCs register is public: it shows everything from the Achanalt power station, a small 20 megawatt hydroelectric site in the Scottish Highlands owned by SSE, to the Four Burrows windfarm, owned by renewable specialist RES, near Truro, Cornwall. However, the nature of each site’s contracts remain undisclosed. Many will be tied into long-term electricity supply deals typically agreed between power producers and electricity traders or suppliers. ROCs are also tradable. For larger companies, their power is predominately hedged ahead in the futures markets (sold in advance) – meaning some are yet to see the full benefit from this year’s surge in gas prices. RBC analyst John Musk said: “We previously saw a lot of rhetoric around extending the windfall tax to generators when the energy profits levy was originally announced. It was seen as too difficult then – and I do not see how that changes.” However, industry watchers are confident that nuclear power stations have recorded hefty gains. British Gas owner Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet, which is operated by EDF. Centrica reported operating profits of £1.3bn, and noted an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated, in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 per megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/mwh. Centrica had flirted with selling off its nuclear stake, but that plan was ditched last year. EDF is also likely to have seen a fillip, however the gains may be overshadowed by the debt-laden company’s woes in France where it is being nationalised. UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) estimates that if 100% of eligible UK wind and solar power projects were to participate in the contracts’ revamp the saving would be £12.8bn and £180 off bills. UKERC estimates that if its proposals were extended to units 2 and 3 of Drax, which burn biomass and receive RO payments, the collective savings would be £14.8bn a year. If all of Britain’s nuclear power stations participated, overall savings would reach £22.4bn. Dan Monzani, managing director for the UK and Ireland at consultancy Aurora, said UKERC’s proposal could lower the price over the next two to three winters in exchange for a fixed price extending for the remainder of the stations’ technical life. “This would spread the impact of the war on Ukraine over more years,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T12:00:45Z","webTitle":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T23:01:33Z","webTitle":"China’s war chest: how Beijing is using its currency to insulate against future sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"China’s war chest: how Beijing is using its currency to insulate against future sanctions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For more than a decade, Beijing has been trying to reduce its reliance on the dollar, motivated by risks emerging from the US economy – such as the financial crash of 2008 – and the desire to boost its own sphere of influence. But in the last year, a drive to insulate China’s economy from dollar-based sanctions has emerged as possibly the most important incentive for decoupling from the dollar, as China looks to prepare for the possibility of conflict with Taiwan. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the most powerful tools for inflicting economic harm on Moscow was to essentially cut the country off from transactions based on US dollars, limiting its ability to trade with other countries. But as well as punishing the Kremlin, there has been an unintended winner from west’s sanctions regime: the Chinese yuan. Last year the share of Russian imports paid for in yuan rose from 4% to 23%. In February the yuan overtook the dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow exchange for the first time in its history. China’s push to boost the internationalisation of its currency predates the war in Ukraine and although the yuan is still far behind the dollar in terms of global activity, between March 2021 and March 2023 its share of the trade finance market – the multi-trillion dollar ecosystem that underpins 80% of world trade – more than doubled, according to data from Swift, an interbank messaging platform. China is also encouraging other countries to adopt the yuan for international transactions. Argentina and Brazil recently reached agreements to pay for Chinese imports in yuan rather than US dollars. In April Bangladesh announced that it had approved a payment in yuan worth $318m to settle part of a Russian loan that had been used to finance a nuclear power plant development. It is a rare example of the yuan being used for an international transaction that does not involve China. Daniel McDowell, a China fellow at The Wilson Center, a thinktank, said: “To date, international use of the RMB as a payment currency has primarily involved China on one end of the deal.” “To do business with Russia, foreign partners do not really have alternatives – they will have to consider using less traditional payment currencies, like RMB and rubles”. A defence against sanctions China’s economy is far more intertwined with the west’s than Russia’s is, and many analysts think it would be impossible for the west to punish China economically without inflicting massive self-harm. Still, China wants to protect itself as much as possible, and the internationalisation of the yuan is one part of that defence. In March, a Chinese company used yuan to buy 65,000 tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from TotalEnergies, a French multinational, the first time that China’s currency has been used in an international LNG transaction. Beijing does not want to be dependent on the use of dollars for essential imports, so this is a key step in ensuring China’s energy security. In an article published last year, Xu Jin, the chief economist at China Energy, a state-owned company, wrote that China “must work faster to drive the internationalisation of the RMB” in order to protect its energy supplies in the wake of sanctions on Russia. China has also developed an alternative to Swift as well as a digital currency, the e-CNY. These technological innovations are less important than the political factors that influence the yuan’s international popularity, but they are part of Beijing’s broad campaign to transform its currency into an attractive alternative to the dollar. The campaign to decouple from the dollar is also linked to national pride. A recent report on China’s quest for financial self-reliance notes: “By definition, China can’t claim to be a great power … if it continues to rely on the dollar for trade, foreign borrowing, and the pricing of energy and commodities.” But for China’s leaders, a more prominent international role for the yuan needs to be balanced against the party’s grip on domestic financial markets. Truly internationalising the yuan would mean loosening the government’s control over capital flows and allowing the market to play a bigger role in the currency’s valuation. That is not a risk that the party is willing to take, either politically or philosophically. A central tenet of its economic philosophy is that the state should have a prominent role in the economy. Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, notes: “It’s not the invisible hand,” that the party wants controlling the market, “it’s the very visible hand of the state regulators.” “A more prominent role for the RMB in the global financial system is a nice to have thing. But domestic financial stability is a must-have thing if you want to keep the country running and stay in power”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-14T19:07:51Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C: government reignites £20bn nuclear power station row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C: government reignites £20bn nuclear power station row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has reignited a row over Britain’s nuclear energy ambitions by agreeing to restart talks with EDF over plans to build a reactor at Sizewell C in Suffolk. The talks could lead to the government taking a direct financial stake in the project before the end of the current parliamentary term in 2024, and using a new financial model that would make the public liable for cost overruns. The formal negotiations over the £20bn nuclear plant will hinge on whether the French state-owned EDF can prove it has learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. If it succeeds it may be offered a multi-billion-pound deal that allows it to charge energy customers for the cost of construction while it builds the reactor, effectively putting bill payers on the hook for delays or cost overruns. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of “kicking big decisions into touch” and failing to offer a “definitive statement today one way or the other on financing, costs or an overall plan”. The decision to restart talks is also expected to reopen a debate over whether nuclear energy can offer good value for money, and whether the UK needs new nuclear reactors to help meet a steep rise in demand for low-carbon electricity to power a boom in electric vehicles, induction hobs and heat pumps. Sizewell is “a vital next step” in the UK’s efforts to secure new low-carbon electricity as older nuclear reactors prepare to shut down, according to the Nuclear Industry Association. It added that “an appropriate financing model” would help cut costs and unlock major benefits for the UK economy. The decision to restart formal negotiations follows a hiatus in talks that have been dogged by concerns over cost, and the involvement of China General Nuclear Power (CGN), which owns 20% of the project. But environmental campaigners, including Greenpeace, have warned that nuclear reactors are “unnecessary” and expensive compared with renewable energy combined with battery storage technology. The community group Stop Sizewell added that the reactor posed a risk to the natural habitats along the Suffolk coast and the nearby Minsmere nature reserve. “It’s good to see the government is determined to shift away from fossil fuels and create thousands of green jobs but building more nuclear power stations is not the way to do it,” said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace. “While ministers have been talking to EDF about Sizewell C for years, the offshore wind industry has got on with the job and delivered. If discussions with the majority French-state-owned company ever progressed, the UK public will need to stump up billions of pounds in advance. This money would be far better spent on a flexible grid that can handle the shedloads of cheap renewables increasingly powering the UK,” he said. The government said it would only consider playing a greater role in the Sizewell project if there was “clear value for money for consumers and taxpayers”. It is also planning to back a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors, or “mini nukes”, which can be built at a lower cost. The fresh Sizewell talks were announced alongside industry-wide plans to cut carbon emissions from the energy system while keeping a lid on energy bills and helping to create 220,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. Alok Sharma, the business and energy secretary, said the energy white paper released on Monday will transform the government’s “climate ambition into climate action” through a “decisive and permanent shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels”. The energy white paper also included proposals to cut energy bills, replace fossil fuel boilers, introduce a new emissions trading scheme in the UK and support the North Sea extraction industry in moving away from oil and gas. Sharma added: “At every step of the way, we will place affordability and fairness at the heart of our reforms – unleashing a wave of competition so consumers get the best deals possible on their bills, while protecting the vulnerable and fuel poor with additional financial support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-18T01:29:02Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 207 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 207 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, foreign minister of the Czech Republic. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with Chinese president Xi Jinping the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdogan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The security service of Ukraine said that Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region.

Thinktank Common Wealth has calculated that the cost of generating electricity to power homes and businesses could be reduced by £20.8bn or £252 per household a year under state ownership, according to a report seen by the Guardian. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has committed to creating “a publicly owned national champion in clean energy” named Great British Energy. Starmer is yet to lay out the exact structure of the mooted company, although he has said it would not involve nationalising existing assets, or become involved in the transmission or retail supply of energy. Starmer instead hopes to create a state-backed entity that would invest in clean energy – wind, solar, tidal, nuclear and other emerging technologies – creating jobs and ensuring windfalls from the growth in low carbon power feed back to the government. The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. MPs and campaigners have argued that Britain’s energy companies should be nationalised since the energy crisis, which has resulted in North Sea oil and gas producers and electricity generators making windfall profits, and a string of retail suppliers collapsing, costing taxpayers billions. Detractors of nationalisation in energy argue it can stifle innovation and expose taxpayers to huge financial risks. Common Wealth pointed out that more than 40% of the UK’s offshore wind generation capacity was publicly owned by overseas national entities, meaning the benefits of high electricity prices linked to the war in Ukraine had flowed back to other governments. The study found the publicly owned generator model would create more savings than other options, including a drive for voluntary CfDs; splitting the generation market between low carbon and fossil fuel sources and a “single buyer model” with nationalised retail suppliers. The Common Wealth director, Mathew Lawrence, said: “The energy system faces two acute challenges: the staggering profits being made by generators, and the need to rapidly decarbonise generation. “A publicly owned generator can address both these pressing issues, rebuilding out energy system around the public interest. That is the fastest, fairest, most effective way to build a clean, secure, affordable power system.” Starmer has cited the success of European energy firms with state backing including Sweden’s Vattenfall and Ørsted, which is part owned by the Danish state. The authors of the Common Wealth report argued that Great British Energy could be a “powerful tool” in decarbonising Britain, but said ambition akin to the creation of the NHS was needed to make a serious difference. “An approach to reform that does not go to the root of the upstream problems in our energy system, that does not build out at scale and instead remains a marginal actor in the transition, will be unable to deliver on its potential or, in the case of Great British Energy, its stated goals. In this context, timidity and incrementalism are the greatest risks, and ambition the safest path forward,” they wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T01:00:57Z","webTitle":"US attorney general confirms arrest of air national guardsman suspected of being behind intelligence leaks – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","fields":{"headline":"US attorney general confirms arrest of air national guardsman suspected of being behind intelligence leaks – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This blog is closing. You can find a summary of what we know about Jack Teixeira’s arrest here. Here, meanwhile, is the other Ukraine-related news over the last day: UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded Bakhmut, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Fragmentation of the global economy into rival trading blocs runs the risk of prompting a new cold war, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said a combination of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and shortcomings with globalisation had led to a potentially dangerous splintering. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. Norway will expel 15 Russian embassy officials who it said were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The European Union has added Russia’s Wagner group to its sanctions list for “actively participating in the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine”. The mercenary group had already been placed on another EU sanctions list in February for violating human rights and “destabilising” countries in Africa. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must be part of Ukraine again and a real peace will come by restoring the country’s borders, foreign minister Dmitro Kuleba has said on Thursday. “There is no difference between...any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has awarded £650m to manufacturers working on its Tempest fighter jet, in the latest sign that the UK is pushing forward with the aim of producing the aircraft by 2035. The Tempest programme is seen as a key part of the UK’s plans for defence spending and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put pressure on the government to increaseits investment. ExxonMobil handed its chief executive a 52% pay increase to $35.9m (£28.7m) for 2022 after the oil company reported its highest ever profits amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Darren Woods’ salary rose by 10% to $1.9m last year while his bonus and share awards surged by 80% compared with the year before. What kind of impact might the leaks have? The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. The Washington Post has spoken to a friend of Teixeira’s, who had this to say: Teixeira was a ‘pretty normal guy’ outside the server, said the friend, who eventually met Teixeira in person. He had a ‘slight temper’ and was ‘more of a mentor than a leader.’ Sharing the classified documents was meant ‘to educate people who he thought were his friends and could be trusted’ free from the propaganda swirling outside, the friend said. … ‘I was of the opinion that some of these kids were prone to run their mouths because they spent too much time online, but I was ignored,’ said the friend, who added that he tried to stay out of such discussions. ‘It was pretty obnoxious to see kids who grew up in the suburbs argue about a conflict an ocean away.’ … ‘He loved America but simply didn’t feel confident in its future,’ the friend said. ‘At the end of the day he would side with this country over any other.’ Other members of Teixeira’s server have showed The Post video of Teixeira shouting racist and antisemitic slurs before firing a rifle and said he referenced government raids at Ruby Ridge in Idaho and in Waco, Tex. – events with deep resonance among right-wing, anti-government extremists. The name of the Discord server itself derives from a meme taken from a gay porn video often used for its shock value and laughs, the members said. Here are the key developments in the Pentagon leaks story, and Teixeira’s arrest: The Department of Justice arrested 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online, US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. Teixeira was arrested at his home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts by FBI agents. Helicopter news footage showed a young man with shorn dark hair, an olive green T-shirt and red shorts being made to walk backwards towards a team of agents standing by an armoured vehicle dressed in camouflage and body armour, pointing their rifles at him. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. The likely charges could each carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm, said Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor. Among the clues that lead to Teixeira’s arrest was the kitchen countertop and floor tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. Teixeira is believed to have been the leader of an online chat group where hundreds of photographs of secret and top-secret documents were first uploaded, from late last year to March. The online group called itself Thug Shaker Central, made up of 20 to 30 young men and teenagers brought together by an enthusiasm for guns, military gear and video games. Racist language was a common feature of the group. Speaking in Ireland, Joe Biden sought to play down the impact of the breach. “I’m not concerned about the leak,” Biden said. “I’m concerned that it happened. But there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that’s of great consequence.” Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sought to cast Teixeira as a right-wing hero, writing on Twitter, “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Thursday that his country had not sold arms to Ukraine and would not do so, after a leaked Pentagon report said Belgrade had agreed to provide arms to Kyiv, according to foreign media reports. “Serbia has not nor it will export weapons to Ukraine,” Vucic told reporters, according to the Beta news agency. He added that the Balkan nation, a traditional Russian ally, “has not nor will it” send ammunition to either Ukraine or Russia. “There is no paper that would show something like that,” he added. Teixeira’s mother, Dawn, confirmed to the New York Times that her son was a member of the air national guard and said that recently he had been working overnight shifts at a base on Cape Cod, and in recent days he had changed his phone number. A number for Bayberry Farm and Flower Co, a flower business believed to be owned by Jack Teixeira’s mother, went to voicemail. A message said the business is closed this week. The company is based at the same North Dighton, Massachusetts, address where Teixeira is understood to live. It is owned by Dawn and Tom Dufault – public records show that Dawn Dufault was previously known as Dawn Teixeira. The company’s Facebook page had mentioned Jack Teixeira in June 2021. “Jack is on his way home today, tech school complete, ready to start his career in the Air National Guard!” a message said, under a photograph of a “Welcome home” balloon. Here is what we know about Teixeira: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, has posted a tweet painting Teixeira as a hero. “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime …Ask yourself who is the real enemy? A young low level national guardsmen? Or the administration that is waging war in Ukraine, a non-Nato nation, against nuclear Russia without war powers? Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod, Mass, the Air National Guard Base where Teixeira is stationed, states that its mission is to “provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control along with trained and experienced Airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security”. It hosts the 102nd Intelligence Wing, in which Teixeira worked. Here is how the arrest happened, according to the New York Times. Heavily armed FBI agents arrived outside Teixeira’s mother’s home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts, and started calling the 21-year-old’s name, according to a neighbour. Teixeria emerged, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, an was put in a van. Then, “Multiple sport-utility vehicles and an armored vehicle descended on the home, and agents wearing helmets and flak jackets and carrying military-style assault rifles entered the property on foot. Overhead, a twin-engine surveillance plane circled.” Teixeira will appear in court in Massachusetts on Friday, the Associated Press reports. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect raises questions about how such a profound breach could have been caused by a young, low-ranking service member. “We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. Among the ways that Teixeira was identified is through the kitchen countertop and tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor now with the law firm Morrison Foerster, said the likely charges could carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm. Several of Teixeira’s family members serve in the military, the New York Times reports, and the 21-year-old airman joined straight after highschool, in 2021. The paper has painted this portrait of the person suspected of leaking US intelligence documents online: While talking with friends online, Jack Teixeira…assumed the role of a leader. He guided a group of 20 to 30 people, mostly young men and teenagers, as they bonded over guns, racist memes, video games and international politics. … His friends in the online group, a Discord channel named Thug Shaker Central, said in interviews that it was a place that brought together lonely people during the pandemic. Sometimes, when they played war-themed video games, Airman Teixeira wanted to teach his friends about actual war, they said. Here is an image of his arrest earlier today: Hi, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our live coverage of the arrest of Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. If you have questions, comments or see news you may have missed, drop me a line on Twitter here. It is slightly past 5:30pm in Washington DC and 12:30pm Kyiv. Here are the day’s key developments so far: US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has arrested 21-year old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland.

Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. A congratulatory post by the 102nd Intelligence Wing about 21-year old Jack Teixeira last July is still currently up on its Facebook page. “Congratulations to some of the 102nd Intelligence Wing’s most recent promotees! Way to go!!” the post said, with Jack Teixeira’s name included on the post. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. Agence France-Presse reports: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Russian forces took control of the six-reactor plant in embattled southern Ukraine in March last year. “We are living on borrowed time when it comes to nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” Grossi said in a statement. “Unless we take action to protect the plant, our luck will sooner or later run out, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” he added. Two landmine explosions occurred outside the plant’s perimeter fence - the first on 8 April, and another four days later, according to the statement. It was not immediately clear what caused the blasts, it said. US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has arrested 21-year old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. “Teixeira is an employee of the United States Air Force National Guard. FBI agents took Teixeira into custody this afternoon without incident. He will have an initial appearance at the US District Court of the district of Massachusetts,” he added, thanking the FBI and the DOJ for their “diligent work on this case.” Garland said the investigation remains ongoing. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. The FBI said on Thursday it has “made an arrest and is continuing to conduct authorized law enforcement activity at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts,” amid reports that a suspect in the leak of classified information has been identified. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, will make a statement on the situation at 2.30pm, Reuters reports. Aerial footage released by Sky 5 shows a young man being arrested by a handful of federal agents. The young man can be seen with his hands on his head, clad in a T-shirt and shorts. “This is not just about the Department of Defense. This is about the US government…and how we protect and safeguard information,” said Ryder. “We do have strict protocols in place… Anytime there is an incident…an opportunity to refine it, we are of course going to take advantage of that,” he added. “We continue to work around the clock along with the inter-agency and intelligence community to understand the scope, scale and impact of these leaks,” Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder said in a press briefing on Thursday regarding the recent leaks of US intelligence online. “We will be limited in what we can say about the documents themselves … As a matter of longstanding policy, just because classified information may be posted online and elsewhere does not mean it has been declassified by classification authority,” added Ryder. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The FBI wants to question a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the leak of highly classified military documents on the Ukraine war, according to a report. The guardsman has been identified by the New York Times as 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, who reportedly oversaw an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded Bakhmut, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Germany has approved a request by Poland to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich after his trial. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, Kuleba said in an address to the Black Sea security conference. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata are “not regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats. Swedish prosecutors said they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic.

It comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident.

Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). Romania, Moldova and Ukraine have signed cooperation agreements after a trilateral meeting on ways to strengthen security in their Black Sea region to counter threats posed by Russia’s aggression. The three neighbouring countries’ foreign and defence ministers, government officials and international partners gathered today in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, for the Black Sea Security Conference. The aim was to address the wide-ranging impact that Moscow’s war in Ukraine on the region, AP reported. Russia was “the most direct and serious threat” to the Black Sea region and Nato, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said. Calling for a strong Nato presence in the region, he said: Instead of peace and stability, the Black Sea region has become the primary target of the Russian aggression. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who addressed the conference via videolink, also said the Nato military alliance should play a bigger role in security in the Black Sea, and integrate Ukraine’s air and missile defences with those of Nato members. Kuleba, referring to Finland’s recent admission to the alliance, said: It’s time to turn the Black Sea into what the Baltic Sea has become, a sea of Nato. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić, whose leads one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe, told reporters: Serbia has not and will not export weapons to Ukraine. He added that it equally “has not and will not” export arms or ammunition to Russia, adding: “There’s no document that can prove that.” The document seen by the Guardian is a roundup of European positions on providing arms and training from early March, titled “Response to Ongoing Russia-Ukraine Conflict”. It gives the “assessed position” of each country with a tick or a cross. Serbia is assessed to have “provided or committed to provide lethal aid”. It is also reported to have the “military ability” and the “political will” to provide arms in the future. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. He said: They saw one shell (in Ukraine), one bullet. So what, and where else would they appear? There are several war zones around the world. Serbia’s defence minister, Miloš Vučević, and foreign minister, Ivica Dačić, have also dismissed the contents of the leaked intelligence as untrue. Serbia is also the only European country to have opposed all sanctions against Russia. Vučić has sought to maintain ties with Moscow and Beijing while seeking not to alienate the US and EU entirely. His government has voted against Russia several times at the UN general assembly over its invasion of Ukraine. Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The disturbing clip appears to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. It is unclear when or where the video was shot. The video circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Maliar, during a briefing today, said: All cases and videos that appear in the public domain are being investigated, and this is being done by all law enforcement agencies together, who have the technical capabilities and relevant specialists and experts. A member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard suspected of leaking highly classified US intelligence documents will be arrested today in Massachusetts, Reuters is reporting, citing a source familiar with the situation. The FBI wants to question a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the disclosure of classified military documents, AP is citing two people familiar with the matter. As we reported earlier, the New York Times has named Jack Teixeira, 21, as the leader of the online group where the secret documents were posted. The leader of a small online gaming chat group where secret US intelligence documents were leaked is a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, the New York Times is reporting, citing interviews and documents it reviewed. The suspected leaker is Jack Teixeira, 21, who oversaw Thug Shaker Central, an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games, the Times said. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround Bakhmut from the north and the south, while Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded the embattled city in eastern Ukraine. The Bakhmut area remains the most difficult as Russian forces continue “offensive actions in the central part of Bakhmut, as well as in the directions of Bohdanivka and Ivanivske to surround the city from the north and south”, Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department, was quoted by Ukrinform as saying at a briefing on Thursday. He added: Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons. He said Russian forces had lost nearly 4,500 Wagner fighters and regular Russian armed forces servicemen who had been killed or wounded in the area of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian update came Moscow claimed Russian troops were preventing Ukrainian forces from entering or leaving Bakhmut. In a statement published on Thursday, the Russian defence ministry said: Airborne troops are providing support to advancing assault troops, blocking the transfer of Ukrainian army reserves to the city and the possibility of retreat for enemy units. Wagner assault units “were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of Bakhmut, the statement continued. But the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said it was “too early” to say that Bakhmut was surrounded. Ukraine has also denied the Russian ministry’s claims. Army spokesperson Sergiy Cherevaty said Ukrainian forces in the wartorn city were still able to “deliver provisions, ammunition, and medicines” and evacuate wounded troops in Bakhmut. Neither side’s claims have been independently verified. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, discussed the Ukraine crisis during a meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, today, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Qin told Lavrov that there was no “panacea” for resolving the crisis, the ministry said. He added that Beijing will continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement and restarting peace talks, the ministry said. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Prokudin, in a television broadcast, said: The army of the Russian Federation hit Zmiivka in Kherson region with guided aerial bombs, they hit a school and … one person was killed and another was wounded. In addition, a man was killed during the shelling of a park inside Kherson city early in the morning and another person was wounded in a village elsewhere in the region, he said. Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). The Khmelnitsky Orchestra was due to tour the UK this month with two shows: The Magical Music of Harry Potter, and The Music From the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit andThe Rings of Power. The shows had been promoted on the UK government website as an example of British-Ukrainian relations. After the orchestra played the Harry Potter show in Belgium last year, the deputy British ambassador in Brussels, Chloe Louter, hailed it as “an incredible honour to have such an iconic part of British culture being performed by a Ukrainian orchestra”. The promoter, Star Entertainment, has accused the UK government of hypocrisy. “They made a big deal out of supporting the Ukrainians but when it came to giving them visas to play in the UK, they didn’t want to know,” said its chief executive, Jaka Bizilj, who is known in the UK entertainment industry after working with Richard Curtis on two film projects and with Bob Geldof on the Cinema for Peace Foundation, which evacuated the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny from Siberia to Berlin. He called on the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, to stand down if artists keep being treated like this, saying the immigration difficulties experienced by an increasing number of foreign artists “damages UK citizens, culture and the relationship to Europe”. Read the full story here: Earlier we reported that Poland had requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. That request has now been approved, Germany’s defence ministry said. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Joe Biden has said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence services and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” the US president said. “But I don’t have an answer.” He added that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence”. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Poland has requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would respond on Thursday after consultations between his ministry, the chancellery and other stakeholders. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich after his trial. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, Kuleba said in an address to the Black Sea security conference. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata are “not regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats. Swedish prosecutors said they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister has said. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan,” Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council thinktank. A Ukrainian man was admitted to hospital this morning with life-threatening injuries after setting himself on fire outside the Ukrainian consulate in Krakow, Polish police said. The 63-year-old man was “standing in line outside the Ukrainian consulate ... when he started yelling something in Ukrainian, took out a bottle with a flammable substance, doused himself with it and set himself on fire”, a police press officer, Piotr Szpiech, told AFP. He added: An officer on patrol and a witness put out the fire. The man was taken to hospital in a serious, life-threatening condition. Initial media reports suggested the man had been urging fellow citizens to return to Ukraine and fight Russia, AFP said. Poland has requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would respond on Thursday after consultations between his ministry, the chancellery and other stakeholders. He told reporters: The promise is that a reply to our Polish partners will be forthcoming within the day. Swedish prosecutors said on Thursday they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” Reuters reports senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. “The information disclosure may hurt national security,” he added. Nelly Kronstrand reports for the Swedish news site Aftonbladet that “there is no suspicion that the man is connected to a foreign power”. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, on Thursday warned that the country’s new status as a Nato member “doesn’t solve every problem,” and said Helsinki should not let down its guard on security issues. “We still bear the main responsibility for our own security. Wherever we detect any gaps or vulnerabilities, they must be fixed,” Niinistö said, in a speech to lawmakers as they gathered for the first time since the 2 April elections. He added that Finland, which shares a 1,340km (832-mile) border with Russia, had been focused on regional security in the past year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We must not let this level of alertness drop in the future, either,” Associated Press reports the president said as he formally opened the 200-member Eduskunta legislature. “We should better understand how organically the dangers and tensions we are witnessing here are linked with the increasing geopolitical pressures.” If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister said on Thursday. “God forbid, if Ukraine falls, if Ukraine gets conquered, the next day China may attack Taiwan,” Reuters reports Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington DC. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan.” Joe Biden on Thursday said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence community and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” he said on answers. “But I don’t have an answer.” Speaking in Dublin, the US president said that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.” It was the first time Biden has commented publicly about the release of Pentagon documents that were posted on several social media sites. “I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence,” Associated Press reports Biden said while visiting Irish leaders. The documents appear to detail US and Nato aid to Ukraine and US intelligence assessments regarding US allies that could strain ties with those nations. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. The statement by the ministry said: Airborne troops are providing support to advancing assault troops, blocking the transfer of Ukrainian army reserves to the city and the possibility of retreat for enemy units. It added that “Wagner assault units were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of the city in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for the jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich after his trial. Ryabkov, speaking to the state-run Tass news agency, said talks about a possible exchange could take place through a dedicated channel for Russian and US security agencies. He said: We have a working channel that was used in the past to achieve concrete agreements, and these agreements were fulfilled. He stressed that Russia would negotiate on a possible exchange only after a court delivered its verdict in the espionage charge against Gershkovich. Here’s more on Norway’s decision to expel 15 Russian diplomats from the country who they said were suspected of spying while working at the Russian embassy in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata “must leave Norway within a short time”, Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said, adding: “We will not grant visas to intelligence officers who apply for a visa to Norway.” She said: We are not talking about regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests. She declined to say whether the expulsions were in response to a specific incident. The Norwegian government said the activities of the expelled diplomats were “incompatible with their diplomatic status”. The expulsions amount to a quarter of Russian diplomats currently accredited in Oslo, it said. After the Russian foreign ministry said Moscow would respond in kind to Norway’s action, Huitfeldt said: Russia has no reason to respond. We have Norwegian diplomats stationed in Russia, but none of them are undercover intelligence officers. She stressed, however, that Oslo wants “normal diplomatic relations with Russia, and that Russian diplomats are welcome in Norway”. Officials in Moscow’s Odintsovsky district have started printing volunteer military service pamphlets in the Tajik and Uzbek languages, Meduza’s Kevin Rothrock writes. It comes as Russia’s lower and upper houses of parliament approved legislation to tighten its conscription law before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The changes in legislation, which will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft, have fuelled speculation that Russia plans to announce a second wave of mobilisation, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. A large batch of leaked classified US government information, including top-secret briefings, have been discovered online over the past week, with many relating to perhaps the most sensitive arena of intelligence gathering in the world today: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The most significant parts of the leak concern Kyiv’s level of preparedness for an expected counteroffensive. US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. Read the full story here: Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. The disturbing video, which emerged on social media on Wednesday, appeared to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. A second video appeared to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian servicemen lying next to a destroyed military vehicle. In a statement posted to Telegram, the Russian general prosecutor’s office said: In order to assess the credibility of these materials and make an appropriate decision, they have been forwarded to the investigative authorities for verification. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters yesterday that the video was “awful” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of the footage. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. The initiative came from “hawks among top officials of Russia’s security services”, it said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: No, it is not the president’s prerogative, it is the special services who are doing their job. Once again, I would like to remind you that this journalist was caught red-handed. Gershkovich, 31, was detained on 29 March in the city of Ekaterinburg, and the Russian Security Service, FSB, admitted the following day that it had picked him up on suspicion of spying. He was later formally charged with espionage, which Gershkovich and the Wall Street Journal deny. On Tuesday, the US state department officially designated Gershkovich as being wrongfully detained, signalling that Washington views the espionage charges against him as bogus and that he is being held as a hostage. Here’s more from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kuleba, addressing the Black Sea security conference via video link, called the war in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe”. He said: We are united by UN charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, he said. Poland is “sceptical” about French attempts to organise talks between Ukraine and Russia, Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said. In a speech to parliament, Rau said: We do not see any signs that Russia is ready to revise its policy of territorial conquests ... the possible result of such talks cannot be any separate guarantees for Russia, apart from the observance of the norms of international law. His comments came a week after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, held talks with Xi Jinping in which he urged the Chinese leader to bring Russia “back to reason” over the war in Ukraine. After the meeting between Macron and Xi, the French president said his Chinese counterpart had “important words” on Ukraine. He said France and China agreed nuclear weapons should be excluded from the conflict. But just hours later in Moscow, a Russian government spokesperson said he saw no prospect for China to mediate in the Ukraine conflict and that Russia had “no other way” than to press on with its offensive. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo, claiming that they were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. In a statement, the ministry said: The government’s decision is in response to the changed security situation in Europe, which has led to an increased intelligence threat from Russia. The officers concerned “must leave Norway shortly”, it added. The Norwegian foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, said in a statement: This is an important step in countering, and reducing the level of, Russian intelligence activity in Norway, and thus in safeguarding our national interests. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats, state media reported. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. It named a citizen of Ukraine, Yuriy Denisov. The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed in a statement on Telegram that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side have shelled the plant, risking a nuclear accident. In its statement, Energoatom said: A Russian mine exploded near the control room of the fourth power unit at the ZNPP. The Russian occupiers continue to turn the ZNPP into a military base, mining the perimeter around the plant. And these actions cannot but have consequences. According to sources, an explosion rang out near the engine room of the fourth power unit. As the nuclear terrorists themselves stated, their mine detonated. The sounds of the explosion were heard by Ukrainian nuclear workers who continue to work at the ZNPP. However, the Russians tried to “pacify” the workers and quickly cover their tracks so that the IAEA experts would not see it. Europe’s largest nuclear facility continues to suffer from the arbitrariness of the Russian military and their henchmen, while Ukrainian personnel are desperately trying to maintain the nuclear and radiation safety of the entire continent. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that Russia has fined the Wikimedia Foundation a further 2m roubles ($24,500 / £19,500) for failing to remove what the authorities describe as “fake information” about Russia’s military. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. In a statement, Reuters reports Naftogaz described a ruling on Wednesday by The Hague’s arbitration tribunal at the permanent court of arbitration as a “key victory on the energy front”. “Despite Russia’s attempts to obstruct justice, the arbitration tribunal ordered Russia to compensate Naftogaz for losses of $5bn,” it said. Among the property seized by Russia, Suspilne reported, are the energy and gas transportation system as well as the company’s financial assets. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian demands are set out as: reconnecting Rosselkhozbank to the Swift payment service resuming supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and maintenance service lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, plus unblocking access to ports restoring the work of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilisers In the press release, Russia’s foreign ministry claims that the latest statements by the UN about the deal “distorts data and facts”, and that “despite all the grandiloquent statements made about global food security and assistance to countries in need, the Black Sea grain initiative has served Kyiv’s commercial exports exclusively in the interests of western countries.” The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. The Games in Krakow start on 21 June and run until 2 July, with 19 sports being held as Olympic qualifiers. The International Boxing Association (IBA) said the continental qualifier “totally contradicts” Olympic organisers’ recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to return to international competition. “For this reason, the European Games 2023 can no longer remain an IOC recognised qualifier for Paris 2024 and must be annulled,” Reuters reports it said. An air alert has been declared across all of Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. Quoting authorities, it writes that the attack was “prepared by a member of the Ukrainian sabotage and terrorist group, a citizen of Ukraine Yuriy Denisov, born in 1987, who, through an express delivery service through an intermediary, transferred to her in Moscow an explosive device camouflaged as a plaster bust of a military commissar.” Tass added “the procedure for putting him on the international wanted list has been initiated.” You may have seen that we are testing a new feature across some of the Guardian’s live blogs, including the Ukraine live blog, which allows you to contact the live blogger directly.

Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Reuters reports Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The US intelligence leak is also the subject of our First Edition newsletter today. My colleague Archie Bland sums up what we know so far from the leaks about major US allies: Ukraine: US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying that Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. Russia: The leaks suggest that the US has a remarkable level of insight into Russian military operations, with live information about the targets being attacked by Moscow and details of a plan to pay a bonus to soldiers who damage or destroy Nato tanks. Early this morning the New York Times reported (£) that a new batch of 27 pages shows that “the depth of the infighting inside the Russian government appears broader and deeper than previously understood”. There is also information on the Russian mercenary Wagner group’s plan to expand its operations in Haiti, as well as US use of advanced satellite imaging technology to gather intelligence on Russian forces. UK: One document suggests that 97 special forces operatives were in Ukraine in February and March – and 50 of them were British, Harry Taylor and Manisha Ganguly report. Their purpose there is not specified, but it is suggested that the special forces could form part of a coordinated Nato group. UN: Some documents seen by the BBC appear to describe private conversations between the UN secretary general António Guterres and his deputy about a deal to secure the export of grain from Ukraine to help tackle a global food crisis. The files reportedly suggest that the US felt Guterres was too sympathetic to Russian interests, saying that he was “undermining broader efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Ukraine”. South Korea: Documents based in part on intercepted communications show Seoul grappling with US pressure to ship ammunition to Ukraine and concerns that artillery shells requested by Washington for its own use could end up being passed on. South Korea has a longstanding policy of not providing lethal weapons to countries at war. Israel: Another document says that the Mossad intelligence agency encouraged its staff to take part in protests over Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial plans to weaken the independence of the country’s judiciary. Mossad has denied those claims. There is also an assessment of scenarios in which Israel could be persuaded to provide weapons to Ukraine. Overnight the Times of London has reported that MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak of classified US intelligence documents. It writes: Tobias Ellwood, [the Conservative MP] who chairs the defence select committee, said the US leaks could “endanger lives”. “Given our long-established lead in scale and capability when it comes to elite forces it will come as no surprise that our special forces are doing much of the heavy lifting,” he said. “But this deliberate large-scale disclosure of sensitive material could easily endanger lives and should prompt an urgent review about who has access to sensitive information and how it is shared.” Dan Jarvis, the [opposition] Labour MP for Barnsley Central and a former special forces commander in Afghanistan, said the operations were “by necessity shrouded in secrecy”. He added: “Any compromise of secret material regarding their deployment or numerical strength is not only politically embarrassing but also militarily disadvantageous. It risks jeopardising the security and effectiveness of those operations and could put lives at risk.” All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. “There is no difference between … any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” Reuters reports he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. Kuleba also said everyone in Ukraine was “devastated” by the “horrific” video that had emerged appearing to show Russian forces beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this update on overnight events in Ukraine. It writes: At night, Russian troops attacked Slovyansk in Donetsk region with S-300 missiles: the school, residential buildings and the city water canal were damaged. In the past day, one person died in the region, and two others were injured. In the occupied Donetsk region, the Russian military has strengthened local inspections and filtering, increasing the number of checkpoints and patrols in order to hide information about the location of the Russian army, the Ukrainian general staff reported. 46 times from heavy artillery, drones and aviation, the Russian army shelled Kherson oblast yesterday: one person died, two were injured. AFP have spoken to Vitaliy Sydor, a Ukrainian farmer who has resorted to desperate measures to clear explosives from the land himself so he can plant crops. “I bought metal detectors and had a bit of a look on the internet,” said Sydor, 28, about his attempts to render the land usable. He had no protective equipment, he admitted, and relies on a friend with army experience. His village, Novohryhorivka, in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region, was within sight of the Russian frontline and heavily bombarded from March to November last year until the Russians retreated. “Wherever you look there are holes,” said Sydor, indicating the shattered outbuildings and machinery. International demining organisations and military and police sappers are out in force, but the area is vast and some farmers, needing to recoup huge losses, are taking clearance into their own hands. “You can wait a long time. No one knows when they will come and demine everything,” said Sydor, adding that he exchanges information online with other farmers on finding munitions. An estimated half of Mykolaiv region’s agricultural land will go unused this year “due to contamination or fear of contamination”, said Jasmine Dann, regional operations manager for demining charity the Halo Trust, which is working in the region. Sydor’s do-it-yourself approach carries “very big risks”, she said. “There is not only the risk that something will be missed but also that the mines might be booby trapped,” she warned.“Other explosives can be very unstable and explode if tampered with.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang, alongside the foreign minister of Iran, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and minister of state for foreign affairs of Pakistan, Hina Rabbani Khar. Russia has so far offered a muted response to the document leaks. The deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, suggested on Wednesday that the leak might be a US disinformation ploy. “Since the US is a party to the conflict and is essentially waging a hybrid war against us, it is possible that such techniques are being used to deceive their opponent, the Russian Federation,” Ryabkov told Russian news agencies. The Ukrainian government is assessing the possible damage from the disclosures. The files give details of 12 newly formed brigades, equipped with western battle tanks and armoured vehicles, which are likely to lead the assault against dug-in Russian positions. “For sure, people are not happy,” one official admitted on Wednesday. “Ukraine was criticised last year for not being a trustworthy partner. At the beginning of the invasion, we weren’t provided with weapons because of this lack of trust. We lost a lot of territory and people as a result. This perception was wrong. And now this leakage happens from the US side.” It was too early to say whether the leak would affect planning for Ukraine’s counter-offensive, now at an advanced stage, the official indicated. The attack is widely expected to take place in the south of the country, and possibly in the east as well. Ukraine’s goal is to break the land corridor connecting Crimea with Donetsk province and to evict the Russians from the occupied city of Melitopol and the port of Berdiansk. The World Bank said on Wednesday it would finance $200m to help fix Ukraine’s energy and heating infrastructure, with partners and others to provide another $300m as the project expands. The $200m grant will be used to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment, the World Bank said in a statement. The World Bank has mobilised more than $23bn in emergency financing for Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors. More than $20 billion of this has been disbursed through several projects, it said. Energy infrastructure has suffered $11bn in damage over the last year and is one of the most critical areas where Ukraine needs urgent support, said Anna Bjerde, World Bank’s managing director of operations, on Wednesday. During the fall and winter months, more than half of Ukraine’s power infrastructure was damaged, resulting in countrywide power outages that contributed to food, heating and water shortages, the World Bank said. There is increasing evidence that the intelligence leak was not an intelligence operation by a state actor aiming to discredit the US, but more likely the consequence of a Pentagon policy of granting top secret security clearances to huge numbers of service members, civilians and contractors. The number of employees and contractors in the entire US government with top secret clearance is about 1.25 million. OG appears to have acted as a leader on a server originally set up in 2020 on the Discord messaging platform by a small group of gun enthusiasts and gamers. The group went by several names, but most often it was known as Thug Shaker Central. Starting last year, OG is reported to have posted the documents on a channel on the server he named “Bear vs Pig”, a reference to the Ukraine war but also a viral video showing pigs fighting off a black bear. According to the teenage member of the group interviewed by the Post, OG “had a dark view of the government”, portraying the government, and particularly law enforcement and the intelligence agencies, as a repressive force. He ranted about “government overreach”. The Post said details were confirmed anonymously by other members of the group, and that it had viewed a total 300 photographs of classified documents, three times the number previously thought to be circulating. The origins of the leaks on Thug Shaker Central was first reported on Sunday by the Bellingcat investigative journalism group, which also interviewed the same member, who is under 18. However, the Washington Post said the teen member, who had been in touch with OG “in the past few days” had yet to be interviewed by any federal law enforcement officials by the time of publication on Wednesday night, even though the justice department began a criminal investigation and an FBI manhunt was launched at the beginning of the week. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has vowed to “turn over every rock” in pursuit of the leaker. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. The Washington Post interviewed a teenage member of the group, who described the man, referred to by the initials “OG”, from their online correspondence, and shared photographs and videos. The Post also viewed a video of a man identified as OG at a shooting range with a large rifle. “He yells a series of racial and antisemitic slurs into the camera, then fires several rounds at a target,” the report said. OG told fellow members of the same internet group that he worked on a military base, which was not named in the report, where his job involved viewing large amounts of classified information. The leaked documents have laid bare secrets about Ukraine’s preparations for a spring counter-offensive, US spying on allies such as Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, and the tensions between Washington and allied capitals over arming Kyiv. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: the person who leaked US classified documents prompting a national security investigation is a gun enthusiast in his 20s who worked on a military base, the Washington Post reports, citing fellow members of an online chat group. And the World Bank has announced it will finance $200m to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment. Here are the other key recent developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international leaders to act after a disturbing video emerged on Wednesday of Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. Ukraine’s president said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. Belarus has extradited a Russian man who was separated from his daughter and sentenced to two years in prison after she drew anti-war pictures at school. Alexei Moskalyov, a 54-year-old single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, fled house arrest last month, hours before a court handed him a two-year sentence for “discrediting” the Russian army. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, a spokesperson said, while the UN said it was “appalled by particularly gruesome videos” circulating on social media. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the “financial fixers” who have allegedly helped Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov hide their assets. Britain is ready to provide an extra $500 million of loan guarantees to Ukraine, taking the total this year to $1bn, British finance minister Jeremy Hunt said on Wednesday. Hunt said the British loan guarantees had been important to underwrite a broader $15.6 billion IMF four-year package of support. The US also imposed sanctions on more than 120 individuals and entities around the world over their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted people and entities across more than 20 countries and jurisdictions. Russia has hit 333 Canadian officials and public figures with sanctions in what it said was a tit-for-tat move in response to Canada’s sanctions against Moscow and support for Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has again rejected claims by Russia that Russian troops have captured more than 80% of the embattled city of Bakhmut. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern military command, insisted on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces controlled “considerably” more than 20% of it in the east. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck Ukrainian army reserves attempting to break through to Bakhmut. It also claimed that fighters from Russia’s private Wagner mercenary group had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the city. The claims were not verified. Russia has tightened its conscription law, including introducing electronic military draft papers, before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The lower and upper houses of parliament rushed through legislation that will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft while automatically banning registered conscripts from leaving the country. Russian-installed authorities in annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled traditional military parades to celebrate Victory Day and May Day, the Russian-appointed leader of Crimea has said, citing security reasons. Sergei Aksyonov’s statement on Wednesday came a day after he said Crimea was on guard and that Russian forces had built “modern, in-depth defences”. Serbia has agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already, according to a classified Pentagon document. Serbia is one of the only countries in Europe that has refused to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. South Korea has reportedly agreed to “lend” the US 500,000 rounds of artillery, as Seoul attempts to minimise the possibility that the ammunition could end up in Ukraine - a move that could spark domestic criticism of President Yoon Suk-yeol. South Africa has said that an international arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war was a “spanner in the works” before a Brics summit in the country in August. The Russian president is due to attend a summit of Brics countries but the host nation is a member of the International Criminal Court and would be expected to make the arrest if Putin steps foot in the country. The German government is very worried about the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s worsening health condition, a government spokesperson has said. Navalny’s spokesperson on Tuesday said he had lost 8kg in 16 days while in solitary confinement, and that he was not receiving any treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T18:04:05Z","webTitle":"Dam collapse a global problem as waters may poison Black Sea, Zelenskiy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Dam collapse a global problem as waters may poison Black Sea, Zelenskiy says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the ecological disaster triggered by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam has become a global problem as severely contaminated waters flow into the Black Sea. The Ukrainian president said the flood waters raging through the lower Dnipro River valley brought with them sewage, oil, chemicals and possibly anthrax from animal burial sites. “At least two anthrax burial places are in the temporarily occupied territories,” Zelenskiy said through an interpreter in an online discussion with environmental activists. “What is happening to those sites we do not know yet.” Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam on Tuesday morning and thereby committing ecocide. As well as the 100,000 people affected downstream, Zelinskiy said 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres) of forests had been flooded, and 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. “Altogether 2 million living beings are in danger,” Zelenskiy said, warning that as the contaminated water spreads, so would the environmental devastation. “The poisoning and contamination coming from the flooding area goes to the groundwater almost immediately, poisoning rivers and then the water basin of the Black Sea,” he said. “So it’s not happening somewhere else. It is all interrelated in the world.” Zelenskiy was speaking amid growing concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, about 125 miles (200km) upstream from the dam. The plant has drawn on the Kakhova reservoir to cool its reactor cores and spent fuel, but the reservoir is now rapidly draining into the lower Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said there is no immediate risk to the plant because it has water reserves, particularly a large cooling pond. However, a report by the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has said that earlier studies suggested the dyke around the cooling pond could collapse under the pressure of the water in it if the depth of the reservoir on the other side of the dyke dipped below 10 metres. It is currently below 13 metres and falling. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs were limited and in an emergency could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou said. However, nuclear experts warned the safety of the plant would then be extremely fragile. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy corporation, said the destruction of the dam meant the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant could also be under threat of Russian sabotage. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. The relief effort on the Ukrainian-held right bank of the Dnipro continued on Thursday, as the official death toll rose to six. One person was killed and two injured as displaced people and relief workers came under artillery fire from the Russian side of the river. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy had criticised the UN and the Red Cross for failing to support the flood relief effort. On Thursday evening, he thanked international organisations for their help on the right bank but said they still had no presence in the Russian-occupied area where people were still trapped. As Ukraine struggled to contain the damage of the dam collapse on Thursday, fighting was intensifying along the frontline with Russian occupation forces. In particular, a substantial Ukrainian force, reportedly including western tanks and other equipment, appeared to be making a concerted push south of the city of Zaporizhzhia towards a Russian logistics hub in the town of Tokmak. The US press quoted unnamed US and Ukrainian officials as saying that Kyiv’s long-awaited counteroffensive had begun, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff said: “We have no such information.” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine’s hydro power corporation Ukrhydroenergo, which oversees the Kakhova dam, said the left bank would have to be liberated before reconstruction work could begin, but plans were already being drawn up in anticipation. “Water is continually flowing over it and destroying the foundation. Only when the water has calmed will we be able to see the extent of the destruction,” Syrota told the Guardian. He thought that would take 10 days. He said the next step would be to build a 15 metre-high buffer dam upstream of the ruined hydroelectric station so that work could start on building a new one. “It will take us four months to make the [buffer dam],” he said. “But we can start the work only after the liberation of this territory.” In a later interview with Ukrainian media, Syrota, said the construction time for the new buffer dam could be halved to two months “provided that we work 24/7”. Syrota dismissed suggestions that the dam could have been destroyed as result of partial damage that led to catastrophic structural failure, calling them Russian propaganda. “The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,” Syrota said. “To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.” He added: “In October 2022, the Russians kicked all the workers out of the station, and from then the facility produced no energy. It became just a fortification for the Russian military. They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined. The Russians were just waiting for right day to blow it up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/06/the-coalition-didnt-do-much-on-nuclear-energy-while-in-office-why-are-they-talking-about-it-now","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T06:07:37Z","webTitle":"The Coalition didn’t do much on nuclear energy while in office.

Why are they talking about it now?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, the Nationals’ new leader, David Littleproud, said it was time for Australia to have a “mature” conversation about nuclear energy while his predecessor, Barnaby Joyce, called for a national moratorium to be lifted and argued nuclear power would be “really important” if the country was serious about reaching net zero emissions. On Sunday, the nuclear power advocate Ted O’Brien was appointed as the Coalition’s climate change and energy spokesperson. In an interview with ABC Radio National, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he was “not afraid to have a discussion on nuclear” as the country should not be afraid to “talk about any technology that’s going to have the ability to reduce emissions and electricity prices”. He suggested nuclear had been ruled out because it was “unfashionable” to talk about it. So why is the Coalition talking about nuclear energy again? Because despite having not made a serious attempt to start a nuclear power industry in its nine years in government, the Coalition has decided to argue for one immediately after losing power. Meanwhile, the Institute of Public Affairs, a rightwing group with a history of climate science denial that is supported by fossil fuel and mining interests, released what it described as polling showing people were open to the idea of nuclear energy. News Corp newspapers ran its arguments uncritically. Did anything happen while the Coalition was in government? There was an inquiry. In 2019, the former energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor referred the issue to a parliamentary committee; O’Brien was the chair. In a report titled “Not without your approval”, he and other Coalition MPs recommended the government consider partially lifting the ban for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”, expressing hope that what are known as small modular reactors (SMRs) could have a future. There was no appetite to allow the big nuclear plants that have become synonymous with catastrophic accidents at Fukushima and Chernobyl. O’Brien argued development of a potential nuclear industry would take time and should be conditional on a government assessment of technology and the informed consent of local communities. While this received some support from other Coalition MPs, Scott Morrison said the country’s position on nuclear power would not change without bipartisan support. Labor has ruled that out on economic and safety grounds. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Has the case for nuclear changed since 2019? Not significantly. Advocates have acknowledged nuclear power is the most capital-intensive energy technology, takes the longest time to recoup on investment and has not benefited from the economies of scale experienced in solar and wind energy. Costs have increased as technology has advanced. Despite the global push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the large-scale nuclear energy industry is going backwards. More units closed than opened in 2020. Construction began on only five reactors; four of those were in China, which is investing in all energy types. Excluding China, global nuclear generation is at its lowest level in 27 years. The few major plants under construction in developed democracies have suffered years of delays and cost blowouts. In the UK, the Hinkley Point C station – the country’s first new nuclear plant in decades – is running 10 years behind schedule and is expected to cost at least A$45bn, nearly 50% more than initially expected. What about SMRs? At this point they barely exist. SMRs are proposed to be 60 and about 200 megawatts, a fraction of the size of the traditional nuclear plant. Proponents say they would employ similar technology used in nuclear-powered submarines and icebreakers and would be easier to keep safe than bigger plants. But the world nuclear industry status report, compiled last year by nuclear energy opponents with a forward by the former Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan, suggested talk and media coverage about SMRs was “not reflected by any major industrial achievements on the ground”. It said SMRs in China and Argentina had been beset by delays. Chinese media said its first 200MW SMR unit was connected to the grid in December for an undisclosed price. The report said there had been no concrete steps towards construction anywhere else except Russia – which is pursuing a model that barely qualifies as an SMR, is years behind schedule and does not have the regulatory process expected in developed countries. In South Korea, an SMR model was approved in 2012 but there had been no orders because it costs too much. Plans in the US slowed; a government-backed model by the company NuScale was approved by the safety regulator, but the design was later changed and several public utilities dropped plans to invest in the technology. NuScale is now pursuing deals in eastern Europe. Backers agree that no reactors are expected before 2029 at the earliest. The report concluded there was growing evidence that “SMRs, like large reactors, will continue to be subject to delays and cost overruns and the high likelihood that they would not be economical even under the most favourable circumstances”. Is nuclear power needed in Australia? It is a different story in some other countries, but there are plenty of analyses that say nuclear energy isn’t necessary, and is highly unlikely to be able to compete, given the range of other options in Australia. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan – a blueprint for an optimal future grid – lays out a vision under which the country would run overwhelmingly on solar and wind, supported by better transmission links and backed by “firm” capacity that can be called on when needed: batteries, pumped hydro, some gas (at least initially) and demand management. Even under the most optimistic scenarios for nuclear, most of the transformation would be expected to happen before SMRs became available. While estimates are difficult, CSIRO’s latest analysis of different energy costs suggested that SMRs would continue to be far more expensive than solar and wind energy and at least as expensive as fossil fuel power with carbon capture and storage, which has not proven economically viable. Why does the case for nuclear energy persist? There is an assumption by some people, including Coalition MPs, that renewable energy cannot do the job, despite the expert advice that says otherwise. These critiques rarely address that advice head on. But there is also a long history of nuclear energy being used as a delaying tactic for acting on climate change in Australia, including by fossil fuel interests. It is possible SMRs could play a role globally beyond 2030, but anyone arguing for them in Australia should be asked why they disagree with the nuclear advocates who say otherwise – and why they their efforts aren’t better directed into backing zero-emissions technologies that are affordable and available now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-30T01:16:06Z","webTitle":"Net zero nuance: commentary on decarbonising the grid misses the mark on batteries and nuclear | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Net zero nuance: commentary on decarbonising the grid misses the mark on batteries and nuclear","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Commentary on decarbonising Australia’s electricity network seems to be heading towards net zero nuance, with questionable claims about the costs of batteries and nuclear power in the past week. One claim relies on an estimate of the cost of a multibillion-dollar nuclear plant that doesn’t exist yet, and another puts a multitrillion-dollar figure against the cost of building batteries. First to nuclear power, which, we should remember, has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s. On page three of the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, columnist Piers Akerman wrote an “exclusive” news story showing “nuclear energy is cheaper” than coal, gas, solar or wind. Such a claim would overturn pretty much all serious analysis of electricity costs around the globe. So where did it come from? The International Energy Agency maybe, or perhaps the CSIRO? No. Akerman quoted “new data” from Tony Irwin, who is a nuclear industry veteran and a technical director at a consultancy company with “specialist industry knowledge on the procurement and development of nuclear technologies” with a focus on small modular reactors (SMR). According to Akerman, Irwin’s data showed “nuclear-generated power” costs $5,596/kW to build, compared with $14,882 for large-scale solar, $12,372 for wind and about $10,000 for coal and gas, both with carbon capture and storage attached. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, who wants to see nuclear power considered in Australia, tweeted a link to the story saying: “Perhaps nuclear isn’t a dirty word after all?” But one problem with using Irwin’s numbers is they are based on an estimate of the cost of one particular SMR design which has not yet been built and won’t produce power until at least 2029. The estimate comes from a US-based company that’s trying to build its SMR in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems which has budgeted more than $8.5bn for the plant. In 2020, the US Department of Energy approved up to $2bn of funding to back it. SMRs have not yet been commercialised. The name might suggest they’re neat and off-the-shelf, but while dozens of designs and development projects are in existence, they are not something any government can currently go out and buy and plug into their electricity grids. Irwin told Temperature Check the numbers had been published on the consultancy’s website in October 2021, and provided a link. His calculations included “adjustments” for the percentage of time each type can produce electricity, the lifetime of plants and how flexible they are, which significantly pushes up the cost of all other forms of electricity except SMR nuclear. The CSIRO’s latest draft of its GenCost report that explores how much different electricity sources will cost says there is no prospect of an SMR plant being built in Australia before 2030. By then, it estimated a cost of between $7,700/kW and about $17,000/kW – at least five times the cost of large-scale solar in 2030. The GenCost report says, by 2030, the costs of other electricity generation and supply – including large-scale solar, wind and especially batteries – will have dropped even further. The secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Institute of Energy, Glenne Drover, who is a broad supporter of nuclear power, told Temperature Check the costs of SMR reactors were “still speculative” and it would take about five years before the actual costs became clearer. He said nuclear power “should play a vital role in decarbonisation for countries that are not blessed with the space, wind and sun that Australia has”. “So we might never need it, but we probably need to wait to 2030 to see how the renewables decarbonisation plan is going.” Dud battery charge Would it really cost $6.5tn to power Australia only on batteries, and are any electricity system experts seriously suggesting that’s what they’re for? The short answers are no, and no. Yet this figure has been used at least twice in commentaries this month. In a column arguing “the transition to net zero emissions will be hard and expensive”, the Nine News political editor, Chris Uhlmann, said whatever technology was used to support renewables “won’t be cheap” and pointed to a report that “calculated the cost of battery storage for Australia at $6.5tn”. Last week, Claire Lehmann, a columnist in the Australian wrote: “The battery storage required to power the whole of Australia has been estimated to cost $6.5tn. If this is a cost-effective solution, then God help us all.” So what’s the basis for this claim? The figure comes from a 2019 report from Industry Super Australia. The authors took the cost of South Australia’s Tesla battery and, in a back-of-envelope calculation, extrapolated that battery’s capacity until it could power the entire electricity grid for a day and a half. That was 7.5TWh of electricity, the report claimed, although the authors said they were not suggesting “any attempt should be made to provide all back-up using batteries”. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of Melbourne, said the use of the number was a “strawman”, adding: “I can’t believe anyone still takes it remotely seriously.” The Australian Energy Market Operator’s draft plan to decarbonise the national electricity market has said that by 2050, Australia will need about 620GWh of storage – which includes all storage technologies, including batteries and dams. Expressed another way, that’s about 12 times less electricity than the figure being plucked from the Industry Super report. McConnell said: “There is no justification for the requirement to store the entire grid’s worth of energy for 1.5 days. If that was a legitimate requirement, you wouldn’t try and meet that requirement with only lithium-ion batteries.” Very bad paleo diet Fossil fuels advocate Alex Epstein, a regular guest on Sky News Australia, last week enraged the climate science community by tweeting a chart tracking CO2 levels going back hundreds of millions of years in Earth’s history. The all-time high is somewhere around 6,000 parts per million (current levels are 420ppm). Epstein said it would take emissions increasing until well past the year 2100 for levels to get to even a quarter of that level, and before which “we can expect to have ultra-cost-effective non-carbon nuclear energy”. Regardless of what happens with nuclear energy, an important question to ask is what else could the planet expect if CO2 levels got up to 1,500 ppm? Dr Georgy Falster, a paleoclimate scientist at the Australian National University, told Temperature Check: “The last time the atmospheric CO2 concentration might have been as high as 1,500ppm – about 3.5 times higher than it is today – was during the mid-cretaceous period, around 100m years ago. “The paleo record suggests that at this time, the average global temperature was around 15C to 20C hotter than present – that’s at least double what it is today,” Falster said. “Global sea level was on average 75 to 250 metres higher than present-day mean sea level.” Dr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at the University of Wollongong, said at just 1.5C to 2C of warming, “there will already be catastrophic consequences to many natural ecosystems and humankind”. Recreating ancient climates with spiralling CO2 levels today would mean “practically every coastal city on Earth would be flooded and human communities would be decimated”, Henley said. Epstein may be hoping those cheap nuclear power plants will be able to operate underwater, providing there are enough humans left that need air-conditioners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/09/tories-decade-fossil-fuel-profits-insulation-fracking-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T11:57:18Z","webTitle":"The Tories spent a decade putting fossil fuel profits first.

Now we’re all paying the price","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the full horror of the gathering energy crisis takes shape and the party of austerity prepares to borrow £150bn just to pay the bills, government ministers are desperate for you to remember one thing: it is all Vladimir Putin’s fault. Although the terrifying spike in gas prices is driven by the economic war Putin is waging on Europe, the emergency we face this winter is not simply a product of those high prices. It’s also a product of successive Conservative governments wilfully dismissing policies that would have reduced our reliance on gas in the first place. Take insulating homes and buildings. The past decade has been a period of dismal neglect for one of the most economically obvious policies. Report after report, campaign after campaign, year after year, governments have been reminded of the prudence of investing to make our buildings cheaper and cleaner to heat. Direct grants for those on low incomes, financial support for households and private firms, and properly funded schemes for the public sector could have ended the UK’s reign as the least insulated country in western Europe. Adopting these policies would have cost less than £5bn, and returned money to the Treasury over time through myriad economic benefits, even before gas prices skyrocketed. Yet it seemed there was no one ministers would listen to. They ignored recommendations from the Committee on Climate Change (the government’s official advisers), NGOs, the National Infrastructure Commission and the opposition. The result has been a staggering 85% decline in home insulation installations between 2012 and 2019. Under current plans, it will take 700 years to upgrade Britain’s homes for low-carbon heating. After a decade of inaction, we are now paying the price of remaining so dependent on gas. Successive governments have also ignored the benefits of cheap renewable energy. It is not news that wind and solar power are cheap. This was already the case in 2015, when David Cameron’s government banned new onshore wind farms and pulled the rug from underneath the solar industry. In absolute terms, the cost of solar has fallen by 88% since 2010 and onshore wind has fallen 57%, despite both being intentionally frozen out of new deployment. In relative terms, the numbers are now staggering: building a new solar or windfarm is now nine times cheaper than just running an existing gas power station. The government should be given credit for supporting the extraordinary success of offshore wind in recent years. But there was nothing to stop the rapid rollout of onshore wind and solar at the same time. Had this happened, we would have much more cheap, homegrown and clean energy available right now to ride out this storm. Had the Conservatives not “cut the green crap” over the past decade, households would now be saving an average £220 on their annual energy bills. This figure will probably rise further as gas prices do the same. Imagine what a genuine commitment to energy transition could have achieved. Instead, false solutions won the day. Chief among these was fracking. Despite plummeting levels of public support and repeated warnings from experts that a UK fracking industry would do nothing to lower bills, fracking retained mythical status among Conservative administrations. The dogged pursuit of an industry that went nowhere has wasted precious time and obscured the real solutions at hand. The obsession with getting every last drop out of the North Sea oil and gas industry has replicated a disastrous logic among Conservative ministers. The North Sea fields are in decline for a very simple reason – we’ve extracted, sold and burned most of what was there. Going after what is left will do nothing to lower gas bills because our reserves are a drop in the ocean of global gas prices. Carrying on with fracking regardless, as Liz Truss intends to do, will not lower energy bills – it will merely undermine the UK’s ability to lead on climate action. And then there is nuclear power. Nuclear power produces carbon-free electricity, but it is very slow and relatively expensive to deliver. Hinkley Point C, the first in a supposed new generation of UK nuclear power stations, won’t open for (at best) another four years. It will be a minimum of £5bn over budget. If gas prices never return to pre-2021 levels, Hinkley won’t look like a terrible deal for consumers. But we still have the present situation to deal with. If the political enthusiasm for Hinkley had instead been directed at cheap renewables and insulation, we would be feeling the benefits already. There is a depressingly tired story behind these failures: the power of vested interests. The access of frackers and drillers to the highest levels of the Conservative party since 2010 has left us with an irrational energy policy. Instead of reducing our energy consumption through insulation, and servicing our needs with cheap, domestic renewables running on the sun and the wind, British energy policies have sought to secure the profits of companies. These energy companies have no interest in realising a truly modern, clean and reliable energy system we could all depend on. Borrowing £150bn just to cap energy bills at already historic levels – with most of it going to oil and gas producers – is just the start of the pain. We are ruled by a party that thinks the answer to a fossil-fuelled crisis is more fossil fuels. It is incapable of governing the basis of any economy – the energy system.

There were no casualties or injured reported. Landings and takeoffs at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport were restricted “for technical reasons beyond the control of the airport,” Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency said. A number of flights were diverted to other airports. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Tuesday that Ukraine attempted to strike civil infrastructure, including the airport, which amounted to an “act of terrorism”. Over 18,000 civilians have been recorded as casualties inside Ukraine by the UN since Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country began in February 2022. Nato members have agreed to extend the term of secretary general Jens Stoltenberg for a further year. The former prime minister of Norway has been in the role since 2014. In a statement on social media he said he was “honoured” and that “in a more dangerous world, our alliance is more important than ever”. US president, Joe Biden, welcomed the decision, saying “his steady leadership, experience, and judgment has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since the second world war.” Hungary’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that he had been in touch with his Turkish counterpart about a ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership, and if there is a shift in Turkey’s stance then Hungary will not delay the process. Russian President Vladimir Putin has told a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that the world faces an increasing risk of conflict due to economic and financial instability, and thanked the leaders of China and India for their support during the recent Wagner mutiny in the country. Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain initiative, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement. A proposal by the UN to set up a special communications channel between JP Morgan and Russia’s state agricultural bank is not a valid alternative to reconnecting the bank to the international Swift payments system, the foreign ministry said Suspilne reports that a man and a woman were killed Tuesday morning in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson. Additionally, three people have been injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv oblast. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that the Ukrainian power line connected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been cut off. It cited Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of the Rosenergoatom. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she was killed by injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk. 12 people were killed in the attack, including children. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of her country in 2022, Amelina set aside most of her writing to document and research war crimes. A prominent Russian journalist and a lawyer were attacked and suffered serious injuries after several masked men in the Russian region of Chechnya forced their car to stop on Tuesday. Journalist Elena Milashina had her head shaved, several fingers broken, and was covered with green dye in the attack, according to human rights group Memorial. The well-known journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper was travelling to the Chechen capital Grozny from the local airport with lawyer Alexander Nemov, when they were attacked. Reports said Nemov had been stabbed in the leg, and that their attackers had made it clear the duo were being punished for their activism and reporting. Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied city of Donetsk has cast doubt on holding elections in September, saying “First of all, the question is about the safety of our voters, we have no right to risk the lives of people.” At least three people were killed and 19 injured in a Russian drone attack on Monday on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy. A five-year-old boy was among the injured. An official building and two residential buildings were damaged in an attack carried out with four drones, the regional administration said on Telegram. Ukraine said on Monday its troops had regained more ground along eastern and southern fronts in what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described as progress in a “difficult” week for Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces. The US ambassador to Russia met with jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Moscow. Lynne Tracy met with Gershkovich on Monday after being granted access, her second visit since his detention in March. She has accused Russia of conducting “hostage diplomacy.” On Thursday, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, told reporters that the country has tried to get consular access to Gershkovich “virtually every day.” Zelenskiy and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called on Monday for the extension of the Black Sea Grain deal, which allows the safe export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports, an official said. After a call between the two leaders, Zelenskiy said he and Scholz focused on defence cooperation and on the forthcoming Nato summit in Lithuania, where Ukraine wants to secure an indication of future membership in the Alliance. Russia has brought 700,000 children from the conflict zones in Ukraine into Russian territory, Grigory Karasin, head of the international committee in the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of parliament, said late on Sunday, writing on his Telegram channel that the children had “found refuge” in Russia. Ukraine says many children have been illegally deported and the United States says thousands of children have been forcibly removed from their homes. An international office to investigate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine opened on Monday in The Hague, in the first step towards a possible tribunal for Moscow’s leadership. It will investigate and gather evidence in a move seen as an interim step before the creation of a special tribunal that could bring Kremlin officials to justice for starting the Ukraine war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-232-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T13:52:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 232 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-232-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-232-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 232 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. Germany chancellor Olaf Scholz said Thursday that the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians continue to be asked to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Russian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","fields":{"headline":"Russian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Seven sanctioned Russian companies, including a manufacturer of military helicopters deployed in the war in Ukraine, are visiting Saudi Arabia next week as part of a trade mission to increase business with the Gulf state. Companies including weapons manufacturers with direct links to the Russian military, state corporations involved in the invasion of Ukraine, and the agency overseeing a Ukrainian nuclear plant in the country seized by the Russian military last year, are set to attend. Saudi Arabia’s willingness to develop business ties with Russian companies sanctioned by western states for their role in the invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause further tensions in its already strained relationship with Washington. The Russian deputy industry and trade minister, Alexey Gruzdev, praised the trade event as the first of its kind. “Our business mission to Riyadh is aimed to strengthen the economic ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia, discover new business opportunities, exchange ideas and establish long-term partnership,” he said. Companies integral to the Russian military industrial sector are listed as attendees at the event in Riyadh on Monday. They include Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer of the Ka-52 Alligator helicopter. At least 35 Ka-52s have been shot down by Ukrainian forces or abandoned by Russia, according to the Dutch open-source outlet Oryx. Kamaz, an armoured vehicle manufacturer sanctioned for its role in aiding Russia’s war effort, is also listed as attending. Its trucks were spotted in Belarus in March 2022 carrying Iskander missiles that were allegedly launched in the early days of the invasion, and its Typhoon vehicles have also been reported transporting Russian soldiers across Ukrainian territory. Perhaps the most significant participant in the meetings with the Saudis is Rostec, a Russian state-owned defence systems and technology corporation that has supplied weapons used during the invasion of Ukraine. These included the Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower systems, the Zemledeliye remote mine-laying vehicles and various launch rocket systems. The US Treasury described Rostec as “the cornerstone of Russia’s defence, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors” in a sanctions notice published in June. Also listed as attending is Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company. According to Ukrainian officials and reports, Rosatom facilitated the Russian military’s seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last year, and has since taken over managing the facility. Rosatom denies the claims. A source familiar with the objectives of the Saudi trade event said Russian delegates were seeking to secure joint investment for business projects, assistance sustaining oil and gas prices and other diplomatic support. The source, who asked not to be named, said the Saudi investment ministry was exploring the possibility of opening an office in Moscow, and that a similar trade forum with Chinese businesses had also been held recently, although those businesses did not involve firms with connections to the Chinese military. “What is different here, and these recent business events are just one sign of it, is a major reorientation of Saudi policy towards Russia and China, and away from the USA and west Europe,” the source said. Saudi’s relationship with Moscow has created tensions in Washington. Last year, the kingdom sided with Russia over US interests when it decided to cut oil production shortly before the US midterm elections, prompting Joe Biden to threaten that the kingdom would face “consequences”. Asked about the planned Saudi-Russian trade meeting, a state department spokesperson said the US would continue to focus on “ensuring that our sanctions and export controls are properly enforced”. “We encourage countries and business to do their due diligence and refrain from conducting transactions with sanctioned persons, to avoid exposure to sanctions,” the spokesperson said. The US Treasury did not respond to a request for comment. The White House has backed off on its threats against Riyadh since last year. But anger towards the government of Mohammed bin Salman is still rife among Democrats and various Republicans on Capitol Hill, including some who have said they are concerned that Saudi Arabia could share sensitive US defence technology with its Russian allies. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman and longtime Saudi critic, said: “Saudi Arabia’s support for Russia in addition to its history of human rights violations should spark a serious review of the US-Saudi relationship.” Next week’s trade gathering could also frustrate the UK government, taking place shortly after a British trade mission aimed at securing an investment deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member. Seated next to the UK business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, at the Qatar Economic Forum this week, the Saudi investment minister, Khalid Al-Falih, declared Riyadh “the political capital of the Middle East”. Falih’s deputy is listed as a speaker of the Russian trade gathering next week. Saudi Arabia’s attempts to situate itself geopolitically as a partner to several leading powers – essentially playing all sides – was evident at a conference in California earlier this month, when Falih told business and political figures that Riyadh had no intention of being constrained by pre-existing relationships. He said: “We don’t feel that our relationship with the US is going to be at the expense of our ability to have relationships with other strong economic and political friends and partners around the world. This goes back to a multi-polar world where emerging middle powers … are going to be seeking their own interests.” Visibly irritated when asked about tensions between Washington and Riyadh, Falih observed that Saudi trade with China already exceeded that with the US and the EU combined. He said: “Do you expect us to put that at risk, just so that a certain country would feel that we’re on their side?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T07:27:22Z","webTitle":"Australia faces looming nuclear skills challenge to support Aukus submarines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","fields":{"headline":"Australia faces looming nuclear skills challenge to support Aukus submarines","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia will need to significantly scale up local nuclear education and training to build sufficient expertise for the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan, experts say. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry. Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales, said “we definitely have a healthy nuclear industry in Australia, but it’s often overlooked”, citing nuclear safeguards and research into nuclear materials, nuclear medicine and waste. “On the other hand … it needs to grow manyfold.” Prof Gregory Lane, who convenes the master of nuclear science program at the Australian National University, agrees. “There’s a lot of knowledge about nuclear science. It’s required in all sorts of different areas: mining, health, sterilisation of materials for general industry, industrial gauging.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup UNSW administers the only nuclear engineering degrees in the country, while the ANU is the only one to educate students in nuclear science. “The skills are available in Australia but there are specifics of [Aukus] that we’ve never had to deal with and they’re going to have to be developed over time,” Lane said, adding: “Fundamentally, we don’t have a nuclear power program in Australia.” The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto), a government agency, runs a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lane describes the Ansto reactor as “one of the most technologically advanced reactors of its type”, which produces neutrons for experiments and to make medical isotopes. “But that’s a very different beast to a reactor that is used for power and then a reactor that you’re going put under water and needs to be absolutely failsafe.” Burr and Lane agree that some nuclear personnel will need to be trained overseas. V Adm Jonathan Mead confirmed last week that some Royal Australian Navy officers were completing a nuclear reactor course in the US and also enrolled in UNSW and ANU programs. Burr said UNSW had about 125 graduates each year across its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, while Lane said more than 20 students were currently enrolled in the ANU master’s program. For the nuclear-powered submarines, “suitably qualified and experienced personnel” will be required at three tiers of expertise, Burr said. The first tier are those who are “nuclear aware”, which would require only several months of training, Burr said. “In a nuclear submarine … even something as simple as welding a pipe needs to be done by a nuclear-aware welder” – someone with additional training about the implications of working with nuclear-grade materials. “If the weld goes wrong while you’re at sea, it could be catastrophic.” The second tier are people who “have somewhere between five and 10 years of experience, and they typically have an education in engineering as well”. The third tier, requiring the most expertise, are those with 20 to 30 years’ experience and a PhD at a minimum. UNSW modelling, led by Dr Edward Obbard, forecasts that operating and maintaining eight nuclear-propelled submarines would directly require several thousand tier 1 personnel, about 2,500 people at tier 2 and about 200 tier 3 subject matter experts. Experts say scaling up local nuclear capabilities will require national coordination. “This needs to be a coordinated, collaborative effort from all nuclear training and education institutions in Australia,” Burr said. “Ansto will have a crucial role to play, not in education, but in some level of training and some level of government advisory.” Lane said: “We need to be looking at regulation, law, engineering, strategic studies, health – all of these things matter in supporting a nuclear submarine effort.” Ansto declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T15:42:33Z","webTitle":"Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","fields":{"headline":"Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germany plans to ban the installation of most oil and gas heating systems from next year, with proposals approved on Wednesday triggering angry divisions in the cabinet. The radical plans are designed to transform Germany’s heating systems in an attempt to meet net zero emission targets that critics have called unworkable and discriminatory. About half of Germany’s 41m households currently use natural gas heating, and almost a quarter use heating oil. Championed by the economics minister, Robert Habeck of the Greens, the bill is due to come to parliament in June. But the pro-business FDP has lashed out, calling it the equivalent of an “atomic bomb” for Germany and expressing concerns about its effect on the economy, the burden it will put on poorer households and the technical practicalities of implementing it. The FDP’s leader, Christian Lindner, who is also the finance minister, indicated in a protocol note sent to his cabinet colleagues that he was prepared to support the bill only if changes were made. He said he feared the budget needed to carry out the task would in effect blow up Germany’s tight debt control mechanisms. The party’s general secretary, Bijan Djir-Sarai, said the proposal was not practical and would have to be changed. The opposition CDU, which has said it would oppose the bill, has called it a “crowbar reform”, and Jens Spahn, the vice-parliamentary group leader, said his party would “do everything possible to ensure this law doesn’t happen in this form”. Environmentalists have largely welcomed the proposal, with Greenpeace calling it a long overdue milestone. Many experts have said it does not go far enough. Habeck said it was a necessary part of Germany’s ambition to become carbon neutral by 2045, and he said the country was lagging behind. “Comparative to other countries who’ve done this earlier, we’re starting late with this,” he said, referring to Nordic countries, which are far less reliant on fossil fuels to heat their homes. He hit back at the criticism from the FDP, saying that “gazing in astonishment at a problem does not make things better”. If the bill is passed in June, it will enact a virtual ban on the installation of gas and oil heating from 2024. It will require almost all newly installed heating systems to run on 65% renewable energy in new as well as old buildings, in which defunct models would need to be replaced. Homeowners will be encouraged to install heat pumps to run on renewable sources of electricity, or to switch to district heating, electric or solar thermal systems. Biomass heat, hydrogen and gas obtained from an approved environmentally friendly source, such as biomethane, will all be encouraged under a programme of subsidy payments of 10-40% for each heating system,. In addition, “Klimabonis” or additional climate bonus payments, will be available in certain cases, for instance if someone voluntarily switches to a more climate-friendly system, regardless of their income. The challenge will be to make these energy sources more readily available. Other questions relate to a shortage of heating engineers – industry estimates a shortfall of 60,000 workers – supply chain problems and lack of technological development. Heat pumps are still thought unsuitable for many older types of houses, for which they require large amounts of electricity to be effective, even as the bigger heating sector providers are working feverishly to improve the systems. Homeowners over the age of 80 will be exempted from having to switch to new systems, as will those who receive social welfare benefits. Germany’s Association of Local Utilities (VKU), which governs municipal infrastructure, urged the government to extend the transition periods, calling the proposed law an “emotional rollercoaster”. A poll by the Forsa Institute showed 78% of Germans were against the plans and 62% expected heating bills to increase as a result of the move to renewables. The scheme is initially expected to cost German taxpayers about €9.16bn a year until 2028, decreasing to €5bn from 2029 as renewable energy expansion and a reduction in the cost of heat pumps because of mass production help to offset costs. It is to be financed from the €180bn Climate and Transformation Fund, into which the money raised from a CO2 emission levy on fossil fuels is paid. A large segment of this fund is already dedicated to building insulation projects to make them more energy efficient, prompting concerns that finances may be tight. Fines of €5,000-€50,000 can be imposed on people failing to abide by the law. The discussion about phasing out gas heating in Germany was the preserve of environment experts until Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which halted gas and oil supplies from Russia and turbo-charged the decision to switch from fossil fuel imports. Last week, Germany turned off the last of its three working nuclear power plants, after decades of discussion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T17:55:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian troops accused of shelling civilians during flood evacuations – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian troops accused of shelling civilians during flood evacuations – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the stories today. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas”. Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv of “blatant lies” at the UN’s top court. One of Russia’s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners Oleg Orlov went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia’s armed forces, his organisation said. A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia’s online information shutdown, the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer reports. The past few days have brought a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive, the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation, the Guardian’s Julian Borger reports. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine’s prosecutor general claimed. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is “actively on the defensive” in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. The investigations team of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu’s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine, the Guardian’s Shaun Walker reported. Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the “unfolding tragedy” in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a “terrorist plot” in a statement. Britain announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross, who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning.

Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv instead of “blatant lies” at the UN’s top court. Ukraine has asked The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Russia to halt alleged discrimination against the Tatar ethnic group in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula occupied by Russia since 2014. At the second day of hearings at the ICJ, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, Alexander Shulgin, said: Ukraine is constantly turning to blatant lies and false accusations leveled against the Russian federation. In the same case, Kyiv also says that Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in 2014. On the first day of the hearing, Ukraine accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea. Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. The court adjourned on Thursday but will hold two more days of hearings next week where Ukraine and Russia can react to each other’s submissions. The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year. Here is a round-up of images from the wires of Ukrainian’s recusing animals from flooding in the Kherson region after the Nova Kakhovka dam was breached. One of Russia’s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia’s armed forces, his organisation said. Oleg Orlov has since 1999 been one of the leaders of Memorial, which won a share of the Nobel Peace prize in 2022 a year after being banned and dissolved in Russia. Since sending its tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has intensified a long-running clampdown on all forms of political dissent and made it an offence to discredit the armed forces or deviate from government accounts of what it calls a “special military operation”, Reuters reports. Orlov, who came to prominence by opposing Soviet totalitarianism, told the independent Moscow Times last month that campaigners like him were to some extent following the path of anti-communist dissidents of the cold war era. The charges are based on an article he wrote denouncing Russia for waging the conflict. He told the court, according to a Memorial post on Telegram: In my article I spoke about the terrible role that war plays for the development of the political regime in our country. “This is an opinion, reasoning, an evaluation,” he said, adding that he could not understand how he could be punished for expressing an opinion. Orlov’s defence team included Dmitry Muratov, editor of the now-banned independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and also a winner of the Nobel Peace prize, for his decades of work to defend freedom of speech in Russia. Outside the court, Muratov told reporters: Article 29 of the constitution directly says that censorship is prohibited, everyone has the right to disseminate information, and no one has the right to force anyone to give up their beliefs. Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Russia director, said the state could not tolerate Orlov’s “need to defend the truth and his refusal to remain silent”. “The price he and others pay for exercising their right to freedom of expression in today’s Russia is very high indeed,” she said. A senior Russian commander briefed President Vladimir Putin today on how his forces had repelled a large-scale Ukrainian attack in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the Tass news agency reported. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier on Thursday that Russian forces had withstood fierce overnight attempts by Ukrainian troops to break through the frontline in Zaporizhzhia and had inflicted heavy losses on them, according to Reuters. The Russian defence ministry on Thursday evening released a video clip of an interview in which a commander called Col Gen Alexander Romanchuk was seen explaining how Russian forces had held off the Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia. A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia’s online information shutdown. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has blocked or closed down nearly all independent media outlets. The Kremlin has also blocked major western social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. In part, the letter said: The Russian authorities are preparing for Vladimir Putin’s re-election in 2024. No other discourse than official propaganda will be tolerated. We have strong suspicions that YouTube and Telegram could be totally blocked in Russia no later than this autumn. After that, more than 140 million people would be hostages of the state propaganda narrative. Only two major platforms have partially survived this purge for now. Telegram and YouTube are the only spaces left for Russian journalists to try to inform their fellow citizens about the reality of the war waged in their name by Vladimir Putin. The joint statement continued “We do not want to live in a new cold war era. There is an urgent need to reconnect Russian citizens with pluralistic information, and with the rest of the world.” “It is the essence of the internet to provide this function,” continues the statement addressed to the heads of global tech giants including the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, the Twitter CEO, Elon Musk, and the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, saying: “What we need now is to establish a communication channel between representatives of the platforms and us, to build together solutions to reconnect Russian citizens with their independent press in exile.” It added: “Russian citizens will find themselves locked in the dark alone with their president” if free information on the internet is not supported. The past few days have seen a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive. Nasa’s satellite monitoring of fires in that area of the frontline confirms what Russian bloggers have been saying: that the area around Tokmak and Orihiv first under very heavy preparatory shelling followed by a Ukrainian attempt to break through Russian defences towards Tokmak. This area of the front has long been seen as a likely axis for a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol, not least because Tokmak itself is a major railway junction and Russian logistical hub that has key lines of communication with both Mauripol and Berdiansk. Russia has long feared a Ukrainian advance here building multi-layered defences including zigzag trenches, dragon’s teeth, minefields and other obstacles also reinforcing the area with both troops and medical personnel. On Telegram, the Russian military blogger channel War Gonzo said it remained “too early to say” that the Ukrainian offensive had become bogged down, describing a “hard night” for Russian forces around Orihiv. It added: It is reported from the scene that in the direction of Orehiv-Tokmak the enemy infantry continues to approach and try to gain a foothold. Enemy artillery and tanks are still intensively working on our positions. Our troops hold the line and do not allow a breakthrough of the front, destroying enemy manpower and equipment. According to information from the field, our fighters managed to knock out a tank similar to the Leopard, but it is still impossible to identify the destroyed equipment for certain. Other Russian online sources spoke of an assault with armour and infantry with the village of Robotyne being a focus of Ukrainian assaults in the past 24 hours with both Ukrainian and Russian aviation active in the sector. On Thursday there were also reports that the Russian occupation administration had ordered evacuations from settlements around Tokmak. It remains unclear, however, whether the fighting in the Tokmak area represents Ukraine’s main effort. While it appears to be more substantial than a reconnaissance in force, it is possible that the push in recent days could be a so called “demonstration” designed to persuade Moscow that the main advance will be in the direction of Melitopol. Ukraine’s general staff will also be using the current assault to gather active intelligence on the quality of Russia’s defensive positions as it moves forward. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dike around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse in the dike around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst case scenario and there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns over the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro river and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds used to cool the reactor cores. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said: It is vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou told the Guardian. The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said today that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough “to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation” but he warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined - both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. “We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant’s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.” The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh has tweeted from the village of Bilozerka, west of Kherson, where two dozen houses were underwater. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the bursting of the Soviet-era Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which sent waters cascading across the war zone of southern Ukraine in the early hours of Tuesday, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. Reuters reports: “The impact of the region’s water supply sanitation systems and public health services cannot be underestimated,” the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press briefing. “The WHO has rushed in to support the authorities and health care workers in preventive measures against waterborne diseases and to improve disease surveillance.” Asked specifically about cholera, WHO technical officer Teresa Zakaria said that the risk of an outbreak was present since the pathogen exists in the environment. She said that the WHO was working with Ukraine’s health ministry to put mechanisms in place to ensure that vaccines can be imported if needed. “We are trying to address quite a wide range of health risks actually associated with the floods, starting from trauma to drowning, to waterborne diseases but also all the way to the potential implications of disruption to chronic treatment,” she added. The huge Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River separates Russian and Ukrainian forces and people have been affected on both sides of its banks. WHO’s emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said the WHO has offered assistance to Russian-controlled areas but that its operational presence was “primarily” on the Ukrainian side. He said Russian authorities had given them assurances that people living in areas it occupies were being “well monitored, well cared for, well fed [and] well supported”. “We will be delighted to be able to access those areas and be able to monitor health as we would in most situations wish to do,” he said, adding it would be for the Ukrainian and Russian authorities to agree how that could be achieved. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. “Without a source of water supply, it is impossible to grow vegetables. Grain and oilseeds will be grown using an extensive model with low yields,” the ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports. The ministry said the dam’s destruction would flood tens of thousands of hectares of agricultural land in southern Ukraine and could turn at least 500,000 hectares of land left without irrigation into “deserts”. The ministry said the flooded land would require a full agro-ecological assessment of the soil condition and in most cases special soil restoration methods would need to be applied. It said vegetables, melons, grains and oilseeds were the main products which were grown on the affected land. Ukraine is a major global grain and oilseeds grower and exporter. The destruction of the dam on Tuesday, which Ukraine and Russia blame on each other, has also made it impossible to navigate parts of the Dnipro River and deprived Kyiv of an important agricultural export route, shipping authorities said. The agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, also said the farm sector’s losses could be much higher than previously expected because the disaster inflicted “years” of damage on irrigation. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine‘s prosecutor general claimed. The prosecutor general’s office said two other people were wounded in the incident and that four were hurt in a separate location, and that a war crimes investigation had been opened. “Due to targeted strikes by the occupiers during evacuation measures in the city, a civilian died,” it said in a statement, Reuters reports. The interior ministry said eight people had been wounded during Russian strikes on Kherson but mentioned no deaths. The ministry said the Russian shelling had begun “precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded”. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is “actively on the defensive” in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. In an update on Telegram she said: In the east, our troops are active in the Bakhmut direction. Fighting continues. In some places, the enemy tries to go on the offensive, but without success … in the Zaporizhzhia direction in the Orikhiv area, the enemy is actively on the defensive. Russian military bloggers on Telegram today have been posting about activity in the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu is quoted by Tass as saying an attack has been repulsed. [See 13.59 BST] Tass quotes him saying: Today at 1.30am in the Zaporizhzhia direction, the enemy attempted to break through our defences with the forces of the 47th mechanised brigade, numbering up to 1,500 people and 150 armoured vehicles. The Tass report goes on to say that Shoigu claimed “as a result of a two-hour battle, the armed forces of Ukraine lost 30 tanks, 11 infantry fighting vehicles, and up to 350 personnel. Thus, the enemy’s specially trained reserve forces for the implementation of this breakthrough did not fulfil their task.” Speaking of the Russian defence minister, our central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker has this report: The investigations team of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu’s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine. Previously, Shoigu was known to have two daughters, but Navalny’s team say the defence minister had a secret second family in the early 2000s, and obtained documents it claimed showed his mistress had received a vast, lavish property despite a modest official salary. Navalny’s team claimed 22-year-old Danila Shebunov was one of three children from Shoigu’s second, secret, relationship, and said he also owned prime real estate in central Moscow. These properties allegedly bring Shebunov a sizeable income from rent, and were allegedly obtained thanks to his father’s connections. Shebunov, who goes by the name Sheba Singer, has a rich social media presence, although few followers, and recently has produced a steady output of pop songs and lifestyle videos, usually in English and often involving him undressing. Maria Pevchikh of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, who presented the video investigation, asked ironically why it was that Shebunov was producing this kind of output rather than suffering in a trench in Ukraine along with thousands of Russian soldiers his age. For years, Navalny’s team has made videos it says expose corruption and hypocrisy in Putin’s elite. The latest video, 19 minutes long, had clocked up more than 100,000 views on YouTube within an hour of being posted. Neither Shoigu nor Shebunov have yet commented on the video. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. Shoigu was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that four separate Ukrainian attacks along the front had been halted and that Kyiv’s forces had been forced to retreat “with heavy losses”. These claims have not been independently verified. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. Ukraine’s interior ministry said in a statement: The shelling began precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded. It reiterated accusations that Russia had abandoned people in territory it occupied in the Kherson region, adding: And it continues to prevent Ukraine from saving the most valuable – human lives. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the “unfolding tragedy” in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a “terrorist plot”. In a statement, permanent representative Vassily Nebenzia at the UN security council (UNSC) briefing on the situation around the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant said: On the night of 5 June to 6 [June], the Kyiv regime committed an unthinkable crime. They blasted the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which resulted in an uncontrolled release of water downstream of the Dnipro River. Feeling its total impunity and being encouraged by western sponsors, the Kyiv regime decided to fulfil this terrorist plot this time. The responsibility for this unfolding tragedy fully rests with the Kyiv regime and its western masters who pump up Ukraine with weapons. The water level at a reservoir in southern Ukraine is approaching a dangerous low after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the state company overseeing the facility said on Thursday, which could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow and Kyiv blamed one another for the collapse of the dam on Tuesday, which unleashed water from the Dnipro River into a wide area of the Kherson region, Reuters reports. Ihor Syrota, general director of the energy company Ukrhydroenergo, told Ukrainian television that a drop below the current water level at the Kakhovka reservoir could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and water supply to other regions. He said: We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 (meters), after which there will be not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station … or. … for all regions.” Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said on Thursday the situation was “stable and under control” at the Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday morning. Syrota added that Ukrhydroenergo was ready to work on an overlay across the damaged hydroelectric station and dam as soon as Russian forces left the eastern side of the Dnipro, and that it would take about two months to complete. Britain has announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. Belarus, led by president Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, is Russia’s staunchest ally among ex-Soviet states and allowed its territory to be used to launch the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Last month Russia moved ahead with a decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement: This new package ratchets up the economic pressure on Lukashenko and his regime which actively facilitates the Russian war effort and ignores Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The new package includes banning the import of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus from Britain of banknotes and machinery, as well as goods, technologies and materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Britain said it would also be able to prevent designated Belarusian media companies from “spreading propaganda in the UK” with social media companies and internet service providers restricting access to the websites of sanctioned Belarusian media organisations. Flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine has forced Russian troops to retreat by distances of five to 15km (three to nine miles) in the Kherson region, a military spokesperson said. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, told Ukrainian television the redeployment had “practically halved” Russian shelling in the region, Reuters reports. Russia has not yet commented. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region said in a statement posted on Telegram that two settlements in the region had been attacked by drones. Belgorod, which borders Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, has come under repeated attack from Kyiv’s forces in recent weeks. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come … The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the staff at one of Kherson’s hospitals for their work in helping people affected by the explosion at the Nova Kakhovka dam during a visit. In a tweet, he described medics as “heroic people” and wished patients good health. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, did not currently have any plans to visit the disaster area. Here are some more images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visiting people at a hospital that is being used as one of Kherson’s evacuation points. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas”. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there was a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital, saying that the city’s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. The US president, Joe Biden, is to welcome the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “top of mind”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mabel Banfield-Nwachi will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian Industry and Trade minister Denis Manturov said on Thursday that Moscow has no access to the damaged part of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, and does not expect to be granted it, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia has made the restart of the pipeline, which before the war carried ammonia from Russia to Ukraine for export, central to future renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to export its grain safely from its Black Sea ports. Reuters reports that both Russia and Ukraine this week claimed there was damage to a section of the pipeline that runs through the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The two sides have blamed each other. The water level in the North Crimean Canal, which carries water from the Kakhovka reservoir behind the breached Kakhovka dam to the Crimean peninsula, remains stable, Reuters reports the Russian-imposed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Thursday. Crimea relies heavily on water transported by the canal. After Moscow seized the peninsula in 2014, claiming to have annexed it, Kyiv blocked the canal. Mines uprooted and dispersed by flood waters surging downstream from the breached Kakhovka dam across swathes of southern Ukraine could pose a grave danger to civilians for decades to come, the Red Cross said. “In the past we knew where the hazards were. Now we don’t know. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,” said Erik Tollefsen, head of the Weapon Contamination Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross. “It is with a certain horror that we look at the news coming out,” Reuters reports Tollefsen said in an audio clip, adding that the second world war mines found underwater in Denmark in 2015 were still active. Besides anti-personnel mines, both sides have used vast amounts of artillery shells and anti-tank mines. The exact number of mines in Ukraine is unclear, said Tollefsen. “We just know the numbers are massive,” said Tollefsen. Tollefsen said the issue with mines was not necessarily the nominal number of mines but where they were laid – especially in a heavily agricultural country such as Ukraine. Here are some of the first images to be released of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kherson. They show Ukraine’s president touring the flooded area and speaking to Ihor Klymenko, the head of the national police. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reports that there is a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River. He has posted to Telegram: In connection with the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam, there was an uncontrolled flow of water from the Dnipro River downstream. There is a rise in the water level in the Inhulets River, which flows into the Dnipro. Listing several villages near Kalynivske, which is about 22 miles (35km) from the Dnipro, Litvinov warned: “Due to the flooding of the bridge, it is not possible to travel to the village of Zapovit. The water is getting close to the homes of residents.” Here are some images that have been sent to us over the news wires from occupied Ukraine, showing the impact of flooding in Nova Kakhovka, where the local Russian-imposed official has said five people have died. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has posted to Twitter video footage released by Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office of his meeting in Kherson. If you wanted something to listen to, today our Today in Focus podcast features my colleague Dan Sabbagh on the ground in Kherson talking about the aftermath of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. You can listen to it here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Three people are known to have died on the Ukraine-controlled bank of the Dnipro River, while occupying authorities on the left-bank have said at least five people were killed. Ukraine’s regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, has said about 230 sq miles (600 sq km) of the region is under water, and that Ukraine has so far evacuated almost 2,000 people. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president wrote: Working trip to Kherson region. A coordination meeting on the liquidation of consequences of the Kakhovka HPP dam explosion. Many important issues were discussed. The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organization of life support for the flooded areas. Also, the prospects for restoring the region’s ecosystem and the operational military situation in the man-made disaster area. It is important to calculate the damage and allocate funds to compensate residents affected by the disaster and develop a programme to compensate for losses or relocate businesses within the Kherson region. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, Tass reports, citing the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital. He has been under pressure after people were killed when they were unable to get into a shelter. On Telegram, Klitschko wrote: Today, the Kyiv city council has to adopt a comprehensive draft decision concerning shelters. In particular, to warn the owners of private premises that if they are not properly maintained or people are not admitted during the air raid, these premises may be seized from them. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was under water on Thursday after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. “We’re already working. We will help everyone that has ended up in trouble,” Reuters reports he said in a video statement of the flooding, caused by the collapse of the dam. “Despite the immense danger and constant Russian shelling, evacuation from zones of flooding is continuing,” Prokudin said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Russian media reports that almost 4,300 people have been evacuated in the occupied area of Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, citing the regional authority head of Kherson, reports that as of this morning “almost 2,000 people have been evacuated from the flooded zone” in the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro River. The left bank of the Dnipro and southern portion of Kherson is occupied by Russia. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The occupied city is the largest in the Luhansk region, one of four Ukrainian regions the Russian Federation claimed to have annexed in late 2022. More details soon … South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said on Thursday. Putin expressed his desire to receive the peace mission, Reuters reports the presidency statement said. Maxar has supplied these satellite images of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The first was taken on 5 June. The second shows the condition of the dam yesterday, on 7 June. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass, citing emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Ukraine’s Kherson region, has said up to 14,000 homes have been flooded and nearly 4,300 people evacuated. In a status update on Telegram, Tass reported: Over 14,000 houses were flooded after the breakthrough of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated, emergency services report. Twenty-three people were seen by doctors of which 21 were hospitalised, medical services reported. Our First Edition morning newsletter today features my colleague Esther Addley talking to our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh, who is in Kherson. Here is an extract: “This is a huge crisis,” said Dan Sabbagh, adding that there is “something elemental” about the scale of the flooding. “It’s just a massive river. We don’t know where the river boundary will end up. We don’t know what the new landscape will look like.” The water was still rising, though more slowly than before, when Dan spoke to me yesterday from central Kherson. He was standing at a crossroads that ordinarily would be hundreds of metres from the riverbank; instead, he said, the kerb had become “quite a busy little port” as rescue boats came and went. For eight months last year, Kherson was occupied by Russian forces; parts of it have been heavily damaged by shelling and many people had already left the city by the time the floods hit. “Younger people tend to get out as fast as they can,” said Dan. “The residents who have stayed on are mostly older, and have point blank refused to go.” For many of those who remained, though, the flooding has forced them out of the homes they resolutely refused to quit. As we spoke, Dan described an inflatable dinghy arriving, carrying a woman in her 70s and an older man who was unable to walk, who had been rescued along with “the obligatory dog”. A basket of five brown cats had been brought in a little earlier; in the background a dog was barking. “There are a lot of abandoned pets – you see them everywhere. It’s just a feature of a war zone.” Read more here: Thursday briefing – The Kherson dam disaster has left thousands of Ukrainians adrift, and that’s just the start You can sign up for our free daily newsletter First Edition. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has this morning insisted that, in the wake of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the war is not regarded as a conflict between neighbours. She tweeted: There is no equivalence in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It’s not a “conflict” between neighbours. It is an illegal invasion by Russia. Whose efforts have gone beyond stealing Ukrainian land to destroying it and the Ukrainian people who live peacefully on it. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The Associated Press reports that Sunak is also looking to make the case to Biden for UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace to succeed outgoing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to end his term leading the 31-member alliance in September. Stoltenberg is slated to meet with Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are set to gather in Lithuania on 11-12 July for their annual summit. President Joe Biden is welcoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind”, the Associated Press reports. The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. “The two leaders will review a range of global issues including our economic partnership or shared support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s war of aggression, as well as further action to accelerate the clean energy transition,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president and the prime minister will also discuss the joint US-UK leadership on critical emerging technologies as well as our work to strengthen our economic security.” In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. That update from the International Atomic Energy explains that while all six of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plan’t reactors are “in shutdown mode” cooling water is still needed “to prevent fuel melt and a possible release of radioactive material”. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. “In view of the IAEA’s intensifying activities under the newly established principles, he will also strengthen the IAEA’s presence at the site, replacing the current team with a larger group travelling with him across the frontline,” the IAEA announced in an update on Wednesday. It quoted Director General Grossi as saying, “The possible loss of the plant’s main source of cooling water further complicates an already extremely difficult and challenging nuclear safety and security situation”. The update outlines threats to the water supply for ponds that feed cool the plant’s nuclear reactors. The agency said that it was working to ensure that there was as much cooling water in reserve as possible in the event that it could no longer access the Kakhovka reservoir. The reservoir’s water levels were continuing to drop, the agency said. It explained that the reservoir’s water levels had already fallen by 2.8 metres since Tuesday, but that the hourly rate of loss had slowed to “ between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour from a peak of around 11 cm/hour yesterday”. “If the level falls below 12.7 metres, the ZNPP will no longer be able to pump water from the reservoir to the site.” it said, adding that this level could be reached in two days. “Preparing for such a possibility, the ZNPP is continuously replenishing its water reserves – including the large cooling pond next to the plant as well as its smaller sprinkler cooling ponds and the adjacent channels – by fully utilising the water of the Kakhovka reservoir while this still remains possible.” Three people have died as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, local media have reported, in what would be the first confirmed deaths, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced fears for the lives of Ukrainians in Russian-held areas hit by the disaster. Citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky, Yevhen Ryshchuk, the Kyiv Independent reported that “three people drowned” in the Kherson region. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. At least three people have been confirmed dead as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday, citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky in Kherson region. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address that it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied areas due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. “The situation in occupied parts of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers are simply abandoning people in frightful conditions. No help, without water, left on the roofs of houses in submerged communities,” he said. “If an international organisation is not present in the disaster zone, it means it does not exist at all or is incapable.” Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have been left “without normal access to drinking water” after the destruction, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned. The Ukrainian leader said the evacuation of people and the urgent provision of drinking water were top priorities. The World Bank will support Ukraine by conducting a rapid assessment of damages and needs, a top bank official said on Wednesday. Anna Bjerde, the World Bank’s managing director for operations, said the destruction of the Novo Kakhovka dam had “many very serious consequences for essential service delivery and the broader environment.” Drone footage showed roads and buildings in Kherson completely submerged by flood water. The critical dam, which lies along the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s Kherson region – now held by Russia – collapsed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told Putin in a phone call on Wednesday that a comprehensive investigation was needed into the destruction of the dam. Erdoğan told Putin that an international commission that includes the UN and Turkey could be formed to look into the issue, a statement from the Turkish president’s office said. Britain cannot yet say Russia is responsible for the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, prime minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday. Asked during a visit to the US whether Russia was responsible, Sunak said: “I can’t say that definitively yet” but that “if true it will represent a new low. It’s an appalling act of barbarism on Russia’s part.” The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible for the destruction of the dam, national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, he told reporters at the White House, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. France will send aid to Ukraine “to meet immediate needs” after the destruction of the dam, President Emmanuel Macron has said. Macron said he expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the aftermath of what he described as an “atrocious act which is endangering populations”. A top Moscow-backed official in a part of Ukraine controlled by Russia has said that the collapse of the dam has handed the Russian military a tactical advantage. Vladimir Saldo said he believed Kyiv was to blame for the disaster but that the dam’s destruction and resulting flood waters would make it easier for Russia to defend against any Ukrainian counter-offensive in the area. Relief workers on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the river have reported having to work under fire. The UN’s humanitarian aid agency warned the disaster “will likely get worse in the coming hours”, with access to drinking water and health risks associated with contaminated water among the most pressing concerns. Ukraine has not yet launched a planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia, a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, dismissed statements by Russian officials who have said the counteroffensive has already begun, adding that its start will be obvious to everyone when it happens. Russia’s defence ministry has said “Ukrainian saboteurs” had blown up a section of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline on Monday, which carries fertiliser from Russia to Ukraine in Kharkiv region. There was no immediate comment on the allegations from Ukraine. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T15:31:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 439 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 439 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement added. At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-03T00:38:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 192 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 192 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Russian energy company Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing turbine damage. Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, indicated that Siemens could not carry out repairs because of sanctions. The European Commission chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said Gazprom was staging the shutdown “under fallacious pretences”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said six of the team’s experts remained at the site to continue the work. He told reporters the mission would produce a report early next week of its findings. Grossi said military operations were increasing in the region of the plant, “which worries me a lot”. He said the military presence was not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit to the Russian-controlled facility in south-eastern Ukraine . Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin said imposing the price cap would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders went ahead it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” would likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been “violated several times”, Rafael Grossi said. The IAEA chief said after leading the inspection team that while he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion. “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country,” Pushilin said. “This is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russian-attack-on-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shows-recklessness-and-dangers-of-putins-war-australia-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T05:05:05Z","webTitle":"Russian attack on Ukraine nuclear plant shows ‘recklessness and dangers of Putin’s war’, Australia says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-attack-on-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shows-recklessness-and-dangers-of-putins-war-australia-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-attack-on-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shows-recklessness-and-dangers-of-putins-war-australia-says","fields":{"headline":"Russian attack on Ukraine nuclear plant shows ‘recklessness and dangers of Putin’s war’, Australia says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s foreign minister has condemned the shelling of a large nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it shows “the recklessness and dangers” of Vladimir Putin’s war. The Ukrainian government reported earlier on Friday that the Russian army was “firing from all sides” upon the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest of its kind in Europe – and a fire had broken out. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “The world condemns that behaviour and Australia strongly so.” Authorities at the plant have since said the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” but the incident attracted the concern of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. Payne told the ABC: “That just seems to me to absolutely reinforce the complete breach of any aspect of international law, and all aspects of international law, that apply here, of the UN charter, and to reinforce the unlawful behaviour that President Putin is engaged in.” The minister also argued Australian sanctions were starting to have an effect, with $45m belonging to a designated Russian entity currently being “frozen in an Australian financial institution”, although she did not go into details. Payne said the coordination of sanctions among Australia, Europe, the UK, the US, Japan and South Korea was “a very important indicator of that strength of unity globally in opposition to Russia’s appalling actions”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he did not believe Putin would be “dissuaded from his murderous acts” in Ukraine, but that should not stop the rest of the world from “tightening the vice” on the Russian leader. Morrison raised “deep concerns” about the close alignment between China and Russia. He told radio station 6PR it was important to send a “very clear message to anyone else, any other autocratic regime, and we know about a few of those in our own region … [to] not take the wrong lesson out of this”. Morrison acknowledged there were differences between Taiwan – the democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its breakaway province – and Ukraine. But he also called for greater preparedness for potential instability in the Indo-Pacific region, after joining an urgently convened virtual meeting with his counterparts from Japan, India and the US – known as the Quad – early Friday morning. The Quad meeting discussed the crisis in Ukraine and “assessed its broader implications” – but the joint statement issued by the four leaders did not include any direct criticism of Russia, and said countries in the Indo-Pacific must be “free from military, economic, and political coercion”. India is particularly keen to keep the Quad focused on the Indo-Pacific, and it has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Morrison played down the lack of unity with India on the response to Ukraine, saying he “wouldn’t put them in the same category as China, not even remotely”. The prime minister noted India was calling for an end to the violence, and said Australia needed to “work patiently with our partners”. The New York Times reported this week that senior Chinese officials had told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The paper cited Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report. China’s foreign ministry vehemently denied the report, denouncing it as “fake news” designed to “divert attention and shift blame, which is utterly despicable”. The foreign ministry also blamed Nato’s eastward expansion and the US administration’s attitude towards Ukraine’s Nato membership for the deterioration of relations with Russia. Payne told 4BC radio it was “ultimately for China” to respond to the reports, but added: “Any collaboration on this illegal, unjustified and unprovoked Russian invasion would be deeply concerning.” The Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said China had a “particular responsibility” to use its close relationship with Russia to press for an end to the aggression. While the Australian government has rapidly expanded sanctions against Russian political and business figures since last week’s invasion of Ukraine, it has also quietly updated regulations allowing it to target Myanmar’s military junta. The changes take effect on Saturday, more than a year after the coup in Myanmar, and are intended to expand the “toolkit” available to the government. The expanded criteria will allow the government to impose sanctions on current or former members of a range of junta-linked bodies. They include Myanmar’s State Administration Council, which is chaired by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. The new regulations are a preparatory step that will make it easier to introduce sanctions against junta figures, but it would still require Payne to make further decisions naming individuals. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, welcomed the creation of a “clear pathway to sanction individuals and entities connected to the junta” and urged the Australian government to act “without delay”. “It has a lot of catching up to do with like-minded governments following the coup one year ago,” Pearson said. The Australian government has never ruled out expanding sanctions on Myanmar’s military figures, but it has sought to remain in close coordination with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Leaders in the region have become increasingly frustrated about a lack of progress in implementing Asean’s “five-point consensus” to resolve the crisis in Myanmar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/dec/17/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-energy-supply-taskforce","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-17T16:55:16Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak scraps energy supply taskforce set up by Liz Truss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/17/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-energy-supply-taskforce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/dec/17/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-energy-supply-taskforce","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak scraps energy supply taskforce set up by Liz Truss","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An energy security taskforce launched by Liz Truss has been scrapped by her successor, Rishi Sunak, after three months. The taskforce, announced by Truss towards the beginning of her brief tenure as prime minister, was created as part of a package of measures announced in September to reform the “broken” market. Led by Madelaine McTernan, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s vaccine taskforce, the team aimed to agree long-term contracts with domestic and international suppliers to improve Britain’s energy security and cut charges. However, although Truss said the energy supply taskforce had already started negotiations in September, a government source has confirmed it was subsequently scrapped by Sunak. They said: “Winding down the taskforce is the right decision. While it was sensible in September for the previous administration to explore these contracts, locking in long-term contracts while gas prices are this high just doesn’t make sense.” Saying the taskforce was “one option on the table”, the source pointed to a “whole range of other actions” being taken in service of its aims, including financial backing for the new Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk. Truss said at the time that the consequences of Russia’s assault on Ukraine had exposed the “flaws” in the UK’s approach to energy security, and declared her intent to end “short-term thinking” on the issue “once and for all”. Other measures, announced as part of the energy bailout in September, included the “energy price guarantee”, which froze bills for an average household at £2,500 a year from 1 October. This will continue to protect bill-payers until the end of March 2024, despite the regulator Ofgem confirming last month that the annual price cap is due to rise to £4,279 in January 2023. A six-month scheme offering “equivalent support” for businesses and other non-domestic energy users was also announced at the time, with continuing assistance for “vulnerable industries” provided after the end of that period. A government spokesperson said: “The energy supply taskforce was set up in September 2022 as part of efforts to boost domestic energy security. “While the government is continuing these efforts and remains completely committed to strengthening our energy resilience, we have concluded that direct purchases of gas are not the best intervention in the market.” The Truss administration had said the taskforce and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would also negotiate with renewable energy producers in an effort to cut their prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/29/thames-water-could-delay-accounts-as-turmoil-in-water-industry-grows","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-29T18:26:39Z","webTitle":"Thames Water could delay accounts as turmoil in water industry grows ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/29/thames-water-could-delay-accounts-as-turmoil-in-water-industry-grows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/29/thames-water-could-delay-accounts-as-turmoil-in-water-industry-grows","fields":{"headline":"Thames Water could delay accounts as turmoil in water industry grows ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thames Water has refused to say when it will publish its annual report and accounts, which had been expected by investors next week, as concerns mount over the company’s financial viability. The risk of delay will add to the turmoil engulfing England’s 11 privatised water companies, after a day in which board directors, ministers and regulators scrambled to restore calm as discussions continued over a potential temporary nationalisation of Thames Water. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that England’s largest water company, which serves 15 million customers in an area than spans the Thames Valley from London to Oxford and beyond, may have to spend £10bn improving its pipes and treatment works to meet the legal minimums required by regulators. In other developments: The Environment Agency (EA) announced it was sending specialist investigators into water companies across England to secure evidence in the biggest criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping since privatisation. The experienced City troubleshooter Sir Adrian Montague was parachuted in to take over as chairman of Thames, a role he will take up on 10 July. The prime minister’s spokesperson said it was for Ofwat “in the first instance” to monitor the financial resilience of water companies, adding to pressure on the regulator. Thames Water is under a regulatory obligation to file its financial results by 15 July, when its accounts for the year to March 2023 would be made public. In previous years it has filed during the first week of July, and investors said they had been told by the company to mark 4 July as the publication date for 2023. However, the company is refusing to say publicly whether the accounts will appear next week, or even before the regulator’s deadline. Sources familiar with the emergency talks are raising questions about whether the financial issues could cause its auditor, PwC, to delay signing off the accounts. PwC has declined to comment. Ofwat tried to restore calm on Thursday. Releasing a “statement on financial resilience in the water sector”, it said Thames Water had “significant issues to address” but that the company had “strong liquidity”, having recently received an additional £500m from shareholders, and it now had £4.4bn in cash and committed funding. Downing Street said the prime minister had “full confidence” in Ofwat and its ability to monitor the situation, and that the regulator was “focused on doing their job to keep companies’ financial resilience under close scrutiny”. The health minister Neil O’Brien sought to reassure Thames customers, telling the BBC: “Absolutely nothing is going to happen in terms of either their bills or their access to water.” Meanwhile, the EA revealed it was stepping up an investigation into illegal sewage dumping, with the agency’s teams uncovering what they say is potentially widespread non-compliance with rules on sewage treatment across 10 water companies. The EA investigation, launched in November 2021, is running parallel to an investigation by Ofwat into the financial impacts on companies of failure to comply with the rules around sewage discharges. Breaching the permit rules means sewage discharges are illegal and water firms can be prosecuted. A failure to meet permit requirements could also lead to water companies being stripped of their licences to operate. The criminal inquiry is the largest since investigators spent five years examining illegal sewage dumping by Southern Water. Their investigation led to the water company being fined a record £90m by a crown court judge. Investigators will be visiting some of the 2,200 sewage treatment plants run by Thames Water and other companies to secure evidence as they prepare their case. The investigation was sparked by research by Prof Peter Hammond that suggested the scale of illegal sewage dumping by water companies was 10 times what the EA had believed it to be. The agency said: “Our initial assessment indicates that there may have been widespread and serious non-compliance of environmental permit conditions by all companies. We take the implications of this extremely seriously and are committed to understanding the scale and impact of any alleged offending.” The crisis in the water industry has reignited a debate about whether the regional monopolies created by privatisation in 1989 should be taken back into public ownership. Over three decades, Thames Water has been saddled with debt by a succession of owners, with the company now owing £14bn to its creditors and struggling to raise the cash needed to maintain its infrastructure. The company is in talks with the Treasury, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Ofwat about a solution that could involve it being placed under a special administration regime, under which its current owners would hand over management to officials. Thames Water has turned to Montague, a City veteran whom several British governments have tapped up to manage financial challenges at infrastructure companies. He will take over from Ian Marchant, who told the board in April that he would stand down next month. As deputy chair of Network Rail, Montague helped to create the non-profit, government-controlled company to take on the running of Britain’s railway tracks after the 2001 collapse of Railtrack. He helped to lay foundations for a sale of British Energy, which operated UK nuclear power plants, after it faced severe financial difficulties. The heavily indebted Yorkshire Water said it had raised £500m on Monday to shore up its balance sheet. Its shareholders include Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and the US private equity group Corsair Capital. The vast bulk of the cash will be funnelled immediately into the repayment of an intercompany loan. These sorts of loans have become common in a sector that has grown increasingly burdened by debt in recent years and Ofwat has sought to rein in their use. Yorkshire Water and Thames Water are two of five firms that Ofwat said it believed to be in precarious financial positions, along with Portsmouth Water, Southern Water and SES Water. A spokesperson for Thames Water declined to comment on the size of the cash injection it needed but said it retained “a strong liquidity position” and that it was working “constructively” with shareholders. • This article was amended on 3 July 2023 to temporarily remove the graphic on “gearing” pending a review of the figure shown for Severn Trent.

Officials blamed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine for the halting of gas deliveries to Europe. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller indicated that Siemens could not perform repairs on the turbines damaged by the oil leak because of sanctions against the Russian state energy giant. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, told reporters that six of the experts remain at the site to continue with the work. He said the team will produce a report early next week of their findings. Grossi added military operations are increasing in the region of the plant “which worries me a lot” and that the military presence were not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team, and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit. Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, G7 ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin warned that imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders decide to impose price caps on Russian oil, it will lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” will likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said. Rafael Grossi, who led a team of inspectors to the Russian-controlled plant on Thursday, said that although he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. An expert team from the UN nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” Grossi told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion. “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country,” Pushilin said. “This is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” Ukraine’s military said it carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar near a nuclear power plant where U.N. experts are working, Reuters reports. The revelation by the armed forces’ general staff was unusual, since the military rarely gives details of specific targets. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhodar. “It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers,” the general staff said in a Facebook post. Gazprom officials have already blamed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine for the halting of gas deliveries to Europe. In a statement, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller indicated that Siemens could not perform repairs on the turbines damaged by the oil leak because of sanctions against the Russian state energy giant. “Siemens currently has almost no possibility to provide regular overhauls of our gas-pumping units. Siemens simply has nowhere to do this work,” Miller said, according to Interfax. Russia has asked for 56 visas from the United States to allow Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his delegation to travel to New York for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations this month, but so far has received none. In a letter to U.N. secretary general Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said this was “alarming” because during the past several months Washington had “been constantly refusing to grant entry visas” to a number of Russian delegates for other U.N. events. The United States takes seriously its obligations as U.N. host country, said a State Department spokesperson, adding that visa records are confidential under U.S. law so it could not comment on individual cases. On Tuesday, Grossi says he will be briefing the UN Security Council on the findings from their visit. And that concludes the press conference from Vienna. Grossi says the IAEA is planning a bigger safety structure for the plant. Grossi says he does not want to compare the situation at the plant to other examples such as Chernobyl. Grossi says the military presence were not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team, and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit. Grossi says he hopes the IAEA does not have to be a constant presence there and the day comes when the plant is operating normally and inspectors and experts can visit occasionally. Grossi says the IAEA will not be “manipulated” by any member states and does not listen to external noise. Grossi reiterates that international inspectors being there and reporting back 24/7 could be a “stabilising factor” in terms of the safety and security of the plant. The IAEA chief adds another crisis centre has been set up at the plant. He adds that everything that he requested to be seen was inspected. Grossi says he would never send a person to a place that he would not go to first. He adds his team on the ground at the Zaporizhzhia plant are in constant communication with him. Grossi says the military operations are increasing in the region of the plant “which worries me a lot”. He says the statistical probability of further physical damage to the plant therefore is high since shelling began there in August. Grossi reiterates the plant is operating and there is a professional dynamic between the nuclear experts. He says it is “admirable” for the Ukraine experts to continue to work there under the circumstances but admits there is “a tension” due to the war. Grossi says the team will produce a report early next week of their findings. Grossi describes the situation as “extremely complex and challenging” which needs the permanent support of the IAEA. Grossi, whose team landed back in Vienna a few minutes ago, said there are no major problems logistically and a “mixed bag” with the systems. On the outside power supply, Grossi says on several occasions there were blackouts and interruptions of the supply to the outside. On the safety and security systems, Grossi says it is not fully functioning but not in the critical red zone. Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says they saw miulitary activity around the plant and markings on buildings so the “physical integirty of the facilities has been violated several times” which he brands unacceptable. Grossi, who completed a first tour of the key areas of the Russian-occupied power plant, begins by saying six of the experts remain at the site to continue with the work. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, is due to give a press conference shortly in Vienna after returning from the Zaporizhzhia plant. We’ll be providing updates from it here. Joe Biden will request $11.7bn (£10.2bn) in emergency funding from Congress to provide lethal aid and budget support to Ukraine, the White House has said. The emergency funding request will also include $2bn (£1.7bn) to address the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine on US energy supplies, according to Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom shared what it said was a picture showing leaked oil on equipment at the compressor station. From Reuters’ Felix Light: Here’s more on Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany will not be restarted as planned tomorrow. The Russian state energy company said the decision to keep the Baltic Sea pipeline shut was due to an oil leak detected at the Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. Gazprom has now said it needs to fix the problem before the flows can restart, with no indication of how long that may take. Similar oil leaks have previously been detected at some other turbines, which are out of action now, and “complete elimination of oil leakage on these turbines is possible only in the conditions of a specialised repair company,” Gazprom said. The pipeline was due to reopen on Saturday following a three-day break, after the company cited the need to carry out repairs in a move that heightened already acute nervousness over the reliability of winter energy supplies. Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to supply Germany and others, was running at 20% capacity even before flows were halted this week. As the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour writes, the latest move is a brutal show of force by Russia and comes after G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil earlier today. The Russian energy giant Gazprom has announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing damage to the turbine engine. In a statement, the company did not give a time frame for restarting the pipeline, claiming it detected an oil leak at the main gas turbine at Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. It said the turbine could not operate safely until the leak was repaired. Ukraine declared this week it had begun a counteroffensive aiming to retake Kherson – the one city Russia holds west of the Dnieper river – prompting a fog of uncertainty to descend on how the effort was progressing, never mind whether it would succeed. Oleksiy Arestovych, a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, stressed there would be “no quick wins” as the attack in the south began – a point reflected in a briefing on Friday by western officials. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officials said Ukraine had “pushed back” the Russian defenders in “several places”, but insisted it was too soon to name villages taken or distances gained while fighting was ongoing. The caution may be realistic, but it is also telling. This is not, in any sense, a blitzkrieg or a broad front attack, but rather a localised effort to strike at the most obvious strategic vulnerability in the Russian frontline, and to try to demonstrate that Ukraine can drive the Russians back in places before winter sets in. It is a struggle about Kyiv’s ability to act proactively as much as it is about recapturing the occupied city itself. Read Dan Sabbagh’s full analysis: Push to retake Kherson is symbol of Ukraine’s cautious confidence A woman from eastern Ukraine has been detained after she was accused of sending the locations of her soldier husband’s unit to Russian military intelligence, according to Ukraine’s state security service. The 31-year-old unnamed woman from the Dnipropetrovsk region passed on information about the locations of military buildings and equipment along frontline positions in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, it said in a statement. The agency said the woman would question her husband about the location of his unit and other Ukrainian formations on the frontline. She would then pass on the information “through messenger applications to Russian military intelligence, where it was used for artillery and airstrikes”, it said. The statement continued: She took this step despite the fact that she is married to a serviceman of the armed forces of Ukraine, and that they have a son together. The G7 countries have agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlin’s war coffers. Finance ministers from the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada have agreed a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices. The proposal would mean importers seeking shipping services and insurance cover from companies based in G7 and EU countries would need to adhere to a price cap to transport Russian oil. The cap is expected to be introduced at the same time as planned EU embargoes on Russian oil kick in – on 5 December for crude and 5 February for refined products, such as diesel. The level of the cap is still being discussed. UK chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the decision followed a meeting earlier this week with US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen in Washington. Yellen said the measure would be implemented “in the weeks to come” and represents a “major blow for Russian finances and will hinder Russia’s ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine”.

The agreement by G7 finance ministers to impose a price cap on Russian oil will “curtail Putin’s capacity to fund his war” in Ukraine, Britain’s chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said. In a statement, Zahawi said further action against Putin was a “personal priority as Chancellor”. Zahawi said: Since Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the UK and our allies have imposed hugely damaging sanctions on the Kremlin war machine, pushing the Russian economy into a deep recession and putting the majority of Russia’s 640 billion dollars foreign exchange reserves beyond use. He added: We will curtail Putin’s capacity to fund his war from oil exports by banning services, such as insurance and the provision of finance, to vessels carrying Russian oil above an agreed price cap. We are united against this barbaric aggression and will do all we can to support Ukraine as they fight for sovereignty, democracy and freedom. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced nations have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, G7 ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. They confirmed their commitment to the plan after a virtual meeting but said the per-barrel level of the price cap would be determined later “based on a range of technical inputs” to be agreed by the coalition of countries. The G7 ministers said: Today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally. The price cap is is “specifically designed” to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia’s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries”, they said. The G7 consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes, Reuters reports. The country’s grain exports have slumped since the start of the war because its Black Sea ports, a key route for shipments, were closed off. Three ports were unblocked at the end of July under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The government has said Ukraine could harvest at least 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, has said that a G7 price cap on Russian oil would help fight inflation while delivering a blow to Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The price cap helps achieve “our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine”, Yellen said in a statement. Reuters reports that Japanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki has also said he welcomed a G7 deal, and that it should be implemented quickly. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), has posted to Telegram to say that reactor number five, which was shut down yesterday as an emergency precaution following shelling in the vicinity, has begun operating again. The statement said: Power unit number five of the ZNPP, which was shut down yesterday morning as a result of another mortar shelling by the Russian occupying forces at the ZNPP site, was connected to the power grid at 1.10pm, and capacity is being added. Currently, two power units are operating at the station, which produce electricity for the needs of Ukraine. There are no comments on the operation of equipment and security systems. We will remind you that representatives of the IAEA mission continue their work at the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counteroffensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. G7 finance ministers are expected to firm up plans on Friday to impose a price cap on Russian oil aimed at slashing revenues for Moscow’s war in Ukraine but keeping crude flowing to avoid price rises, officials said. The ministers from the club of wealthy industrial democracies are due to meet virtually and are likely to issue a communique that lays out their implementation plans. “A deal is likely,” a European G7 official said, adding that it was unclear how much detail would be revealed, such as the per-barrel level of the price cap, above which complying countries would refuse insurance and finance to Russian crude and oil product cargoes. Read the full story here. Russian forces are suffering “heavy losses” in the face of Ukrainian resistance that has stalled Moscow’s advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people to “retake their sovereign territory”, the UK’s national security adviser, Stephen Lovegrove, has said. In a statement, Lovegrove said Britain will continue to provide Ukraine with humanitarian, economic and military assistance and that its support “will not waver”. Ukraine’s resistance “has inspired the world and shown huge courage in the face of brutality”, he said. Lovegrove said: Now that courageous resistance has stalled the Russian advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people and armed forces to retake their sovereign territory. He added: The risks around this terrible conflict continue as Putin finds he can’t make progress, his forces suffer heavy losses, and sanctions continue to degrade his war machine and take money out of the pockets of Russia’s richest people. At the same time Russia is trying and failing to impose a veneer of legitimacy on the areas it temporarily controls, including through plans for staged sham referenda. It will not succeed. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has responded to comments by the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about putting a ceiling on the price Europe pays for Russian gas. Russia will simply turn off gas supply to Europe if Brussels pushes ahead with a price cap on Russian gas, Medvedev wrote on Telegram. The Kremlin has warned it will stop selling oil to countries that impose price caps on Russia’s energy resources. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven are expected to firm up plans today to impose a price cap on Russian oil aimed at slashing revenues for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The ministers from the club of wealthy industrial democracies are due to meet virtually, and could issue a communique that lays out their implementation plans. If G7 leaders decide to impose price caps on Russian oil, it will lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: Companies that impose a price cap will not be among the recipients of Russian oil. We simply will not cooperate with them on non-market principles. He added: One thing can be said with confidence: such a move will lead to a significant destabilisation of the oil markets. Peskov’s comments came as the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was time for the EU to consider a similar price cap on Russian gas purchases. Such a cap would help fight back against Vladimir Putin’s attempts to manipulate the European energy market, Von der Leyen said. World food prices have fallen for a fifth consecutive month, partly due to the resumption of exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, according to the UN. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which tracks the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, reached an all-time high in March after Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Since then, the FAO index has been falling steadily, declining by 1.9% in August. Vegetable oils fell by 3.3% in August, below their level a year ago. Cereals dropped by 1.4%, driven by a 5.1% drop in international wheat prices. It came off the back of “improved production prospects in North America and Russia as well as the resumption of exports from the Black Sea ports in Ukraine for the first time in over five months of interruption”, the FAO said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command. Humeniuk said: The enemy suffers quite significant losses — losses in manpower have gone from tens to hundreds. Equipment also burns. More “positive news” will likely follow “very soon”, she added: We continue to destroy the enemy in terms of its logistics, capabilities, capacities. Ammunition warehouses explode, pontoon crossings explode. It means that the enemy’s logistics and transport connections are undermined to such an extent that they cannot raise reserves. Operational Command South claimed that a range of targets had been struck, including a ferry crossing. Moscow has denied reports of Ukrainian progress and said its troops had routed Ukrainian forces. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. Hello everyone.

An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of experts had stayed behind at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he told reporters. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Friday “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continues to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” Russia and China launched large-scale military exercises involving several allied nations on Thursday, in a show of growing defence cooperation between Moscow and Beijing and a demonstration of Moscow’s military might. The Russian defence ministry said the Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise would be held until Wednesday in Russia’s far east and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops and 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships. US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency is investigating allegations that two senior civil servants could have been spying for Russia, according to a local media reports on Thursday. Die Zeit, which first revealed the case, said the officials being investigated had close involvement with energy supply issues and held key positions. Children returned to Ukrainian schools trashed by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. Over the last couple of days, the main story of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been the inspection of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If you missed it, yesterday we published this video report from on the ground in Nikopol, the city that lies across the river from the ZNPP, and which is being regularly fired upon by Russian forces. The residents live in fear of a nuclear accident. Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry spoke to some of them the morning after yet another Russian attack. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has posted a series of images on Telegram that he states illustrate the overnight destruction of a sports facility in Kharkiv. He writes: The occupiers have once again struck the peaceful infrastructure of Kharkiv. Around midnight the Russians destroyed the premises of the Lokomotiv sports complex named after H Kirpa with S-300 missile strikes. This is the world sports arena, where our champions in synchronised swimming trained. World stars from various sports, medalists of the Olympic Games performed in these walls. The swimming pool, the modern boxing club, which was inaugurated only in February of this year, were destroyed. The Russians are once again committing terror against the civilian population. The Russian defence ministry has issued some images of the inspection being carried out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) yesterday. It includes images purporting to show fallen munitions in the grounds of the ZNPP. Russian news agencies are reporting that defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). They report that Shoigu accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Russian forces have occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. In another development, the RIA news agency is quoting Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian-imposed administration in Zaporizhzhia accusing Kyiv of trying to infiltrate the IAEA mission with what he described as “spies”. Offering no evidence for the accusation, it quotes him saying “Ukrainian special services, on the orders of Zelenskiy, tried to introduce their spies and saboteurs working under journalistic cover into the IAEA delegation to the ZNPP. An attempt to infiltrate spies and saboteurs under the guise of Ukrainian journalists was stopped. They were not allowed into the territory.” Earlier today the Ukrainian operator of the plant, Energoatom, complained that journalists had been prevented from accompanying the UN inspection team, writing: The vast majority of “media from the rest of the world” who arrived at the power plant yesterday are Russian propagandists. Buses with Ukrainian and foreign journalists who tried to get to the ZNPP along with IAEA mission via the territory of Ukraine were not passed through the checkpoint by the Russian military. Additionally, Energoatom claimed that “The invaders deliberately blocked cellular communications and the internet in Enerhodar in order to prevent the forwarding of pictures and videos from ZNPP and its satellite city.” None of these claims have been independently verified. Reuters is reporting that two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis, according to a statement from Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna to the RIA Novosti news agency. More details soon … The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has been quoted on one of the DPR’s Telegram channels speaking again about the military expansion plans of the pro-Russian forces occupying Ukraine. The channel quotes Denis Pushilin speaking as part of what it describes as a “federal education marathon”. Pushilin says: Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia, but also much wider. We still have a lot to do, and in what form they will return home, we will see, moreover, we will participate in this. It will not be any other way. Novorossia was a proposed confederation between the DPR and the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) in the east of Ukraine whose formation stalled in 2015. The term Novorossiya has also historically referred to an area of southern Ukraine on the Black Sea coast stretching from the Donbas in the east to the border with Moldova in the west, incorporating Odesa and going as far north as Dnipro. The DPR and LPR are only recognised as legitimate authorities by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken again about the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in a video streamed to a meeting in Italy. Reuters quotes him saying: We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station. I hope the mission will comply with what we’ve agreed and that it will serve the interests of the entire international community. Zelenskiy also said that ensuring the ZNPP returns to operating safely and remains connected to the country’s power grid would help his country act to counter Europe’s energy crisis. Ukraine’s president was addressing the European House, Ambrosetti Forum meeting in Cernobbio. In its daily operational briefing, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine has said that Russia’s current main aim remains to seize full control of Donetsk. It writes: The opponent continues to focus efforts on establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. The enemy launches air and missile strikes at military and civilian objects in the territory of our State. In the Donetsk direction, the enemy’s main efforts are focused on conducting offensive actions on the Bakhmut and Avdiivka directions. In a separate post on Facebook, the Ukrainian armed forces has updated the total casualty count, claiming to have killed a further 350 pro-Russian service personnel in the last 24 hours and to have inflicted a total loss of 48,700 people on the occupying forces. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, the region bordering Kherson in southern Ukraine, has detailed the overnight incidents in a status update on Telegram. He lists a large number of villages that came under sporadic fire in the last 24 hours, but states that while a small number of buildings and commercial premises were damaged, only one injury has been recorded. Russian news agency Tass is carrying a quote from Alexander Volga, head of the Russian-imposed occupation administration of Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) is located. It reports he said on Russian television that eight people from the IAEA mission remain at the ZNPP, alongside four more people, who he described as service personnel who accompany them through their activities. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), has this morning republished on its Telegram channel some overnight quotes from Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko. He told Ukrainian television: The IAEA mission must state that the presence of the military, the presence of weapons at the station, is a real threat to nuclear safety. This is obvious. This mission is unique because there are no analogues in the history of the IAEA at all. Missions took place at objects that were controlled by states. But there was no such mission format as it is now. Recommendations and reports of the IAEA should be sent to Ukraine and Energoatom. And we must implement these recommendations, and eliminate the consequences of the barbaric actions of the occupiers. But for that we need to have access to the station. It should be returned under the control of Ukraine. Oleh Synyehubov, Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram this morning to say that overnight rocket attacks took place in his region on the Kholodnohirskyi district of Kharkiv. He also listed five other areas that had seen artillery fire, and gave a casualty list of three women being hospitalised in Izyum, and a 63-year-old man being killed in Kharkiv. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Requests for gas on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Europe are up for early 3 September, the operator’s website reportedly showed on Thursday. Gas nominations were at 14,437,507 kilowatt hours per hour (kwh/h) from 2-3am CET for 3 September, Reuters reported the website as showing. The news agency described nominations as essentially capacity requests for gas transport and can be changed by the supplier when needed. When they are changed they are described as renominations, but those can also still be changed. Gazprom this week said that a three-day maintenance of the Portovaya compressor station would last from 31 August, 1am GMT (3am CET) until 3 September, 1am GMT (3am CET). Heavy fighting continues in southern Ukraine, including shelling in Enerhodar district, near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The ministry also offered a scathing observation of Moscow’s “Vostok 22” annual military exercises it commenced on Thursday. “Russia publicly claimed that 50,000 troops will take part, however, it’s unlikely that more than 15,000 personnel will be actively involved this year,” the latest British intelligence report reads. “This is around 20% of the forces which participated in the last Vostok exercise in 2018.” Russia’s military strategic exercises, such as Vostok, are “heavily scripted, do not encourage initiative, and primarily aim to impress Russian leaders and international audiences” while failing to sustain the military’s ability to conduct large scale, complex operations, the ministry added. Russian officials at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station are manipulating and distorting information shared with IAEA officials, Ukrainian officials have said. Ukrainian state owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the International Atomic Energy Agency mission from getting to know the real state of affairs” at the Russian-held power plant. “They spread manipulative and false information about this visit,” the company added in a statement shared to its Telegram channel this morning. An employee spoke with Ukrainian media outlet Suspilny on condition of anonymity: They led Grossi and the inspectors along their route, showed them ‘arrival maps’ and brought local collaborators to them with statements from ‘indifferent citizens’ about the need to stop the shelling. It was a circus,” said the ZNPP employee. According to the employee, the Russians convinced the representatives of the mission that radiological, chemical and biological protection troops, and not combat units of the Russian army, were at the station. Russia’s foreign minister has warned that any actions seen as endangering a Russian peacekeeping contingent in a separatist region of Moldova would be considered as an attack on Russia itself. Sergei Lavrov’s statement in an address at Russia’s top foreign affairs school on on Thursday underlined concerns that Moldova’s Transnistria region, which borders Ukraine, could be drawn into the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia has stationed peacekeepers there since a three-month war in 1992 that left Transnistria outside Moldovan control. Russian forces also guard a large ammunition dump in the region. In April, tensions in Moldova soared after a series of explosions in Transnistria. Everyone should understand that any kind of actions that will raise a threat to the security of our servicemen will be considered in accordance with international law as an attack on the Russian Federation,” Lavrov said. After Lavrov’s comments, Moldova’s foreign ministry summoned Russia’s charge d’affaires for “clarification”. We remind the Russian side that the legislation of the Republic of Moldova guarantees fundamental human rights and freedoms,” the ministry said. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, as he voiced his fears for the site. Rafael Grossi led a team of inspectors to the Russian-controlled plant that has been frequently shelled in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear incident. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters after he returned with part of his team to the Ukrainian-controlled area on Thursday. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant,” he said, while adding that the situation was “more predictable” now. The UN nuclear agency chief said his experts were staying put after they crossed on Thursday into Russian-held territory in Ukraine and reached Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, where both sides warn of potential catastrophe. An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team braved intense shelling to reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, arriving after a delay of several hours in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby. We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving. It’s going to stay there,” IAEA head Rafael Grossi, who personally led the mission, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable,” he said. Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of creating a risk of a Chernobyl-like disaster by shelling near the plant, where the situation has been unravelling in recent weeks. Russia seized the plant early in the now more than six-month-old war. Kyiv also accuses Russia of using the facility to shield its forces, and of planning to steal its output by hooking it up to the Russian power grid. Moscow denies this but has so far rejected international calls to withdraw its troops from the plant. Video footage released by Russia’s state news agency RIA showed IAEA inspectors, including Grossi, wearing safety helmets and being shown around the site by Russian energy officials, who pointed out what were described as damaged water pipes. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after agency chief Rafael Grossi warned that the physical integrity of the plant had been violated on several occasions. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory.

Die Zeit, which first revealed the case, said the officials being investigated had close involvement with energy supply issues and held key positions. A senior Russian oil executive has died after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Children returned to Ukrainian schools trashed by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. All children who attend are told to carry an emergency bag with a change of clothes, any medicine they may need, a note from their parents and, for the younger children, a favourite toy. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/09/zelenskiy-steps-up-criticism-of-international-red-cross-over-inaction-at-kharkhova-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T04:00:50Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy steps up criticism of International Red Cross over inaction at Kakhovka dam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/zelenskiy-steps-up-criticism-of-international-red-cross-over-inaction-at-kharkhova-dam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/09/zelenskiy-steps-up-criticism-of-international-red-cross-over-inaction-at-kharkhova-dam","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy steps up criticism of International Red Cross over inaction at Kakhovka dam","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy – well schooled in chiding the west for being slow in providing help – has shifted his line of criticism from the pace at which arms has been reaching his country to the slow international response to the humanitarian and ecological disaster caused by the breach of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam. Before visiting the flood-affected areas on Thursday, he used his nightly address to say: “Large-scale efforts are needed. We need international organisations, such as the International Committee on Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help the people in the occupied part of Kherson region. Each person that dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organisations that have forgotten how to save lives. If there is no international organisation in the area of this disaster now, it means it does not exist at all and that it is incapable of functioning.” He told the German newspaper Der Bild that the UN and the ICRC “are not there”. His remarks reflect his anger that the UN – and much international reporting – is not yet rebutting Russian claims of innocence over the dam’s destruction, or focusing on the Russian failure to help those on the occupied left bank to which the UN and the ICRC says they have been denied access by Moscow. But his criticism is only his latest salvo in his savaging of the performance of the ICRC in Ukraine, as opposed to Red Cross Ukraine. Zelenskiy and his circle believe the Geneva-based organisation has used the cover of neutrality, international law and confidentiality to mask a moral weakness. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian ombudsman for human rights, said last month that every day he is “faced with the fact that the Red Cross does not want to perform its functions. But worst of all, the Red Cross has a monopoly and does not allow other organisations to appear.” He said: “One organisation uses its history its name to get in the way of doing something impactful.” Lubinets added Ukraine wanted a second organisation to be established with co-responsibility for accessing political prisoners, arguing that competition might spur the ICRC to be more proactive. One bone of contention has been the ICRC’s approach to combatants. Ukraine’s anger was sparked by the ICRC’s inability to access Olenivka, a notorious camp in eastern Ukraine where dozens of Ukrainian PoWs died in an explosion and fire in July. In his nightly address on 13 October, Zelenskiy said: “I believe the International Committee of the Red Cross is not a club with privileges where one receives a salary and enjoys life. The Red Cross has obligations, primarily of a moral nature. The mandate of the Red Cross must be fulfilled.” The following month, apparently fed up with the perceived inaction, the president’s office announced the creation of a human rights information staff, saying the ICRC seemed incapable of calling out, or investigating, Russian human rights abuses. In his address later that month to the G20 in Bali, Zelenskiy let rip again, saying: “11,000 children [who were forcibly deported to Russia], hundreds of thousands of deported adults, and … we have not found support in the International Committee of the Red Cross. We do not see that they are fully fighting for access to the camps where Ukrainian prisoners and political prisoners are held, or that they are helping to find deported Ukrainians.” Zelenskiy questioned whether the ICRC could any longer claim the legal and moral right to be the upholders of international humanitarian law: “And such self-elimination is the self-destruction of the Red Cross as an organisation that was once respected.” By contrast, Zelenskiy has expressed admiration for the more pugnacious style of Rafael Grossi, the director of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, which has visited both Russia and Ukraine to uphold safety at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. The natural style of the relatively new head of the ICRC, a former Swiss diplomat, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, is one of discretion. She says the mandate of the ICRC means that it is not an advocacy group or a body capable of mounting inquiries. Faced by a world in which the post-1945 respect for an agreed rules-based order has eroded, she cannot unilaterally enter prison camps or order cooperation from the countries with which she has to deal. Accumulated trust, neutrality and confidentiality are critical components of success for the ICRC, she believes. She has 1,000 staff in Ukraine, and recently said: “The closer you come to the front line, the more people know how important neutrality is because it protects you. We have very little means of assuring safety and security for our staff other than our strict 160-year-old neutrality and impartiality.” She is also facing budget cuts. The ICRC recently announced that it would have to cut 1,800 jobs to save $440m (£350m) from its $3.2bn budget. Efforts were clearly under way on Thursday to patch up relations with meetings between UN and Ukrainian officials in Kherson. The Ukrainian Red Cross was also stressing that it was active on the ground. The ICRC rejected the criticism saying the response from the Ukraine Red Cross “was immediate” and its teams had already evacuated hundreds of people. “The ICRC’s primary focus is on access to water. Our experts work with the National Red Cross Society and local authorities, and we will supply goods and equipment over the coming days,” a statement said. The organisation added its work with political prisoners had given more than 5,500 families on both sides news of their loved ones since February 202. In a statement, UN’s humanitarian body said it had organised water trucking and delivered more than 100,000 bottles of drinking water, water purification tablets and jerrycans to affected communities in the Kherson region. The UN coordinator on humanitarian affairs, Martin Griffiths, a hugely experienced British diplomat, insists his teams are already active on the ground, and he was working to gain access to Russian-controlled areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T13:03:16Z","webTitle":"UK ministers float plan for ‘hydrogen-ready’ domestic boilers from 2026","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers float plan for ‘hydrogen-ready’ domestic boilers from 2026","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ministers are considering requiring that all new domestic boilers be “hydrogen-ready” from 2026, as they announced £100m for nuclear and hydrogen projects. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has launched a consultation on improving boiler standards, and has argued there is a strong case for introducing hydrogen-ready boilers in the UK from 2026. The government is examining options to replace polluting fossil fuel gas in Britain’s energy system and has offered grants for households to install heat pumps. A ban on gas boilers in new homes comes into force in 2025, although uncertainty remains over the timeframe for the phase-out of fossil gas in existing homes. Hydrogen-ready boilers are initially installed to burn fossil gas but then can be easily converted to operate on hydrogen by an engineer. The consultation document argues that the strategy will reduce “the costs associated with scrapping natural gas-only boilers before the end of their useful life”. “Mandating hydrogen-ready boilers will give industry the confidence to prepare supply chains to ensure the benefits of the potential transition are maximised,” officials said. However, they cautioned that there is no guarantee that boilers will ultimately be converted to run on hydrogen. While hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in the decarbonisation of heavy industry and the transport network, opinion is split on the practicality of using it in Britain’s gas network and the resulting cost to households. Plans for a pilot to examine the effectiveness of using hydrogen have met local opposition in Whitby, outside Ellesmere Port, where residents have expressed concerns over becoming “lab rats”. The consultation, which closes in late March, will also examine the cost of hydrogen-ready boilers. “The government needs confidence that consumers will not face a premium for their purchase,” it said. Separately on Tuesday, the government announced £77m of funding to aid nuclear fuel production and develop nuclear reactors, and £25m for technologies that can produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste, while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Late last month, the government committed £700m to the Sizewell C nuclear power station project in Suffolk. A search for further investors into the development, which is led by France’s EDF, is ongoing. The funding includes up to £60m for the next phase of research into high temperature gas reactors, with a target of using them by the early 2030s. The energy and climate minister, Graham Stuart, said: “This funding package will strengthen our energy security, by ensuring we have a safe and secure supply of domestic nuclear fuel services, while also creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:18:38Z","webTitle":"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","fields":{"headline":"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson claimed on Thursday that his energy security strategy had delivered “clean, affordable, secure power to the people for generations to come”. In comments issued as he launched the policy at Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset and put atomic energy front and centre of his plan, the prime minister said his government was the first for years that had not “dodged the big decisions on energy”. Yet within hours, critics spoke of a lack of ambition, particularly around onshore wind and energy efficiency, avenues that experts say offer the best and quickest hope of bringing down bills and achieving energy self-sufficiency. So what exactly is in the plan and what is missing from it? Nuclear Peak winter electricity demand is about 60 gigawatts and National Grid expects that to be 85GW by 2050, as vehicles and home heating are increasingly electrified, with a safety buffer needed on top of that. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, an effort to be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. The first phase will involve eight new nuclear reactors, equivalent to four 3GW power stations. Sizewell C is set for approval within this parliamentary term. Two more will follow in the next, with Wylfa on Anglesey the front-runner. After that, projects could be located at approved sites such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. Small nuclear reactors of nearly 0.5GW each will be part of the mix, with both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi working on projects. The recently approved “regulated asset base” funding model will transfer risk to the taxpayer, allaying risk-aversion among private firms, which has stymied recent development. Ministers have not ruled out taking a stake in individual plants. There will, however, be no nuclear power plants in Scotland, whose parliament has reaffirmed its opposition. Wind “We will be the Saudi Arabia of wind power,” the government claims. Offshore wind targets have been scaled up, from 40GW to 50GW, with planning reforms intended to cut delivery times, which can be up to 13 years. But Tory infighting has turned onshore into a sore point. A leaked version of the energy plan, first reported by the i newspaper, include a target of 45GW by 2035, up from nearly 15GW now. That disappeared in the final document, after anti-wind Tory MPs refused to countenance overhauling planning laws that make onshore all but impossible to develop in England. The government says it will look at offering local communities cheaper electricity bills in return for their consent but will not rip up those obstructive planning rules. No such prohibition exists in Scotland, which is better suited to onshore than England thanks to greater wind speeds and more remote locations. In a TV clip at Hinkley Point C, Johnson said onshore turbines were “controversial with people”. “People feel that they affect the beauty of the countryside, I totally understand that.” However, polling by YouGov in 2021 shows two thirds of people support onshore wind projects, even in rural areas. Solar Solar is in line for one of the biggest expansions. The plan envisages a fivefold increase that could take the total capacity from 14GW to 70GW by 2035. Unlike onshore wind, this could be underpinned by planning reform that favours development on non-protected sites. Energy efficiency The energy security plan contains no major new investment in upgrading leaky homes to make them easier and cheaper to heat, despite the price of gas – the heat source for 90% of homes – hitting historic highs. As recently as 2012, the UK was upgrading 2.3m homes a year thanks to government funding that was cut when David Cameron vowed to eliminate “green crap”, slowing the rate to a trickle. The energy security plan offers very little to reignite that drive to insulate the UK, enraging environmental groups. Oil and gas The government’s renewable proposals have been accompanied by firmer support for oil and gas, further inflaming the ire of environmentalists. North Sea drillers will be encouraged to seek new licences, although the government hasn’t quantified what impact it expects this to have on production. Having banned fracking in 2019, the government will commission an “impartial” review by the British Geological Survey into whether it can be done safely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin-appointed Kherson leader reportedly flees to Russia; first grain ship docks in Africa – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin-appointed Kherson leader reportedly flees to Russia; first grain ship docks in Africa – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. A senior presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, cautioned Ukrainians not to expect rapid gains and described the offensive as a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The former head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6, has welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia after Kyiv announced it had begun its long-awaited counterattack aimed at taking back the southern region from Russian forces. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least four people died and four more were injured.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has met the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, and his delegation ahead of the group’s visit to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the IAEA inspectors to force them through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventative safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5m people for a month. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s more on the meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, in Kyiv today. Grossi arrived in the Ukrainian capital late on Monday at the head of a 14-strong team before a visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskiy said the mission was “probably one of the top-priority questions regarding the safety of Ukraine and the world today”, and called for the “immediate de-militarisation of the plant” and its transfer to “full Ukrainian control”. The Ukrainian president said he hoped the delegation would “find an opportunity, thanks to our special services, thanks to the security corridors, to get to the station and do the best to avoid all those threats on a global scale”. He also urged the mission to do more than inspect the plant, saying that strategic decisions were required “regarding the urgent demilitarisation of the station, the withdrawal of all, any, military personnel of the Russian Federation with explosives, with any kind of weapon”. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been “struck by artillery fire” and is “located only a few dozen kilometres from the front line”, the agency said in a statement. The statement followed a meeting of the agency’s director, Audrey Azoulay, and Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, in Paris. The agency added: On 24 July 2022, part of the large glass roof and windows of Odesa’s Museum of Fine Arts, inaugurated in 1899, were destroyed. It said it had mobilised experts to support Ukraine so that the nomination can be examined urgently by World Heritage Committee member states. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Russian state prosecutors have requested a 24-year prison term for the former journalist, Ivan Safronov, who is on trial for treason, his defence team has told Russian media. Safronov, 32, was one of Russia’s most respected journalists covering defence for the Kommersant and Vedomosti newspapers. He was arrested in July 2020 after leaving journalism to serve as an aide to the head of Russia’s space agency. He has been accused by Russia’s FSB security service of collecting military secrets about Russian arms sales in the Middle East and Africa and handing them over to the Czech Republic. Safronov has denied the charges and described the trial as “a complete travesty of justice”. Speaking to the Russian state-owned news agency, Ria, after a closed-door hearing, Safronov’s lawyer, Dmitry Katchev, said: The prosecutor asked to sentence Ivan to 24 years in a strict regime penal colony. Safronov’s previous lawyer, Yevgeny Smirnov, said on Facebook that his former client had turned down an offer of 12 years in jail in return for a guilty plea. The verdict in his case will be announced on 5 September, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has met the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, and his delegation ahead of the group’s visit to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. From the Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne: The deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, said in a telephone interview that “everything in Kherson was under control”, claiming that Ukrainian spies and saboteurs were killed near Kherson’s Tavriiskyi neighbourhood on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, reports emerged that Stremousov had left Kherson after a video he posted appeared to indicate he was located in Voronezh, a Russian city some 600 miles from Kherson. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. He said: I don’t have to sit [in Kherson]. I am the deputy head of the region and have the opportunity to move around … These are working trips. “Kherson will remain my base,” he added, denying he left Kherson out of safety concerns. Stremousov became the most senior Russian-appointed official in Kherson after the local governor, Volodymyr Saldo, was taken to hospital amid a suspected poisoning earlier in the summer. Stremousov’s apparent departure from Kherson comes after another Russian-appointed official in the region, Alexei Kovalev, was shot dead in his home over the weekend. In the past months, a number of Ukrainian nationals appointed by Russian forces in occupied territory have been killed or wounded in apparent partisan attacks. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia, one day after Kyiv announced it had begun its long-awaited counter attack aimed at taking back the southern region from Russian forces. Kirill Stremousov, who was appointed deputy head of the Russian-backed Kherson military-civilian administration, has published regular video updates to state-owned Russian news outlets and his Telegram account. But a Ukrainian activist, Serhii Sternenko, has claimed Stremousov is no longer in Kherson and has instead been filming his recent video updates somewhere near the Cathedral of Annunciation in Voronezh in Russia, which can be seen in the background. Voronezh is almost 500 miles from Kherson and about 120 miles from the border with Ukraine. In a series of tweets, Sternenko wrote: Traitor to Ukraine and collaborator Stremousov escaped from Kherson and says that Kherson will forever remain Russian ... from Voronezh to Russia. He went on to claim that Stremousov was filming his videos from a Marriott hotel in Voronezh. A selection of images showing recent developments in Ukraine have dropped on the picture wires. The former head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6, has welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. He added that western help had strengthened Ukrainian capability and that there was a long-term trend showing Russian military capability had slowly weakened. He said the new offensive in Kherson from Zelenskiy’s forces was “all about the urge of Ukraine to demonstrate they can get on the front foot”. It’s nearly 5.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. A senior presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told Ukrainians not to expect rapid gains and described the offensive as a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in co-ordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russian officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have also been reported going off in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog have arrived in Kyiv en route to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the IAEA inspectors to force them through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe.

At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Russia is reportedly struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. The Pentagon believes that any more recruits added may not effectively expand overall combat power by the end of the year, according to a US official. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, according to British intelligence. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply; however, it is not yet possible to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russian officials as saying. Russian media also reported a partial shutdown of the water supply, as well as traffic lights and building lights going off. It comes after Ukrainian forces launched their long-awaited counteroffensive to take back the southern region from Russia. Russia has condemned the destruction of Soviet war memorials in the three Baltic states and accused them of persecuting their Russian-speaking minorities. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia of being guilty of xenophobia and said they were treating their ethnic Russian minorities as “second-class people”. It claimed Russian-language media, kindergartens and schools were being shut down. Such “Russophobic approaches” will “certainly affect the state of bilateral relations with these countries, which are already in complete decline”, the ministry said. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander, carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat, set sail from the Ukrainian port of Yuzhne, east of Odesa, two weeks ago. The vessel is the first specially chartered by the UN’s World Food Programme to unblock food shipments stuck after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will soon be followed by another carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. Michael Dunford, the UN’s World Food Programme director for eastern Africa, said: This shipment, the first of many we hope, will allow WFP to deliver this grain to 1.53 million people in Ethiopia and cover their needs for a month. It’s a start but we must continue to keep the food flowing to save lives across the region. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The Commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventative safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. The tablets would be used “in limited scenarios to avoid that inhaled or swallowed radioactive iodine is absorbed by the thyroid”, the commission said. The EU is “pre-emptively” delivering the potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine to offer people protection “in case of exposure to high levels of radiation”, the commissioner for crisis management, Janez Lenarčič, said in a statement. He added: No nuclear power plant should ever be used as a war theatre. It is unacceptable that civilian lives are put in danger. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for a team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. He also reiterated Ukraine’s call to demilitarise the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. The decoys are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, a senior Ukrainian official told the paper. A source said: When the UAVs see the battery, it’s like a VIP target. The initial success of the replicas has left Ukraine to make more of these wooden decoys in a bid to neutralise Russia’s artillery advantage on the battlefield. In addition, the destruction of Ukraine’s fleet of fake Himars may have been behind Russia’s claims that it has taken out a large number of the systems. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. At his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked to respond to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s comments that Russian troops should flee after his military reportedly broke through several of their defences on Tuesday. Peskov replied: The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in co-ordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled. He also commented on calls by some European leaders for a ban on tourist visas for Russians, describing the proposals as “irrational” and the latest manifestation of the west’s anti-Russian agenda. He said Europe’s actions towards Russia were “bordering on insanity” adding: Of course, such decisions cannot go unanswered. Ukrainian troops have launched a counterattack in southern Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he vowed to take back Russian-controlled areas, starting with Kherson. The Ukrainian president told the Russian military to flee after his military broke through several Russian defences on Tuesday. “There will be no place [for Russian troops] on Ukrainian land,” he said during his latest address posted to Telegram. Radiation levels at the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain normal, according to Russia’s defence ministry. In a statement, the ministry accused Ukrainian forces of firing two artillery shells into the territory of the nuclear power plant. It also claimed that it had a downed Ukrainian drone had crashed into the roof of a building storing nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. It is not possible to independently verify these claims. It is just past 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed Engie it is reducing its gas deliveries, starting Tuesday, due to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies, the French utility company said. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said:”As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in its war with Ukraine, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it is likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added in a Monday evening address: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych described the counteroffensive as a “planned slow operation to grind the enemy”. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: “We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson. The operation began with heavy shelling of Russian positions and the rear, forcing them to flee, the source was quoted as saying. Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes also continue to disrupt Russian resupply. A Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region without water or power, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority told Russia’s RIA news agency. The town lies just to the east of the city of Kherson. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also appeared to confirm the reports on his Telegram channel alongside a video of firefighters dousing burning cars. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting January next year. Ukrainian officials have warned politicians, experts and opinion leaders not to speculate about the progress of a military counteroffensive. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said the operation in Kherson needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added it was necessary to wait for official statements from Ukraine’s ministry of defence and army. “I understand our wishes and dreams … But war is not ‘content’. Let’s filter information and work professionally out of respect for our defenders,” he wrote on Telegram. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. France and Germany said in the joint memo seen by Reuters: We caution against far-reaching restrictions on our visa policy, in order to prevent feeding the Russian narrative and trigger unintended rallying-around the flag effects and/or estranging future generations. Others, in particular eastern and Nordic member states, have argued strongly for a ban. Denmark’s foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said last week: It is very provocative to me that you see Russian men on European beaches in southern Europe and at the same time Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 years cannot even leave their country but have to fight for their freedom. We think it is right that we together in Europe can limit and cut off tourists from Russia and it would send a clear message to (President) Putin. Russians mostly enter the EU via the land borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland, Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said last week, adding that these countries may act on their own if the EU does not agree on a union-wide ban. Russia’s Gazprom has informed Engie it is reducing its gas deliveries, starting today, due to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies, the French utility company said. A statement reported by Reuters said: As previously announced, Engie had already secured the volumes necessary to meet its commitments towards its customers and its own requirements, and put in place several measures to significantly reduce any direct financial and physical impacts that could result from an interruption to gas supplies by Gazprom. However, a French energy ministry official said the state-owned firm’s move to further reduce its gas deliveries to Engie does not jeopardise the security of France’s energy supplies. The official said: We prepared for it through the diversification of our supply sources and through the maximum replenishment of our stocks. Vitaliy Kim, the head of the Mykolayiv regional military administration, said today there has been heavy fighting in the south of the country. In a video posted on Twitter, Kim said military aid for drones and cars had decreased and urged volunteers to “put in the work again” to help get more equipment because the “Kherson liberation is not far off”. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv today, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured. Kharkiv is the country’s second-largest city and was the subject of fierce attacks in the early stages of the war. European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said today. Reuters reports that Borrell said: The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission. His comments in Prague come hours before talks are set to take place in the city between foreign ministers to discuss a variety of issues, including a possible EU visa ban for Russian tourists. Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in its war with Ukraine, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it is likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. “We assess that Russia intends to use these Iranian UAVs, which can conduct air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare, and targeting, on the battlefield in Ukraine,” the official said. In July, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the US has information that shows Iran is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred drones. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv: The long-awaited counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops appears to have started in the southern region of Kherson, with the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee.” Ukrainian troops have broken through Russian defences in several areas of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video interview Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. But he cautioned Ukrainians against expecting a quick win in the south.

Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russian-installed authorities in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar accused Ukrainian troops today of once again shelling the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s Tass news agency said. The city authorities said two shells exploded near a spent fuel storage building at the plant, Reuters reports. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of attacking Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. It is set to be visited this week by a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. It is 9am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added in a Monday evening address: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych described the counteroffensive as a “planned slow operation to grind the enemy”. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: “We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson. The operation began with heavy shelling of Russian positions and the rear, forcing them to flee, the source was quoted as saying. Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes also continue to disrupt Russian resupply. A Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region without water or power, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority told Russia’s RIA news agency. The town lies just to the east of the city of Kherson. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also appeared to confirm the reports on his Telegram channel alongside a video of firefighters dousing burning cars. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million servicemen, starting January next year. Ukrainian officials have warned politicians, experts and opinion leaders not to speculate about the progress of a military counteroffensive. Spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said the operation in Kherson needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added it was necessary to wait for official statements from Ukraine’s ministry of defence and army. “I understand our wishes and dreams … But war is not ‘content’. Let’s filter information and work professionally out of respect for our defenders,” he wrote on Telegram. Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych has given more details on the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: Today began an active part of the liberation of the south from the Russian invaders. This is a planned slow operation to grind the enemy, saving the lives of our military and civilians. Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour. But we don’t fight like that. Yes, funds are limited. We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Russia is reportedly struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million servicemen, starting January next year. After experiencing significant setbacks and heavy troop losses in six months after invading Ukraine, the Pentagon believes that “this effort is unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel and strength targets,” the official said. The Pentagon’s conclusion is that any more recruits added may not effectively expand overall combat power by the end of the year, according to the official. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, according to British intelligence. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply; however, it is not yet possible to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. The full report reads: Since the start of August, Russia has made significant efforts to reinforce its force on the western bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. The Southern Military District’s (SMD) 49th Combined Arms Army has highly likely been augmented with components of the Eastern Military District’s (EMD) 35th Combined Arms Army. Most of the units around Kherson are likely under-manned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines by ferry and pontoon bridges across the Dnipro. This integration of SMD and EMD units suggests a significant reorganisation of Russia’s force in Ukraine. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has moved to rationalise the several, semi-independent, operational commands which contributed to its poor performance early in the invasion. If Ukraine succeeds in undertaking sustained offensive operations, the cohesion of this untested structure will likely be a key factor in the sustainability of Russian defences in the south.” A team of experts assembled by the UN nuclear watchdog will inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine from Wednesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team arrived in Kyiv on Monday night. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog have arrived in Kyiv en route to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged a new Ukrainian offensive had been launched in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions but said it had failed and the Ukrainians had suffered significant casualties, RIA news agency reported. The “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably,” it said. However, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority later told the outlet that a Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka just east of the city of Kherson without water or power. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. Kyiv’s forces have reportedly broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy has claimed. “I should note today the (Russian) defences were broken through in a few hours,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video interview on Youtube. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said Ukraine’s forces had struck more than 10 sites in the past week and “unquestionably weakened the enemy” during a Monday briefing. Humenyuk declined to give details, saying Russian forces in the south remained “quite powerful” and that the operation needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Her claims could not be independently corroborated. Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to the regional governor told Ukraine’s Pryamyi TV channel on Monday: Today there was a powerful artillery attack on enemy positions in ... the entire territory of the occupied Kherson region. This is the announcement of what we have been waiting for since the spring - it is the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region.” “What is happening now is a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive,” Khlan told Agence France-Presse. A seperate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not address the counteroffensive specifically during his Monday evening address but said: If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Those who surrendered would be treated under the Geneva conventions, he said, adding: “If they do not listen to me, they will deal with our defenders, who will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine.” “Ukraine is returning its own. It will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea … This will happen.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Moscow welcomes a visit by the UN nuclear watchdog to the Zaporizhzhia plant, a top Russian diplomat said. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was not considering the possibility of creating a demilitarised zone at the plant.

Russia’s FSB security service has accused another Ukrainian of being part of a team that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing. Ukraine has denied involvement in the murder of Dugina. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. Two people have been killed after Russian shelling hit residential areas of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, city officials and witnesses said. A woman has died after the strike hit a family home directly next to a school, a Reuters correspondent reported. Both houses on the property were left in ruins, with large craters gouged out of the ground in front. The owner of the home, Olexandr Shulga, said he grew up in the home and had lived there his entire life. His wife died at the scene, Shulga said. Police, military officials and Ukrainian war crimes prosecutors were at the site in a residential neighbourhood of Mykolaiv. Russia’s defence ministry has responded to Ukraine’s claims that its troops have launched a long-awaited counter-offensive in the south of the country. Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cites the ministry as saying that Ukraine’s troops attempted an offensive in southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, sustaining significant casualties. The ministry added: Enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably. It is not possible to verify these claims. Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has said a “long-awaited” Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces is underway in the south of the country to retake Moscow-controlled territory. Speaking to CNN, Poroshenko said: This is the long-awaited counteroffensive operation. It was started today at 7:00 a.m. (local time) with shelling and missiles attack. He added: This is first time since February 2022 when such a [concentration] of Ukrainian troops with western artillery, with western HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) and western missiles was collected together for this counterattack. It is not possible to independently verify his claims. The EU plans to make it harder for Russians to travel to the bloc by suspending a deal that eases their visa applications, according to reports. AFP cites an EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Prague, as saying: We cannot continue the visa policy as it has been up to now. Tourism “is not a human right”, the diplomat added. The bloc has already suspended visa facilitation for Russian official delegations and business leaders. The new measure, which if approved could come into force in October, does not amount to a formal ban on tourism visas but would complicate the process. Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have urged Brussels to ban Russian tourists from obtaining visas for the EU’s Schengen common travel area. The issue will be debated at a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers starting tomorrow. The source said he expected a “robust debate” at the meeting but said a full visa ban would have to be part of a new sanctions package and receive the unanimous backing of member states. A team from the UN nuclear watchdog due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine has left Vienna, the Ukrainian foreign ministry has said. The mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to arrive in Kyiv today, the ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. He added: It is expected that the mission will start work at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the coming days. Russia’s FSB security service has accused without evidence a second Ukrainian citizen of preparing the car bomb that killed the daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue this month. The FSB had previously claimed Ukrainian intelligence plotted the murder of Darya Dugina, a pro-war pundit who was killed when a bomb tore through the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving near Moscow after a conservative festival. Ukraine has strenuously denied any connection to the killing, with a government spokesperson saying that “we are not a criminal state, unlike Russia, and definitely not a terrorist state”. Dugina was the daughter of the political philosopher Alexander Dugin, a radical voice on foreign policy who has called for conflict with the west and told Russians they should “kill, kill, kill” Ukrainians. On Monday, Russia alleged that a member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” acquired fake documents and helped to assemble the car bomb in a garage in southern Moscow. The agency released video of the person it said was the suspect, but it did not publish any evidence that showed he had been involved in the killing. The agency’s claims could not be independently verified by the Guardian. Read the full article by my colleague Andrew Roth here. Here’s more on the reports that Russian shelling of private homes in Mykolaiv earlier today left several people dead, according to the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim. Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych, said at least two civilians were killed and five others were injured after shelling by Russian forces on residential buildings and educational institutions. Writing on Telegram, Sienkevych said: Russian bastards follow their rules and cynically shell civilians. Mykolaiv. Information as of 16:30. Residential buildings and educational institutions were hit. It is currently known about two killed and five injured. It has not been possible to independently verify this information.

Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Nadiia Vorobei is giving a tour of her ruined, green-walled home on a rainy afternoon in the village of Andriivka, 30 miles west of Kyiv. The 66-year-old says that in March she was “literally carried out of the house” by Russian soldiers so they could forcibly billet themselves within it. Two weeks later, on 18 March, the property was devastated in the fighting. She says it burned out in 20 minutes after an explosion while she looked on from her neighbours’ house next door. The destruction of the home her parents had built was painful to watch, she says. Since then, Vorobei says, she has had no help from Ukraine’s authorities. A couple of friends are trying to rebuild her garage in time for winter, but she has no money to pay for further help. Her pension is 2,500 hryvnia (about £57) a month, enough to cover basic living costs and no more. Volunteers donated a small shipping container in April, where Vorobei lives at the rear of the property. It is tiny, the length of a single bed, with chipboard walls and electricity but no water or gas. Possessions are piled high in the little space available. “I call it a doghouse,” she says. Five months after the Russians were forced out of the towns and villages north-west of Kyiv, it is clear that reconstruction and recovery is at best slow and at worst nonexistent. Read the full story by Dan Sabbagh and Artem Mazhulin: ‘I call it the doghouse’: slow progress on rebuilding ruined homes near Kyiv Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of economic terrorism as the cost of Europe’s energy crisis spiralled, Reuters reported. “Russia is using economic terror,” Zelenskiy told an energy industry conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger. “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” Zelenskiy told the audience via a translator. Another multinational has announced its intentions to wind down its remaining operations in Russia, Reuters has reported. Computer accessories giant Logitech International said on Monday it would wind down its remaining operations in Russia due to the “ongoing uncertain environment”, joining other major technology and telecoms businesses to announce plans for a complete exit. “In March, we communicated that Logitech would stop shipments to Russia,” Logitech said in a statement. “We have monitored the situation closely and regrettably, the circumstances do not allow for us to continue to do business as before.” A number of civilians have been killed after Russian shelling of private homes in Mykolaiv, according to the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim. Writing on Telegram, Kim said: The centre of the city is being heavily shelled. There are still rockets being launched. Do not leave shelters. Powerful explosions have been reported today in Mykolaiv. as well as in the Russian-occupied Kherson, with residents urged to stay in shelters. The Guardian has not been able to verify the regional governor’s report. Here’s more on the reports that Ukraine’s forces have started a long-awaited counter-offensive in the country’s south. The US believes that Kyiv’s troops have begun “shaping” operations in the south of the country to prepare for a significant Ukrainian counter-offensive, CNN reports. According to two senior US officials, the US believes the counter-offensive will include a combination of air and ground operations. Shaping operations are standard military practice prior to an offensive, and usually involve striking weapons systems, command and control, ammunition depots and other targets to prepare the battlefield for planned advances. Ukraine has started a long-awaited counter-offensive in the country’s south, its southern military command has announced, amid reports that Ukrainian troops were able to break through Russian lines in the Kherson region. Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, was cited by Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne as saying: Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. More than 10 Russian ammunition dumps had been hit over the last week, Humeniuk added. Humeniuk’s comments came after reports from Ukrainian newspapers that units of Ukraine’s defence forces had last night launched a counteroffensive on the right bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson Oblast. Soldiers deployed on the front lines have reportedly said they managed to break through the first line of Russian defence in the region. The Guardian has not been able to verify these reports. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned that the UN nuclear watchdog’s mission to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine will be the “hardest in the history” of the agency. Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”, Kuleba said during a visit to Stockholm. Kuleba said: This mission will be the hardest in the history of the IAEA, given the active combat activities undertaken by the Russian Federation on the ground and also the very blatant way that Russia is trying to legitimise its presence. He also demanded Russia leave the nuclear plant, adding: Russia must go and the IAEA as well as many countries of the world, we have to make them go, it’s as simple as that. This is the only way to ensure nuclear security. Moscow has said it welcomes a visit by the UN nuclear watchdog to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed earlier today that it would inspect the Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s largest nuclear plant – this week and that a team was en route to the facility. The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities, it said. A top Russian diplomat said Moscow hoped the IAEA visit would dispel misconceptions about the plant’s allegedly poor state, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent representative to the international organisations in Vienna, was quoted by Ria as saying that his country had worked hard to help make the visit possible and understood that the IAEA wanted to leave several representatives at the plant on a permanent basis. Ulyanov was cited as saying: As far as we understand, it is the director general’s intention to leave several people at the station on a permanent basis. He added: Russia has made a significant contribution to the preparation of this mission. We hope that the visit of the plant by the IAEA mission will dispel numerous speculations about the unfavorable state of affairs at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of “exposing the European continent to danger” ahead of the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow welcomed the upcoming mission and was ready to cooperate with the IAEA. But he added that Russia was not considering the possibility of creating a demilitarised zone at the plant. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling in the plant’s vicinity in recent weeks, while denying the claims themselves. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you may have missed: The UN nuclear watchdog will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this week, its director general has said. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, tweeted confirmation of the visit early on Monday. The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu is being “sidelined” due to problems in the war against Ukraine and is likely being ridiculed by soldiers for his “ineffectual” leadership, said British intelligence. The latest update from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) that Shoigu has probably “struggled” to overcome his reputation as not having much military experience. Russia’s FSB security service today named another Ukrainian it said was part of a team that assassinated Darya Dugina. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow on 20 August. Two days after the 29-year-old’s murder, the FSB said it had solved the case, naming a Ukrainian woman it said had trailed Dugina for weeks, rented an apartment in her housing complex and planted the car bomb before fleeing Russia to Estonia - all with Kyiv’s backing. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing, reports Reuters. Ericsson said it will gradually wind down business activities in Russia over the coming months. The company, which suspended its business in Russia indefinitely in April, said it has about 400 employees in Russia and would provide financial support to affected employees, reports Reuters. Dell Technologies Inc said on Saturday it had ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has admitted the body of a New Zealand soldier who died defending Ukraine may never be returned home. Corporal Dominic Abelen, 28, was on leave without pay when he travelled to Ukraine to fight in the war against defence force rules and without telling his family. Foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta has stressed New Zealand is treating the case of Abelen as a citizen rather than a soldier, though there are calls to bring Abelen’s remains home. Ardern said questions of how to treat Abelen were secondary to practical ones during a string of radio and media appearances on Monday morning. European Union defence and foreign ministers will meet in Prague this week to discuss options for setting up a military training mission for Ukrainian forces and also look into calls by some members to ban Russian tourists from entering the bloc, reports Reuters. The bloc’s foreign policy and security chief, Josep Borrell, has given few details of his plans so far, merely stating such a military training programme would not be based in Ukraine but in neighbouring countries. In meetings on Monday and Tuesday this week, officials will also discuss a proposed visa ban for Russians. Russian forces are “reconstructing” the Mariupol theatre to cover war crimes, according to an adviser to the city’s mayor. Petr Andriushchenko said Moscow’s forces are rebuilding the theatre under the guise of reconstruction for “historical value”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said. The meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, local officials said on Sunday. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia and the town of Orikhiv farther east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Russia did so in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” said a US state department statement. Concern about the potential risk of radiation leaks at the plant persists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities issued fresh warnings about the risk of radioactive leaks, after shelling that the sides blamed on each other. Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances”. Russia has ignored widespread international calls for the area to be demilitarised. Ukrainians are likely to experience their coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17-18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. Germany is replenishing its gas stocks more quickly than expected despite drastic Russian supply cuts and should meet an October target early, the government has said. Europe’s largest economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has raced to bolster its reserves before winter, crediting energy-saving measures in recent weeks and massive purchases of gas from other suppliers. EU foreign ministers are expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation next week. The EU move falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban would lack the necessary support. “I don’t think that to cut the relationship with the Russian civilian population will help and I don’t think that this idea will have the required unanimity,” he told Austria’s ORF TV on Sunday. Russia’s FSB security service today named another Ukrainian it said was part of a team that assassinated Darya Dugina. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow on 20 August. Two days after the 29-year-old’s murder, the FSB said it had solved the case, naming a Ukrainian woman it said had trailed Dugina for weeks, rented an apartment in her housing complex and planted the car bomb before fleeing Russia to Estonia – all with Kyiv’s backing. Ukraine has denied involvement in the murder of Dugina. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing, reports Reuters. It said in a statement that the new suspect, a man born in 1978 who it named and showed CCTV footage of, had helped assemble the car bomb in a rented garage in Moscow and had secured fake documents and number plates for the woman who had planted the bomb on Dugina’s car. The man had exited Russia via Estonia a day before the attack, it said. In an 11-minute video released by the FSB, CCTV footage showed the man entering Russia on 30 July, entering and exiting a garage complex in Moscow, collecting what the FSB said were fake number plates, and exiting Russia in the early hours of 19 August, the day before Dugina was killed. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu is being “sidelined” due to problems in the war against Ukraine and is likely being ridiculed by soldiers for his “ineffectual” leadership, said British intelligence. The latest update from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: Recent independent Russian media reports have claimed that due to the problems Russia is facing in its war against Ukraine, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu is now being sidelined within the Russian leadership, with operational commanders briefing President Putin directly on the course of the war. Russian officers and soldiers with first-hand experience of the war probably routinely ridicule Shoigu for his ineffectual and out-of-touch leadership as Russian progress has stalled. The update added that Shoigu has probably “struggled” to overcome his reputation as not having much military experience. Ericsson said today it will gradually wind down business activities in Russia over the coming months. The company, which suspended its business in Russia indefinitely in April, said it had about 400 employees in Russia and would provide financial support to affected employees, reports Reuters. A number of western companies are selling their Russian businesses after announcing suspensions of operations in the weeks after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February. Dell Technologies Inc said on Saturday it had ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August. Its Finnish rival Nokia had already announced its decision to pull out of Russia, impacting about 2,000 employees. The Finnish company did not respond to a request for comment on when the exit will complete. The G7 today welcomed a trip by the UN nuclear watchdog to Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and reiterated concerns about the safety of the plant under the control of Russian armed forces. In a statement reported by Reuters, it said: We reaffirm that the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and the electricity that it produces rightly belong to Ukraine and stress that attempts by Russia to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid would be unacceptable. As we reported earlier a team from the UN nuclear watchdog said it was on its way to the plant that was captured by Russian troops in March but run by Ukrainian staff, and will reach it later this week. ‘There were a lot of mines around [the pitch]’, says the former captain of Obolon Kyiv’s second team. ‘Even now we are still afraid to kick the ball over the fence.’ Kostja Kovalenko describes the reality of life at the team’s training ground before their first match in Ukraine’s second tier, as the Guardian visits the outskirts of Bucha, a war-torn suburb of the capital. Reuters reports that in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Russian forces shelled military and civilian infrastructure near Bakhmut, Shumy, Yakovlivka, Zaytsevo, and Kodema, Ukraine’s military said early today. Russian strikes killed eight civilians in Donetsk province on Sunday, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Russia denies targeting civilians. Isobel Koshiw for us from Kyiv: Ukrainians are likely to experience the coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17 and 18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. “Heating season”, the period when the central heating is on, will come later and end earlier, said Vitrenko. The target depends on Ukraine’s international allies giving it the necessary funds to import 4bn cubic metres worth of gas, as well as no wildcards playing out – such as Russia destroying gas infrastructure or further decreasing its gas supplies to Europe.

The bloc’s foreign policy and security chief, Josep Borrell, has given few details of his plans so far, merely stating such a military training programme would not be based in Ukraine but in neighbouring countries. In meetings on Monday and Tuesday this week, officials will also discuss a proposed visa ban for Russians. The Czechs, who currently hold the EU’s rotating presidency, are pushing for an EU-wide ban on visas for Russian tourists, an idea supported mainly by the Baltic countries. However, Germany, some other member states and Borrell reject such a move, arguing it might breach EU rules and cut off escape routes for Russian dissidents. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, has said Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland, which all share a border with Russia, may act on their own to block tourists if the EU does not agree on a union-wide ban. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the west earlier this month to impose a blanket travel ban on Russians, drawing an angry rebuke from Moscow. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has admitted the body of a New Zealand soldier who died defending Ukraine may never be returned home. Corporal Dominic Abelen, 28, was on leave without pay when he travelled to Ukraine to fight in the war against defence force rules and without telling his family. Foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta has stressed New Zealand is treating the case of Abelen as a citizen rather than a soldier, though there are calls to bring Abelen’s remains home. Ardern said questions of how to treat Abelen were secondary to practical ones during a string of radio and media appearances on Monday morning. The issue is whether or not we’re even going to have that ability (to access Ukraine) ... it is a war zone. We do not have people on the ground. We do not have consular support on the ground. It’s very difficult for us to to do much at this present point in time. That does not mean however that we are not seeking as much information as possible and trying to understand the circumstances.” Ardern declined to answer questions around the matter, including where Abelen died, where his body is, whether they know where the body is, and if it is in Russian hands. Local media reports suggest Abelen died while attempting to re-take a series of trenches in the eastern Donbas region. Ardern did say Abelen’s family were being briefed, saying “they have as much information as we have”. Russian forces are “reconstructing” the Mariupol theatre to cover war crimes, according to an advisor to the city’s mayor. Petr Andriushchenko said Moscow’s forces are rebuilding the theatre under the guise of reconstruction for “historical value”. The occupiers are hiding their own war crime … They are in a hurry to eliminate all traces and evidence through ‘reconstruction’. Under the guise of ‘historical value’. … The only historical value arose when two bombs fell. And it is this historical value that the occupiers are now trying to hide.” Russian forces struck the theatre back in March, killing an estimated 300 people who were using the building for refuge. Russia is increasing mobilisation reserves and plans to mobilise about 90,000 military personnel, according to Ukrainian intelligence. The representative of the main directorate of intelligence of the ministry of defence of Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, said in a statement on Sunday: At the same time, different approaches are used: so-called volunteer battalions, and reserve battalions, battalions of the so-called ‘combat army reserve of the country’ (BARS), which they are now recruiting in each military district in order to replenish losses, increase their efforts, and to increase the number of the very group that can be used against our state.” According to Skibitsky, Russia is having significant problems in equipping its armed forces. Time is running out, they did not receive a blitzkrieg. Will the mobilisation of more people in the Russian Federation help? Probably not, after all. Because the morale of military personnel, as they conduct combat operations, decreases, firstly. Secondly, there are fewer and fewer willing to enter the ranks of the Soviet Union on a voluntary basis. In addition, panic has begun among the population of large cities, because no one wants to simply go to serve in the armed forces, let alone go to war.” Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Russian forces are shelling the residential quarters of the city. Cars and houses of civilians are burning,” the military said alongside footage purportedly from the attack published to its official Telegram account In the footage multiple cars can be seen engulfed in flames as firefighters rush to extinguish the blaze. The chief of staff of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also appeared to confirm the reports late on Sunday on his Telegram channel alongside a video of fire fighters dousing burning cars. “They provoke and try to blackmail the world,” chief of staff Andriy Yermak said. Russian forces have pounded Ukrainian towns across the river from the plant over recent days, officials have said. Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram on Sunday that Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia, about a two-hour drive from the plant, and the town of Orikhiv further east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnipro river, while the Russian state news agency cited authorities as saying they had downed a Ukrainian drone which planned to attack the nuclear-waste storage facility at the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this week, its director general has confirmed. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, tweeted early this morning: The day has come, the IAEA’s support and assistance mission to Zaporizhzhia (ISAMZ) is now on its way. We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility. Proud to lead this mission which will be in ZNPP later this week.” The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said “the day has come” for a support mission to protect the safety and security of Europe’s largest nuclear facility and officials will visit the site “later this week.” Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the plant is located, late on Sunday night, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. The strike comes after Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. It is 8am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said.

Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. The Energoatom head, Petro Kotin, told the Guardian a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

The day-ahead price for power for delivery on Monday reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange. The price for power at 5-6pm, typically around the time of peak power demand each day, passed an all-time high of £2,586 a megawatt-hour. Prices are surging as the weather forces Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy, despite high bills. Snow and ice have caused disruption as the cold weather looks set to continue into this week, with snow forecast for parts of east and south-east England, as well as Scotland. The cold snap, which is expected to last for at least a week, comes as wind speeds reduced sharply, hitting power suppliers. Live data from the National Grid’s Electricity System Operator showed that wind power was providing just 3% of Great Britain’s electricity generation on Sunday. Gas-fired power stations provided 59%, while nuclear power and electricity imports both accounted for about 15%. The increase in power prices come amid jitters over energy supplies this winter. National Grid warned in October that a combination of factors such as a cold spell and a shortage of gas in Europe related to the war in Ukraine could lead to power cuts in the UK. The anticipated surge in power demand on Monday evening will coincide with a planned use of the National Grid’s demand flexibility service between 5pm and 7pm. The scheme pays businesses and households to cut their consumption at peak times to reduce the strain on the grid. The scheme has been used several times as part of a series of tests but is yet to be used as a result of electricity supply shortages. National Grid flirted with using it under these circumstances last month but did not do so. Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine at UK Health Security Agency, encouraged those with health conditions to heat their homes to a comfortable temperature. “In rooms you mostly use such as the living room or bedroom, try to heat them to at least 18C if you can. Keep your bedroom windows closed at night. Wearing several layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thicker layer,” he said. German day-ahead power prices rose 33% to €434 (£373) a megawatt-hour, the highest since 13 September, while the French contract rose 40% to €465 a megawatt-hour, Bloomberg reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T01:23:34Z","webTitle":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","fields":{"headline":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An enthusiastic Rishi Sunak has told ministers to expect a positive outcome next week when he travels to San Diego to unveil a deal to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the Aukus pact with the US. Multiple sources said they believed the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia, a deal that will safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness. A senior minister said Sunak had told colleagues he was delighted by the outcome of the negotiations, which have been going on for 18 months and have presented Australia with a choice between a British or a US design, based on the existing Astute or Virginia class submarines. “The deal has definitely gone our way. The prime minister was buzzing about it when he told ministers, smiling and bouncing on the balls of his feet,” the minister said. A second source outside government with knowledge of the talks said they had also been told to expect a British design success when the deal is announced on Monday, although any final submarine will also make heavy use of US technology. Sunak is due to travel to the west coast for a trilateral summit with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, on Monday, where he also expected to unveil a refresh of Britain’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy in the light of the war in Ukraine. Supplying Australia with a nuclear-powered submarine was the centrepiece for the Aukus defence pact, announced in September 2021, with the US and UK agreeing to share secret reactor technology in a surprise deal, so Canberra could dump an alternative diesel-powered design from France. The expectation, one source indicated, was that Australia would work jointly on a design for a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design, although it may not be seaworthy until the 2040s because of the complexity of the work. Further reports last night suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US as part of the three-way deal. Meanwhile, an alternative plan that the UK could even be willing to sell or lease the two Astute class submarines yet to be completed at Barrow, HMS Agincourt and HMS Agamemnon, is wide of the mark. Naval analysts say the UK’s submarine fleet is already stretched and could not afford a sudden reduction. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor, propulsion technology that will put the country’s diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut” according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. The new submarines will not carry nuclear weapons. But James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was not yet clear how the nuclear waste generated by the propulsion reactors will be dealt with – and whether that will happen in Australia or the UK or US. Defence experts said the time it would take to build the new submarines meant that there may be some related short-term developments. The US is keen to be able to base its nuclear submarines in Australia, making it easier to patrol the South Pacific, as it seeks to retain naval parity with China. A UK government spokesperson said: “When we announced the Aukus partnership in September 2021 we said there would be an 18-month scoping period to determine the optimal path to procuring Australia nuclear-powered submarines. The outcome of the scoping period is due to be announced soon.” A No 10 spokesperson said they could not pre-empt any future announcements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:06:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 177 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 177 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rescuers are searching for survivors and victims under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, according to reports. Local head of police Volodymyr Tymoshko said 19 people are confirmed dead, including a child, and 20 injured, with the death toll expected to rise after Russian rockets struck two hostel dormitories. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. The summit, initiated by Ukraine, will be available to watch live on Nato’s website. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases, after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. According to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats, The Kyiv Independent reports. There were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine” on Thursday for the first time since 6 July, a report by The Institute for the Study of War, has found. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia has failed to make ground in the cyberspace battle against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come.

It certainly is from the UAE. We in the UAE are not shying away from the energy transition. We are running towards it.” Al Jaber is also chief executive of the UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, which has brought him under heavy fire from climate activists. Many prominent climate campaigning groups, and politicians including several US lawmakers, have called for him to step down from the oil company role. But Al Jaber told the World Government Summit, an annual meeting organised by the UAE in Dubai, that the country was working to “transform entire industrial systems that still run on the energies of the first Industrial Revolution”. He set out the case for the UAE’s presidency of the Cop28 summit, the fortnight-long meeting of heads of state and government that will begin on 30 November. At the conference, governments will be expected to report on how much progress they have made on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the commitments of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. This “global stocktake” is expected to show that far too little has been done to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the key aspiration set at Paris, and which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Al Jaber said on Tuesday: “We don’t need to wait for the stocktake to find out what it will say. We already know that we are way off track. The world is playing catch-up when it comes to holding global temperatures down to 1.5C.” He called for much stronger action around the world. “We need to triple renewable energy capacity, double hydrogen production, expand nuclear power, improve battery storage and, if we are serious about capturing emissions, scale up carbon capture technologies. All while minimising the carbon intensity of the energy we use today,” he said. Investors must come forward with “lots of capital” to achieve these goals, Al Jaber said. “We need to ramp up investment across every area of decarbonisation and we should view these investments as an opportunity, not a burden,” he said. “In fact, economists estimate that decarbonising industry, the energy sector, power generation, transportation and food systems could create an additional $12tn in economic value by 2030.” In an implicit defence of his dual role, he added: “We have an unprecedented opportunity to engage the energy industry in a technological revolution that gets us to a climate-positive future. And yes, it is in our common interest to have the energy industry working hand in hand, and alongside everyone on the solutions that the world needs. That is just logical and makes sense.” Adnoc has benefited from the global oil and gas bonanza of the past year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company’s drilling subsidiary, Adnoc Drilling, reported profits this week up by a third on last year. The company plans an expansion of its oil and gas production, which climate campaigners said ran counter to the Cop28 goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Marta Schaaf, the director of climate, economic and social justice at Amnesty International, said: “Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of Adnoc, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, plans to increase the group’s production of fossil fuels – this is entirely incompatible with his role as president designate of Cop28. [He] cannot be an honest broker for climate talks when the company he leads is planning to cause more climate damage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T15:38:30Z","webTitle":"Uranium was embedded in metal bars seized at Heathrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","fields":{"headline":"Uranium was embedded in metal bars seized at Heathrow","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A discovery of metal bars embedded with uranium at Heathrow in late December has triggered an urgent counter-terrorism investigation, in an attempt to establish why it was concealed in an aeroplane shipment. Scotland Yard said on Tuesday night the amount of contaminated material was “extremely small” and posed “no threat to the public” although some reports had suggested, incorrectly, that several kilograms of uranium itself were discovered. The absence of danger was emphasised by multiple sources on Wednesday morning, although the way in which the uranium was discovered “in kilo bars” has raised questions whether there was a deliberate effort to conceal the presence of the radioactive element. Found by Border Force staff at Heathrow airport, the uranium was contained in a package of scrap metal that originally came from Pakistan and had come to the UK via a passenger flight from Oman on 29 December. It was bound for an Iranian business with premises in the UK. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former head of the British army’s chemical weapons unit, said he believed only trace amounts of uranium had been discovered and that it was unclear – “a million-dollar question” – what it could have been for. But the weapons expert said the public should not be concerned, not least because it was detected once it had arrived in the UK. “The system worked,” he added. Iran has been enriching uranium to 60% at two sites in the country, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but denies any plan to develop a bomb, which requires uranium to be 90% enriched. Tehran also remains in long-running talks to restart an agreement in which it would curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief, but concerns about the country’s support for Russia make it unclear if a deal can be struck. Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power stations and can be used for “dirty bombs” – munitions with a radioactive element – and certain types of nuclear weapons. But the Metropolitan police said its discovery did not appear to be linked with any active plot. “I want to reassure the public that the amount of contaminated material was extremely small and has been assessed by experts as posing no threat to the public,” said Commander Richard Smith of the Met. “Although our investigation remains ongoing, from our inquiries so far it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat. As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of inquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.” A Met spokesperson added: “We can confirm officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command were contacted by Border Force colleagues at Heathrow after a very small amount of contaminated material was identified after routine screening within a package incoming to the UK on 29 December 2022.” It is understood that the Home Office does not believe there is any threat to the public. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on live investigations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T10:40:13Z","webTitle":"UK’s nuclear waste cleanup operation could cost £260bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"UK’s nuclear waste cleanup operation could cost £260bn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s 20th-century nuclear waste could rise to £260bn as the aged and degrading sites present growing challenges, according to analysis presented to an international group of experts. As the government pursues nuclear energy with the promise of a new generation of reactors, the cost of safely cleaning up waste from previous generations of power stations is soaring. Degrading nuclear facilities are presenting increasingly hazardous and challenging problems. Ageing equipment and electrical systems at Sellafield, which is storing much of the country’s nuclear waste and is one of the most hazardous sites in the world, are increasing the risk of fire, according to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. They require increasing maintenance and present growing risk. Last October a faulty light fitting started a blaze at a Sellafield facility which led to its closure for several weeks. Analysis by Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, estimates the total bill for decommissioning the UK’s nuclear waste mountain will grow to £260bn. Thomas told a conference of international experts the cost of decommissioning Sellafield had risen from to £110bn, according to freedom of information requests. Other sites that need decommissioning are the 11 Magnox power stations, built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built from the 1960s to the 1980s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Deterioration of one of the Magnox stations, Trawsfynydd, which shut down in 1991, is such that substantial work is needed to make it safe, according to the NDA. “Work that would then need to be undone to complete reactor dismantling,” the agency said. Thomas told the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group similar problems are expected at other Magnox sites. The timetable for decommissioning the old nuclear power stations has been abandoned, with no new timescale yet published. The Nuclear Waste Service has said deferring decommissioning for 85 years from shutdown, which was previous policy, is not suitable for all the reactors because of their different ages and physical conditions. Decommissioning of some Magnox stations will have to be brought forward, the NWS has said. Attempts to speed up the decommissioning would only add to the growing bill, Thomas said, which he estimated had increased to £34bn. In 2005, the cost for decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 70s and 90s was put at £51bn. Last year the NDA estimates rose to £131bn, and its latest annual report said £149bn was needed to pay for the clear up. But Thomas said rising costs meant the total bill was on track to reach £260bn. Part of the soaring increase is the cost of building a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 double decker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme. The mammoth engineering project was initially predicted to cost £11bn but the bill is now estimated to be up to £53bn because of uncertainty about where the site will be located, and the need to provide space for an unspecified amount of waste from the new generation of nuclear reactors which the government wants to build. Four areas of the country are being considered for the GDF but no decision on where it will be located has yet been made. “While we are clear about the current legacy of waste which already exists, a GDF would have to handle additional waste from new facilities being developed,” the NWService said. “The actual cost will … depend on the number of new nuclear projects that the UK develops in future and any additional waste from those stations.” The cleanup of past nuclear waste will take more than 100 years, the NDA has said. Highlighting the challenges of the degrading and hazardous facilities, the authority said in its annual report that robots and drones were increasingly being used to carry out site inspections. • This article was amended on 28 September 2022. The UK’s seven advanced gas-cooled reactors were built from the 1960s to the 1980s, not “in the 1990s” as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/20/life-ukraine-putin-genocide-bombs-dam-kherson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-20T07:00:34Z","webTitle":"Others debate whether Putin’s attack on Ukraine is genocide.

As bombs rain down on us, I have no doubt","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The 468th day of the invasion. Downtown Kyiv. 2am. Over the past 35 days, my wife, Olena, and I have discovered a new way to sleep. Our bodies have become so accustomed to constant night-time air-raid alerts that now we balance on the edge of a deep sleep, which guarantees at least a little rest, and employ special listening techniques throughout the night. The whole body morphs into one big ear. And in a moment, the sound of an approaching rocket will pull us from a heavy slumber. We don’t need words. As usual, we jump out of bed and in a few leaps fly from the bedroom to the corridor. The two-wall rule creates an illusion of safety. No walls could save us from a direct hit by an Iranian Shahed drone or a Russian missile. However, there is a placebo impression, that at least it will protect us against the blast wave and glass fragments. Our dog, Lisa, is already hiding in the corridor. This month, she began to spend more time under the chairs and the dinner table, and in a new spot – at the front door. She is looking for a safe place, which cannot be found in this city. In May 2023, 32 air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv; 23 of them during the night. The air defence forces shot down 85 missiles and 169 drones that were aimed at our city. I simply stopped counting the number of rattling Shaheds that Olena and I heard above us. Just like the earlier blackouts, when the Russians shelled Ukrainian infrastructure and terrorised the civilian population, new habits are being formed. For every genocidal action, a new defence mechanism is developed. Night-time shelling results in slowed-down reactions and a feeling of chronic fatigue. The response to loud sounds is exaggerated. We deal with the night-time stress from explosions by consuming something sweet. The resistance of mind is such that business communications and chat messages are now coming through, unceasing, to a nightly soundtrack of explosions. Life does not stop during the genocide. However, life’s stream is being broken. The Russian occupying troops blew up the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. The scale of the disaster is unimaginable, and the consequences are impossible to estimate. Ecosystems have been destroyed. The global economy has taken a hit, and the hope for at least some harvest has been called into question. The unstoppable, wild water has already inundated dozens of settlements, and 16,000 local residents are under direct threat. Temporarily occupied Crimea might be left without a fresh-water supply. There is a threat of collapse at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as it is being cooled down with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. The flood hides the traces of Russian war crimes and mass graves within the occupied territories of Kherson region. What was behind the thinking of the Russian troops, other than a panicky attempt to somehow stop the possibility of a Ukrainian counteroffensive? The concept of the future as such does not exist in the mindset of Putin’s Russia. Like any totalitarian regime, it is fuelled by resentment and relentless promises of a return to the golden age, which Russian fascists see as some kind of hybrid between the USSR and the Russian empire. The Russian occupying forces have no strategy, only tactics based on two concepts. The first one is untranslatable into any language of the world: авось (“avos”). “To take a risk in the hope that it will somehow work out”, “an unmotivated desire to get a favourable coincidence of circumstances, to get lucky”. Everything is based on this “just maybe somehow” – the idea of the full-scale invasion, the defence of Russian borders and holding on to occupied territories. Just maybe, it will work out somehow. The second basis of their actions is a methodical, everyday genocide. If there is no future for them, why should we have one? They kidnap our children. They incinerate nature. They destroy the cities. Vast areas are being mined, and the demining will take decades. They want the whole world to be in awe of them. Russian methods of warfare have been unchanged since Soviet times: human life has no value. It doesn’t matter whether it concerns the enemy or their own peaceful civilians. In 1941, Soviet Chekists blew up the dam of the Dnipro hydroelectric power station, trying to stop the advance of German troops. However, it was not only the enemy who ended up under the waves. According to various estimates, between 20,000 and 100,000 Soviet military personnel and civilians perished at that time. Life does not stop during the genocide. Life is trying to survive. As I write these lines, I still hope that the world community will somehow respond to this human-made disaster, which will soon cause a food crisis, have irreversible consequences for the ecosystem and affect the climate. Instead, the UN celebrates Russian Language Day. The date was not chosen by chance – it’s the birthday of Alexander Pushkin, a 19th-century poet, whose monuments are being dismantled throughout Ukraine as a symbol of Russian colonialism. As I write these lines, my friends in the military, guarding the border in Kharkiv region, are ordered to have gas masks at the ready – a cloud of ammonia is approaching them, because during the night Russian troops damaged a pipeline. As I write these lines, dozens of volunteers are organising caravans of cars to evacuate those who have lost their homes. We are all in the same evacuation ark of this invasion. Genocide is when human-made catastrophes resemble biblical scenes of mass destruction. Everything everywhere all at once. Western colleagues say that it will be almost impossible to classify Russia’s actions as the genocide of Ukrainians. I must reassure you. When genocide comes to your lands, it will be easily recognisable. It’s when everything inside you freezes from what you’ve seen, your knees go weak and you become speechless. It’s when the realisation comes that the evil committed will have irreversible consequences. It’s when the enemy daily changes the landscape of your consciousness, and your psyche – the essence of what you are – is forced to form new reactions, habits and broken patterns of behaviour. It’s when the scale of the catastrophe doesn’t fit in the finite box of your imagination. It’s when it turns out that the previous day’s wrath isn’t sufficient. And you realise you are capable of feeling even stronger rage towards the enemy. This is when all life is fighting for the future. Oleksandr Mykhed is a writer and member of PEN Ukraine.

Photographs published on social media on Thursday showed a Pantsir missile system had been installed on the roof of an eight-story building used by the Russian defence ministry along the Moskva River. Another video showed the air defence system being lifted on to the roof of an education building in Moscow’s Taganka district, 1.5 miles south-east of the Kremlin. The short-to-medium-range systems are used to defend against aircraft, helicopters, and cruise missiles. The Russian military has also said they could be used against smaller targets, such as military and commercial drones, which have become ubiquitous on the battlefield since Vladimir Putin launched his wide-scale invasion in February. Images of the missile systems in Moscow emerged a day before western defence officials were set to meet at Ramstein airbase in Germany to agree on a new military aid package to Ukraine that could include the provision of heavy tanks. The US has already pledged nearly $2bn in further military aid to Ukraine, including a Patriot air sefence system meant to protect Ukrainian cities from Russian missiles. But Russian officials have issued warnings ahead of the meeting, attempting to dissuade Nato countries from providing more advanced weapons by claiming that these could potentially spark a nuclear conflict. “The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the beginning of a nuclear war,” wrote Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, who has become a leading hawk as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. Russian military officials did not immediately confirm the installation of the missile systems. However, several Russian media outlets have also reported on the deployment of long-range S-400 missile systems in Moscow in recent weeks. The S-400 and Pantsir-S1 systems are often used in tandem. The missile systems have appeared in the wake of a Russian bombing campaign that has used missiles and drones to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, leading to scores of deaths across the country. A Russian X-22 anti-ship ballistic missile hit an apartment block in the city of Dnipro last week, killing 45. Pro-Kremlin bloggers on Thursday said that the appearance of the missile systems in Moscow showed that the Russian military leadership was concerned now about attacks on their own cities. “It means that [the leadership] perfectly understand all the risks and understand that strikes against Moscow and the regions are just a question of time,” wrote Alexander Kots, a prominent Russian journalist who supports the Russian war in Ukraine. “It’s good to begin planning in advance instead of after the first strikes.” The appearance of the defensive missile systems highlights Russia’s lack of success in the war. Mysterious explosions have taken place at military sites in Crimea, and at several airbases used by Russian strategic bombers last month deep inside Russian territory. Ukrainian officials have also said they have begun testing long-range drones that can travel up to 1,000 km (621 miles), potentially putting Moscow in striking distance. “Russia has long given a very high priority to maintaining advanced ground-based air defences, but it is increasingly clear that it is struggling to counter air threats deep inside Russia,” the UK defence ministry wrote last year, a day after the explosions at Russia’s Engels airbase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jul/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-expected-to-extend-stoltenberg-term-drones-reportedly-intercepted-in-moscow-region","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T17:50:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: 12 children among 38 people wounded by Russian missile strike – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-expected-to-extend-stoltenberg-term-drones-reportedly-intercepted-in-moscow-region","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jul/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-expected-to-extend-stoltenberg-term-drones-reportedly-intercepted-in-moscow-region","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: 12 children among 38 people wounded by Russian missile strike – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: Ukrainian officials said at least 38 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Television footage from the small town of Pervomaiskyi showed a nine-storey residential building with smashed windows and black smoke pouring out. Mangled cars were in flames nearby, and a man sat in an ambulance with blood over his face, Reuters reported. Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. In an address from the Kremlin to a virtual gathering of leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group founded by Russia and China to counter western influence, the Russian president attempted to rebuff any suggestion that he had been weakened by last week’s chaotic but short-lived rebellion led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied city of Donetsk, has posted images to the Telegram of him meeting local residents. He claimed that in the discussion they asked him about the prospect for elections in September. He wrote: “They also discussed the upcoming elections, which are scheduled for 10 September. First of all, the question is about the safety of our voters, we have no right to risk the lives of people.” Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that 185,000 new recruits had joined the Russian army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year. In a video posted on Telegram, Medvedev, who was earlier this year appointed to a role overseeing Russia’s domestic military production, said that almost 10,000 new recruits had joined up in the last week, after a mutiny by the Wagner group mercenary organisation was quelled and its fighters were given the option of signing on as regular soldiers. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has said it was lending €25m (£21.4m) to the Ukrainian city of Dnipro to help it cope with an influx of people fleeing fighting. It said the loan would help ensure the continuous provision of vital municipal services in the south-eastern city after the arrival of people forced to flee other locations because of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Reuters reported. US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday welcomed Nato’s decision to extend secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s term by a further year. “With his steady leadership, experience, and judgment, secretary general Stoltenberg has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since the second world war,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. The Kremlin has said there were “certain contacts” with the United States over the case of detained Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, but that it did not want to make them public. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made the comments in a regular briefing, Reuters reported. Suspilne reports that a man and a woman were killed Tuesday morning in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson. Additionally, three people have been injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv oblast. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that the Ukrainian power line connected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been cut off. It cited Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of the Rosenergoatom. A prominent Russian journalist and a lawyer were attacked and suffered serious injuries after several masked men in the Russian region of Chechnya forced their car to stop on Tuesday. Journalist Elena Milashina had her head shaved, several fingers broken, and was covered with green dye in the attack, according to human rights group Memorial. The well-known journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper was travelling to the Chechen capital Grozny from the local airport with lawyer Alexander Nemov, when they were attacked. Pope Francis’s peace envoy for Ukraine, cardinal Matteo Zuppi, said on Tuesday he is working on a “mechanism” that could ensure the return of children who according to Kyiv have been abducted to Russia. “We’ll see how we can start the mechanism for the children (and) help as we have said on the humanitarian front, particularly the children that must be able to return to Ukraine”, Zuppi said at a book presentation in Rome. Switzerland plans to take part in a Europe-wide air defence project initiated in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The country is the second neutral nation after Austria to signal its intention to join the European Sky Shield Initiative launched by Germany last year, Reuters reported. Italy has frozen Russian oligarchs’ assets valued at about €2bn ($2.5bn) after the invasion of Ukraine last year, the country’s central bank said on Tuesday. Italy seized assets – including bank accounts, luxury villas, yachts and cars – as part of the European Union’s sanctions against the Kremlin and its backers, Reuters reported. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Pope Francis’s peace envoy for Ukraine, cardinal Matteo Zuppi, said on Tuesday he is working on a “mechanism” that could ensure the return of children who according to Kyiv have been abducted to Russia. “We’ll see how we can start the mechanism for the children (and) help as we have said on the humanitarian front, particularly the children that must be able to return to Ukraine”, Zuppi said at a book presentation in Rome. He said he had personally discussed the issue with Francis. The Italian cardinal visited Moscow last week, and was previously in the Ukrainian capital. The Vatican has described his efforts as “aimed at identifying humanitarian initiatives, which could open roads to peace”. Ukrainian officials said at least 38 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Television footage from the small town of Pervomaiskyi showed a nine-storey residential building with smashed windows and black smoke pouring out. Mangled cars were in flames nearby, and a man sat in an ambulance with blood over his face, Reuters reported. Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said an Iskander missile had slammed into a residential quarter in Pervomaiskyi at 1.35pm Kyiv time (10.35am GMT). The apartments of about 2,000 people were damaged in the attack on the town, which lies near the border with Russia, and residents were being provided with hot meals, he said. Prosecutors said the youngest of the 38 people hurt in the attack was a child of three months. The child’s condition was not immediately clear. Switzerland plans to take part in a Europe-wide air defence project initiated in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The country is the second neutral nation after Austria to signal its intention to join the European Sky Shield Initiative launched by Germany last year, Reuters reported. Swiss defence minister, Viola Amherd, and her Austrian counterpart will sign a memorandum of understanding at a meeting on Friday in Berne with Germany’s Boris Pistorius. The European Sky Shield Initiative, or ESSI, was proposed by German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, last August as a means of bundling the continent’s efforts to defend against possible aircraft or missile attacks. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that 185,000 new recruits had joined the Russian army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year. In a video posted on Telegram, Medvedev, who was earlier this year appointed to a role overseeing Russia’s domestic military production, said that almost 10,000 new recruits had joined up in the last week, after a mutiny by the Wagner group mercenary organisation was quelled and its fighters were given the option of signing on as regular soldiers. The Guardian’s defence editor Dan Sabbagh has tweeted that the UK’s head of armed forces says Ukraine’s full counteroffensive “still hasn’t happened”. More on the comments from Tony Radakin at the defence select committee in Westminster below… The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has said it was lending €25m (£21.4m) to the Ukrainian city of Dnipro to help it cope with an influx of people fleeing fighting. It said the loan would help ensure the continuous provision of vital municipal services in the south-eastern city after the arrival of people forced to flee other locations because of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Reuters reported. “Dnipro and its key municipal utilities have been seriously affected by the war and are struggling to keep day-to-day operations functioning,” the EBRD said in a statement. Dnipro’s prewar population of about 1 million people has been swollen by constant inflows of internally displaced people even though the city has also come under fire since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. In an address from the Kremlin to a virtual gathering of leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group founded by Russia and China to counter western influence, the Russian president attempted to rebuff any suggestion that he had been weakened by last week’s chaotic but short-lived rebellion led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. “The Russian people are united as never before,” said Putin. “The solidarity and responsibility for the fate of the fatherland was clearly demonstrated by the Russian political circles and the entire society by standing as a united front against the attempted armed rebellion.” He also thanked the leaders present at the meeting, which included Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, China’s president, Xi Jinping, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif and Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, for their support for the Russian leadership during the threat to “constitutional order and the life and security of citizens” – thought to be a reference to the Wagner uprising. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of her country in 2022, Amelina set aside most of her writing to document and research war crimes. Ukrainian author Andrey Kurkov paid tribute to her in the Guardian, writing: “I hope that with time English readers will be able to get acquainted with Amelina’s work, but I also hope that one of her colleagues will write a biographical book about her life, her humour and kindness, her incredible energy and eternal smile which sparkled even in the most difficult times.” A service will also be held in her memory in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv tomorrow. You can read one of her works here: Poem About a Crow Reuters has reported that Hungary’s foreign minister said on Tuesday he had been in touch with his Turkish counterpart about a ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership, and if there was a shift in Turkey’s stance then Hungary will not delay the process. Hungary and Turkey remain the only two members of the alliance yet to ratify Sweden’s admission. Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied city of Donetsk, has posted images to the Telegram of him meeting local residents. He claimed that in the discussion they asked him about the prospect for elections in September. He wrote: “They also discussed the upcoming elections, which are scheduled for 10 September. First of all, the question is about the safety of our voters, we have no right to risk the lives of people.” Russia unilaterally claimed to annex Donetsk last year, and it is planning to hold regional and municipal elections on 10 September, along with the rest of the Russian Federation. However, on Monday, Ella Panfilova, who chairs Russia’s central election commission, told the Russian president, Vladimir Putin: “Since the situation is really difficult, anything can happen. If unforeseen circumstances arise – in some areas the situation may deteriorate dramatically - and we see that there is a serious danger to the life and health of residents, then we have the right to postpone these elections.” A proposal by the UN to set up a special communications channel between JP Morgan and Russia’s state agricultural bank is not a valid alternative to reconnecting the bank to the international Swift payments system, Reuters reports a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Connecting the bank to international finance has been a key Russian demand for extending the Black Sea grain initiative. US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday welcomed Nato’s decision to extend secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s term by a further year. [See 10.33am BST] “With his steady leadership, experience, and judgment, secretary general Stoltenberg has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since the second world war,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. Reuters reports the president said the Nato alliance was currently “stronger, more united and purposeful than it has ever been”. Earlier British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “Under Stoltenberg’s leadership, Nato has evolved to meet new threats, continued to protect our people and has been steadfast in support of Ukraine”, adding that he was “looking forward to continuing that work together.” Nato’s Vilnius summit will be held next week. Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Ukrainian servicemen ride in a T-80 main battle tank captured earlier from Russian troops, along a road near the frontline town of Bakhmut. Russian shelling wounded 12 people, including five children, in the small town of Pervomaisk in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region on Tuesday, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. Synehubov said on the Telegram messaging app that the shelling took place at 1.35pm Kyiv time (10.35 GMT) and several cars were on fire. Italy has frozen Russian oligarchs’ assets valued at about €2bn ($2.5bn) after the invasion of Ukraine last year, the country’s central bank said on Tuesday. Italy seized assets – including bank accounts, luxury villas, yachts and cars – as part of the European Union’s sanctions against the Kremlin and its backers, Reuters reported. In its annual report, the Bank of Italy’s anti-money laundering unit (UIF) said the €2bn figure had been updated to the end of June. UIF director Enzo Serata added that financial holdings worth about €330m, linked to 80 individuals, had been frozen as part of the sanctions regime. Before the war began in February 2022, Italy’s beaches and ports were a popular playground for wealthy Russians who bought properties in prime locations such as Lake Como, Sardinia, Tuscany and the Ligurian coast. The Kremlin has said there were “certain contacts” with the United States over the case of detained Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, but that it did not want to make them public. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made the comments in a regular briefing, Reuters reported. Russia accuses Gershkovich of espionage, something he denies. Luke Harding has been in Ukraine speaking to residents in Nikopol, who live near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: The town of Nikopol – current population 50,000 – and other nearby cities are taking the threat of damage to the nuclear plant seriously. Last week for the first time they carried out radiation drills, a rehearsal for what locals should do in case of a repeat of the 1986 Chornobyl disaster. “The Zaporizhzhia plant is on my doorstep. You can see it,” resident Anna Supranova said. “If there is a nuclear leak we will fetch the dog, go inside and close the windows and doors. Unfortunately we don’t have a car. We won’t get far on foot.” She, her husband, Serhiy, and 15-year-old daughter, Angelina, would wait for rescue. “I’m not sure who exactly would come,” she admitted. Speaking on Monday, the Nikopol military district chief Yevhen Yevtushenko said the situation was under control. Radiation levels were normal. There was no sign that the Russians were leaving the plant in big numbers, he said. The authorities were not planning a forced evacuation – for now. Since Russia’s all-out attack in February 2022 about half of the town’s population had moved to safer areas, he said. Read more of Luke Harding’s dispatch from Ukraine here: ‘It looks like Mars’ – Nikopol locals on life without water after dam explosion Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Ukraine attempted to strike civil infrastructure, including the airport, which amounted to an “act of terrorism”. Over 18,000 civilians have been recorded as casualties inside Ukraine by the UN since Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country began in February 2022. Nato members have agreed to extend the term of secretary general Jens Stoltenberg for a further year. The former prime minister of Norway has been in the role since 2014. In a statement on social media he said he was “honoured” and that “in a more dangerous world, our alliance is more important than ever.” Russian president Vladimir Putin has told a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that the world faces an increasing risk of conflict due to economic and financial instability, and thanked the leaders of China and India for their support during the recent Wagner mutiny in the country. Suspilne reports that a man and a woman were killed Tuesday morning in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson. Additionally, three people have been injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv oblast. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that the Ukrainian power line connected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been cut off.

A prominent Russian journalist and a lawyer were attacked and suffered serious injuries after several masked men in the Russian region of Chechnya forced their car to stop on Tuesday. Journalist Elena Milashina had her head shaved, several fingers broken, and was covered with green dye in the attack, according to human rights group Memorial. The well-known journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper was travelling to the Chechen capital Grozny from the local airport with lawyer Alexander Nemov, when they were attacked. Reports said Nemov had been stabbed in the leg, and that their attackers had made it clear the duo were being punished for their activism and reporting. Nato has confirmed that secretary general Jens Stoltenberg will remain in his post for an additional year, not stepping down until October 2024. Stoltenberg, the former prime minister of Norway, is the 13th secretary general of Nato and has been in the role since 2014. In a statement on social media, Stoltenberg said: Honoured by Nato allies decision to extend my term as secretary general until 1 October 2024. The transatlantic bond between Europe and North America has ensured our freedom and security for nearly 75 years, and in a more dangerous world, our alliance is more important than ever. Stoltenberg had been due to step down later this year, with the UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace apparently interested in taking up the role. However French president Emmanuel Macron was believed to have been insistent that the position should be taken by someone from an EU member state, with Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen a contender. President Putin has told a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that the world faces an increasing risk of conflict due to economic and financial instability, and thanked the leaders of China and India for their support during the recent Wagner mutiny in the country. Interfax quotes Russia’s president saying: The risks of a new global economic and financial crisis are rising against the backdrop of uncontrolled accumulation of debts in developed countries, social stratification and growing poverty around the world, deteriorating food and environmental security. All these problems, each of which is complex and diverse in its own way, in their totality lead to a noticeable increase in conflict potential. Russia feels all this directly itself. On the topic of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group, which he has since revealed was funded by the state, Putin said: The Russian people are more consolidated than ever. The Russian political circles and the whole of society clearly demonstrated the solidarity and high responsibility for the fate of the fatherland by speaking out as a united front against the attempted armed rebellion. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues from the SCO countries who expressed support for the actions of the Russian leadership to protect the constitutional order life and safety of citizens. We highly appreciate it. Putin also proposed a reform of the SCO’s regional anti-terrorism structure, and called for the speedy accession of Belarus to the group. SCO membership is currently China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, with Belarus, Mongolia and Iran having observer status. President Putin is currently addressing the SCO summit. In his opening remarks he said that the global potential for conflicts is rising, and that Russia will stand up to sanctions and provocations. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that the Ukrainian power line connected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been cut off. It cited Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of the Rosenergoatom. More details soon … President Putin is expected to address the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit today. The event is being attended by leaders from China, India and Pakistan among others. Earlier an unofficial Kremlin press pool Telegram channel posted a short clip of Putin on a video call with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. India is hosting the summit. China’s president Xi Jinping is currently giving a virtual address at the event. We will bring you any key information that emerges. A prominent Russian journalist and a lawyer were attacked and suffered serious injuries after several masked men in the Russian region of Chechnya forced their car to stop on Tuesday, the journalist’s employer and rights groups told Reuters. Journalist Elena Milashina had her head shaved, several fingers broken, and was covered with green dye in the attack, according to human rights group Memorial. The well-known journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper was travelling to the Chechen capital Grozny from the local airport with lawyer Alexander Nemov, when they were attacked. Reports said Nemov had been stabbed in the leg, and that their attackers had made it clear the duo were being punished for their activism and reporting. Reuters reports there was no immediate comment from the authorities in Chechnya. Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, has posted to social media images of the first working meeting of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression (ICPA) in The Hague. He said: First working meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors at ICPA in The Hague. Defining the scope of work and key priorities. The strategic goal is the accountability of Russia’s political and military leadership. This is history in the making: we’re laying the groundwork for the future tribunal. Suspilne reports that three people have been injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv oblast. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive. He posted: At this stage of active hostilities, Ukraine’s defence forces are fulfilling the number one task – the maximum destruction of manpower, equipment, fuel depots, military vehicles, command posts, artillery and air defence forces of the Russian army. The last few days have been particularly fruitful. Now the war of destruction is equal to the war of kilometres. More destroyed means more liberated. The more effective the former, the more the latter. We are acting calmly, wisely, step by step. In addition to the raised death toll in Sumy, Reuters is reporting that a man and a woman have been killed in the morning Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson. Citing the local prosecutor’s office, it reports that damage to property has also been recorded, and the number of wounded is currently being ascertained. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has reported an increase in the death toll in the Sumy drone attack to three. On its official Telegram channel, it wrote: In Sumy, the number of people killed as a result of a drone attack on a residential building on 3 July increased to three people. Mayor Lysenko reported 21 people were injured, and four people are in hospital. 4 July has been declared a day of mourning in Sumy. Moscow’s Vnukovo airport has resumed operations, Russia’s aviation watchdog Rosaviatsiya said on Telegram, after operations were briefly suspended amid what Russia’s foreign ministry said was a drone attack by Ukraine. Operations resumed at 8am local time. Ukraine attempted to strike civil infrastructure including the airport which amounts to an “act of terrorism”, Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Tuesday. “The Kyiv regime’s attempt to attack an area where civilian infrastructure is located, including the airport, which incidentally also receives foreign flights, is yet another act of terrorism,” Zakharova wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Several drones attacked Moscow and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the major Vnukovo airport on Tuesday. Moscow’s mayor said the attack had been repelled. Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow’s mayor, said on Tuesday that Ukraine launched another drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated.” There were no casualties or injured reported, Sobyanin added. Landings and takeoffs at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport were restricted this morning “for technical reasons beyond the control of the airport,” Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, or Rosaviatsiya, said on Telegram. Restrictions were in place until 8am local time (0600 BST), the agency said. It added that a number of flights were diverted to other airports and that other Moscow airports were functioning normally. It was not immediately known whether the changes were related to a number of drones being intercepted early on Tuesday near Moscow. Nato members are expected to agree today to extend the term of secretary general Jens Stoltenberg for a further year, according to four diplomats interviewed by Reuters. The decision has been widely signalled in recent weeks but ambassadors to Nato are expected to formally approve the extension during a meeting on Tuesday, said the diplomats, who spoke on Monday on condition of anonymity. Stoltenberg, 64, is a former prime minister of Norway. He was due to complete his term as the top civilian at the transatlantic security alliance at the end of September but is now likely to stay on for a further 12 months. Two drones were intercepted in the skies over the Moscow region and one in the neighbouring Kaluga region, Russia’s TASS state news agency reported on Tuesday, citing emergency services. “According to preliminary information, three drones were heading towards Moscow at different times,” TASS cited a source with the services as saying. Two drones were intercepted in the Novaya Moskva district of the Moscow region and one in the Kaluga region, just southwest of the Moscow region. RIA news agency reported that the two drones were shot down near the village of Valuevo. The village is located about 30 kilometres (19 miles) southwest of the Kremlin. No casualties or damage were reported. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Today’s top stories: Nato members are expected to agree on Tuesday to extend the term of secretary general Jens Stoltenberg for a further year, according to four diplomats who have spoken to Reuters. And two drones were intercepted in the skies over the Moscow region and one in the neighbouring Kaluga region, Russia’s TASS state news agency said, citing emergency services. More key recent developments: At least two people were killed and 19 injured in a Russian drone attack on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy. A five-year-old boy was among the injured. An official building and two residential buildings were damaged in an attack carried out with four drones, the regional administration said on Telegram. Ukraine said on Monday its troops had regained more ground along eastern and southern fronts in what President Zelenskiy described as progress in a “difficult” week for Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces. The US ambassador to Russia met with jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Moscow. Lynne Tracy met with Gershkovich on Monday after being granted access, her second visit since his detention in March. She has accused Russia of conducting “hostage diplomacy.” On Thursday, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, told reporters that the country had tried to get consular access to Gershkovich “virtually every day.” Zelenskiy asked the Georgian ambassador to Kyiv to return home to try to “save” jailed ex-leader Mikheil Saakashvili after footage showed him looking emaciated. Saakashvili, a Ukrainian citizen, was jailed in 2021 after returning from exile on abuse of power charges that rights groups denounce as politically motivated. Zelenskiy wants Saakashvili to be transferred to a clinic in Ukraine or the west. Zelenskiy and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, called on Monday for the extension of the Black Sea grain deal, which allows the safe export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports, an official said. After a call between the two leaders, Zelenskiy said he and Scholz focused on defence cooperation and on the forthcoming Nato summit in Lithuania, where Ukraine wants to secure an indication of future membership in the alliance. An international office to investigate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine opened on Monday in The Hague, in the first step towards a possible tribunal for Moscow’s leadership. It will investigate and gather evidence in a move seen as an interim step before the creation of a special tribunal that could bring Kremlin officials to justice for starting the Ukraine war. There is no need for a further mobilisation in Russia to replace Wagner fighters who have left the battlefield in Ukraine after a short-lived mutiny, Russian state media said on Monday, quoting Andrey Kartapolov, head of the state duma’s defence committee. The Russian-imposed leader in occupied Kherson, Andrey Alekseyenko, has stated that the damage to the Chongar Bridge linking Kherson and Crimea has been repaired. It was struck by Ukrainian forces in June. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that Russian security forces claim to have foiled a plot to assassinate the Russian-imposed head of Crimea. It claims Sergei Aksyonov was to be targeted with a car bomb.

Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure.

Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment”. He added that Russia is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. The Prince of Wales travelled to Poland as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/03/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T18:00:21Z","webTitle":" What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis and opinion. A bloody morass in Bakhmut Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, Peter Beaumont reported, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces are able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, including reinforcements previously in the Kherson region, the fighting in the Bakhmut sector has turned into trench warfare reminiscent of the first world war. Over the weekend, images emerged of Ukrainian soldiers in flooded, muddy trenches and battlefields dotted with the stumps of trees cut down by withering artillery barrages. The Ukrainian artists taking on Putin’s Russia Where to begin a story of war, Charlotte Higgins asked in her feature on Ukrainian artists this week. Every war teems with stories: of survival and violence, of resistance and compliance, of struggle and terror. They go together; many of the oldest stories that survive (the Iliad, the Odyssey) are stories of war and its aftermath. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a war full of stories but also a war about a story, about the accepted facts, about the prevailing narrative. Vladimir Putin’s “special operation”, as he calls it, seems to have been intended to provide a spectacle, a kind of war movie, for domestic consumption, drawing Russians together against what he hoped to frame as a common enemy – described variously as Nazis, terrorists or even, bizarrely, as the forces of Satan. At the same time, the war’s false justification has its own disturbing narrative, its own warped internal logic. Underlying Putin’s military aggression, as his speeches and essays have for years made clear, is his assertion that Ukraine has no distinct existence – that it can be seen only as an adjunct to Russia. In such a war on a nation’s culture, identity and history, it is artists and cultural figures who find themselves the crack troops of the resistance. The war is on one level about borders, and it is being fought with shells, Himars rocket launchers and Shahed-136 drones. But it is, on a deeper level, about culture. And, desperately holding the line, fighting on the cultural front, weaponising their work, are Ukraine’s artists. Fears for all Ukraine’s nuclear plants after emergency shutdowns There are growing fears that Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of an unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday, Julian Borger reported. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said that all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday, but two generators were damaged in the process, delaying the restart of two reactors. Kotin said repeated shutdowns caused by more Russian missile attacks could cause extensive damage, with a potentially severe impact on Ukraine’s power supply and possibly on nuclear safety. ‘Russia wins by losing’ Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who leads a crowdfunding campaign to raise $1.25m to fund an anti-drone system to detect enemy devices and jam signals, told Jennifer Rankin that it would be good for world peace if Russia lost the war. “Russia wins by losing. Russia really needs to lose this war, and to lose it decisively,” he said. “The whole colonial move towards Ukraine is a distraction, a substitute for the internal changes which Russia really has to make. “What European history really shows, and quite powerfully, is that in order to become, quote unquote, a ‘normal’ European country, you have to become post-imperial, [meaning] you have to lose your wars.” For this reason, he thinks meaningful negotiations can only take place once Ukraine has won the war. Russians are already signalling that negotiations are only a means “to regroup and attack again. And so I think we should probably listen to them when they say that.” Letter bombs in Spain Spain has ordered increased security at government buildings and embassies after the discovery of six letter bombs and incendiary devices over the past seven days, Sam Jones reported, including one that exploded at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid on Wednesday and another that was detected at the US embassy on Thursday. Devices have also been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital. Spain’s secretary of state for security said initial analysis suggested the packages had been sent from within Spain. “They’re similar-looking brown envelopes,” Rafael Pérez said in Madrid on Thursday. “We’re at the early stages of our investigation. While there are signs that they came from Spanish territory, let’s be prudent.” The defining images of war in winter The defining image of the current state of the war in Ukraine – and a metaphor for the entire country – is the snow-covered rubble of a residential building split in two by a Russian bomb in the town of Borodianka, Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger wrote this week. “Some people who lived in that building have died as a result of the conflict. Others have managed to escape, joining the great exodus of refugees toward Europe. Some are now living in a dormitory on the outskirts of the town, struggling, like millions of other Ukrainians, with the nightmare of what is expected to be the hardest winter in the country’s history since the second world war.” This week, Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid were running out amid sustained Russian bombing. ‘Russia is trying to freeze us to death’ In a comment piece, the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, wrote that his country was facing a new terror as Russia targeted its civilian energy infrastructure: death by freezing. “Have you ever tried to imagine mass death from freezing? Millions of slow, torturous, painful deaths – no movie or book can convey these horrors, either, and we don’t even want to try to imagine them.” But, he writes, Russia will fail. “Darkness will always be better than slavery. To stay free, we need further help from our friends and allies. Immediately. Now. Yesterday. We need reliable protection for our skies. We need resources to restore the power grids. We need generators to keep people warm while emergency workers repair broken infrastructure. In short, we need the light of hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/17/major-incident-doubledecker-bus-overturns-somerset","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-17T15:09:03Z","webTitle":"Dozens injured after doubledecker bus carrying 70 overturns in Somerset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/major-incident-doubledecker-bus-overturns-somerset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/major-incident-doubledecker-bus-overturns-somerset","fields":{"headline":"Dozens injured after doubledecker bus carrying 70 overturns in Somerset","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dozens of people were injured, three seriously, after a doubledecker bus carrying 70 construction workers overturned in Somerset, police have said, as what was initially declared a major incident was stood down. Avon and Somerset police said a significant number of police, fire and ambulance units attended the scene on the A39 Quantock Road near Bridgwater after receiving the first call at about 6am on Tuesday. A total of 54 patients were triaged at the scene, of whom 26 were treated as walking wounded, police said. Three people were freed from the bus using mechanical equipment, the fire service said. Police said a number of those treated at the scene were taken to Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, Bridgwater minor injury unit, and 40 miles away to Bristol’s Southmead hospital. The incident came as temperatures plunged below zero, creating icy conditions on the roads. The energy firm EDF confirmed on Twitter that the bus was carrying members of the workforce at Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station building site, nine miles from the site of the crash. Insp Rebecca Wells-Cole, of Avon and Somerset police, confirmed there had been no deaths. She said: “We were called to the A39 Quantock Road in Bridgewater following a report of a road-related incident involving a double-decker bus and a motorcyclist. We can now confirm the doubledecker bus was carrying 70 Hinkley Point C workers and the bus driver when it overturned. “The incident was initially declared as a major incident due to the number of people involved and the resources required. This has since been stood down.” Closures were in place at the junction of Sandford Hill and Quantock Road, police said. The Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said: “Crews used hydraulic cutting equipment and small tools to extricate three casualties from the bus.” Ceri Smart, a strategic commander at the South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT), said the service sent 23 ambulances, two critical care teams and two hazardous area response teams to the scene. The MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset, Ian Liddell-Grainger, called for the fullest investigation into the causes of the incident. “Obviously it was a terrifying experience for everyone on that bus and my thoughts are with them and their families,” he told the Bridgwater Mercury. “But we absolutely must get to the bottom of why this crash occurred because EDF is very conscious of the need to maintain the highest safety standards for the protection of their workers – and that concern naturally extends to those periods when they are being transferred to and from the site. “I am aware police have been reporting a high number of accidents in the area this morning, all of them blamed on icy road conditions. We need to establish as soon as we can whether similar circumstances played a role in this particular event.” A Somerset county council spokesperson said: “Our winter service team closely monitors the forecast in advance and all roads on Somerset’s precautionary gritting network are treated when temperatures are forecast to fall below zero. This is 21% of the county’s roads and includes all major routes. “All main routes were gritted yesterday afternoon before temperatures dropped and there was a further gritting operation across the county the following morning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T15:15:28Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 166 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 166 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led program to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T11:59:36Z","webTitle":"Ukraine has retaken 1,000 sq km of territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine has retaken 1,000 sq km of territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has retaken more than 1,000 sq km (390 sq miles) of territory and over 20 villages, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has announced, as its troops wage a counteroffensive in the south and the east of the country. Zelenskiy also released a video late on Thursday in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had taken the key eastern town of Balakliia, which has a population of 27,000 people. Earlier, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing that Ukrainian armed forces had advanced up to 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and that “the total amount of territory returned to Ukrainian control in the Kharkiv and Pivdennyi Buh directions stands at more than 700 sq km”. Gromov said Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 3km on the Sloviansk front in the east and recaptured a settlement called Ozerne. This is the first time Kyiv has disclosed details of its recent counteroffensive since last week so as not to compromise the operation. The general singled out the role of Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. “Enemy infantry and motorised artillery units unprotected by air defence systems become easy prey for our Bayraktars, the quantity of which is always increasing, thanks to our volunteers,” he said. A top US general, Mark Milley, described the progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive as “steady” and “deliberate”, and pointed in particular to the impact of US-supplied high-mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) in supporting Ukraine’s advance. “We are seeing real and measurable gains from Ukraine in the use of these systems,” Gen Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said in Ramstein, Germany. “For example, Ukrainians have struck over 400 targets with the Himars and they’ve had a devastating effect. “Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained. It is having a direct impact on the Russian ability to project and sustain combat power. Russian command and control in their headquarters have been disrupted and they’re having great difficulty in supplying their forces and replacing their combat losses.” Milley and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, were in Ramstein to meet their counterparts from about 50 countries to coordinate military support for Ukraine on a day when the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced another $2.8bn in arms supplies, both short- and long-term, for Ukraine and neighbouring states. A state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US package would “bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including … many of our Nato allies as well as other regional security partners”. Blinken made the arms announcement on a surprise visit to Kyiv. His arrival, which was not publicly expected until he landed, came after Zelenskiy, reported “good news” from the war’s frontlines. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. Also on Wednesday, an official representing the Russian-controlled self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk confirmed that Ukraine had launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region and “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Unverified footage circulating on social media showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. The US Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which follows the fighting in detail, said the Ukraine counterattack in the east drove Russian forces back to the north side of the Siverskyi Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers and that Kyiv had retaken 400 sq km of territory in the east of the Kharkiv region. It appeared that Ukraine forces had also recaptured Verbivka and that Russian forces may have destroyed bridges to prevent Ukrainian fighters from pursuing them, ISW said. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” it said. The long-awaited counteroffensive came at a crucial moment in the conflict. After months in which Ukraine’s fate seemed sealed, with Moscow cornering Ukraine in the Donbas and threatening to advance towards Odesa, the reconquest of territory by the Ukrainian armed forces seems to have raised the morale of the people, who are resigned to a conflict that could last for years. “Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favour of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. “The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be.” The Ukrainian counteroffensive in the east does not seem to have stopped the Russian bombing in the city of Kharkiv. On Thursday, the regional governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synehubov, said two people were killed and five were injured in Russian shelling in the city’s industrial district. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, gave a detailed assessment of the war to date in rare public comments published on Wednesday and warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would create the risk of a “limited” nuclear conflict with other powers, according to an opinion piece attributed in his name in Ukraine’s state news agency Ukrinform. Zaluzhnyi said the “direct threat” of Russia’s possible use of tactical nuclear weapons had had a major influence on the adoption of relevant decisions. “Another factor is the direct threat of the use by Russia, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons,” he said. “Battles on the territory of Ukraine have already demonstrated how much the Russian Federation neglects the issues of global nuclear security even in a conventional war. It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes will allow Russia to break Ukraine’s will to resist. But the threat that will emerge for the whole of Europe cannot be ignored.” Heavy fighting was raging on Thursday in areas near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine after Kyiv said it may have to shut down the plant to avoid disaster. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its daily update that some villages and communities near the plant were heavily shelled in the 24 hours to Thursday morning from “tanks, mortars, barrel and jet artillery”. The occupation of the nuclear power plant has prompted fears of a nuclear disaster as both sides trade blame for shelling the site. On Wednesday, the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who was in Rome for a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, told La Repubblica newspaper that he was moved when he visited the plant. When asked what he thought about Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy, who accused him of not saying who was to blame for the strikes on the plant, Grossi replied: “Being a judge, the referee between two contenders, is not my mandate. Indeed, if it was, it would cancel my utility as guarantor of the safety of the nuclear power plant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-15T21:09:04Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: nuclear-powered submarine deal, NSW vaccination law, Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: nuclear-powered submarine deal, NSW vaccination law, Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. There’s breaking news this morning about a major new security partnership between Australia, the US and the UK, which has big ramifications for the Morrison government’s submarine acquisition plans. There are plenty of Covid updates as well, while a Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall has attracted attention. Australia will get new nuclear-powered submarines under a security partnership with the US and UK aimed at confronting China. The initiative, called Aukus, was announced jointly by President Joe Biden and prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, after US briefings that described the agreement as binding the three English-speaking countries together. The deal is expected to mean the Morrison government will pull out of a $90bn contract with the French shipbuilder Naval Group. Australia had planned to acquire 12 new Attack-class submarines, with the first set to become operational in 2034, but Australia’s biggest defence acquisition has been plagued by delays, cost blowouts and disputes over local industry involvement. Resistance to the NSW government’s push to make dining or shopping conditional upon full vaccination will find no support from the law, a legal expert has warned, as business leaders vow to flout the mandatory double-dose vaccination requirement. The absence of a Human Rights Act in NSW offers almost no scope for discrimination on the basis of vaccine preferences, Dr Ron Levy said, meaning the legal prospects for those seeking to push back against the move were “quite poor”. Health workers across Victoria, the ACT and NSW are working shifts of up to 16 hours, with more than 2,000 frontline staff now in isolation. There are 1,190 health workers in NSW who are unavailable due to infection or exposure to Covid, with the nurse’s association’s Brett Holmes saying remaining staff “are working extraordinarily hard” to meet shortfalls. A crisis in country nursing homes is also leaving thousands of families stranded, with more than half of homes still losing money despite receiving Covid-related government funding. And Australians are self-reporting greater negativity about the future compared with during the first pandemic wave, according to national wellbeing survey. Australia A phytoplankton bloom larger than the entire Australian continent was sparked by the 2019-20 bushfires, researchers have revealed. Heavily reliant on iron traces carried by smoke particles far across the ocean, the blooms lasted several months. A leading Pentecostal church has posted a $1.2m increase in revenue after receiving $660,000 in jobkeeper payments. Hope Unlimited church saw its revenues grow from $2.8m to $4m during 2020, and accepted the public payouts despite eligibility for the scheme depending upon a forecasted decline of 15% in revenue. Scott Morrison has advised Christian Porter he wants the controversy surrounding his acceptance of funds from an unknown source resolved. The industry minister revealed this week that part of his defamation legal fees were paid by a blind trust.

The sole survivor of the 2015 jihadist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people has told his trial attackers had “nothing personal” against their civilian targets, only that the attacks were revenge for French airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.

And while it’s spring in Australia, that shouldn’t stop you from enjoying a delicacy from the Chinese autumn harvest calendar. But what are mooncakes? Jess Ho provides the details: “To explain it in the simplest, possible way, it’s a small, round pastry stuffed with either sweet or savoury filling. There are many different variations of the mooncake, depending on where in Asia you’re from – the only common element being the symbolism of the moon.” “It seems there have always been two NSWs – Sydney, and the rest of us.” Whether it’s forced council amalgamations, fire disaster response, or now, Covid vaccinations, as Tom Plevey argues, regional NSW is always the last to get a look in. “New South Wales has been set up to run off the image of Sydney and, if Sydney is looking good, then the whole state must be good, and with the concentration of power – political, social, corporate, media – in the Harbour City it’s been an easy facade to maintain.” Australian house prices are going up faster than ever before. In scenes last seen just before the global financial crisis, homes in cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra have seen hikes of 15% to 20% in the past year alone. But one man is sick of being blamed for the phenomenon, Greg Jericho explains, and that’s the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe.

Scientists mostly only counted the rise of the oceans because of expansion of warmer water then added on melting glaciers in the Alps and other temperate regions. Originally ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica were excluded, in case increased snow fall in winter was greater than the ice melt in summer. Real time measurements of ice lost in polar regions has changed that. Coastal inundation in places such as East Anglia, Florida, and the Nile and Mekong deltas is expected to be far worse and quicker than previously predicted. Food supplies are threatened. The melting is also irreversible. This makes Boris Johnson’s last act as prime minister to back a giant nuclear power plant on a low lying coast at Sizewell in Suffolk look a gamble. The builders, EDF, say there is no danger because the twin reactors will be built on a concrete raft seven metres above mean sea level, with a further surrounding wall to protect the nuclear island. But this concrete monolith will need to withstand sea level rise and storm surges for up to 200 years to protect future generations from its radioactive content."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T13:53:54Z","webTitle":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, Japanese pop pioneer and Oscar-winning composer, dies aged 71","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","fields":{"headline":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, Japanese pop pioneer and Oscar-winning composer, dies aged 71","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician whose remarkably eclectic career straddled pop, experimentalism and Oscar-winning film composition, has died aged 71. Sakamoto’s management company said he died on Tuesday. He had been undergoing treatment for cancer. As a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra alongside Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto created joyous and progressive electronic pop in the late 1970s and early 1980s, alongside solo releases. He acted alongside David Bowie in the 1983 film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and composed its celebrated theme, the first in a series of film scores including Oscar-winning work in 1987 with David Byrne and Cong Su for Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor. Sakamoto had twice been diagnosed with cancer. In 2014, he took a year off from music as he recovered from throat cancer, describing the illness as “the most harsh, physically painful time in my life”. In January 2021, he announced he had been diagnosed with bowel cancer, saying: “From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.” He was born in Tokyo in 1952, and began taking piano lessons aged six, later attending Tokyo University of the Arts to study music. He trained on early synthesisers, and enthused by everything from Debussy to Kraftwerk, began working on various musical projects, including with Hosono and Takahashi. After Sakamoto released his 1978 solo debut, Thousand Knives – playing melodies that harked back to traditional Japanese music on electronic equipment – the trio realised their vision for a Japanese disco-pop group, Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). The group became a huge success in Japan – in 1980, two of their albums stayed at No 1 and No 2 in the charts for seven weeks, and they had seven Top 5 albums during their career. “Accidentally the three of us became very popular,” he remembered in 2018. “Walking the street in Tokyo, people pointed at me. I hated it.” Their English-language lyrics helped them cross over into the US, where they appeared on the TV show Soul Train, and their electronic production influenced early hip-hop and electro scenes. Michael Jackson covered their song Behind the Mask and intended to include it on Thriller, but a royalties disagreement prevented it. Their track Computer Game was also a Top 20 hit in the UK. YMO went on hiatus in 1984, though occasionally reunited for releases and reunion concerts. Alongside YMO, Sakamoto continued releasing solo albums including 1980’s B-2 Unit, another influence on the robotically funky sound of electro that also foreshadowed other dance music styles. After focusing purely on solo work, he forged further connections in the west, collaborating with musicians including Iggy Pop, Robert Wyatt, Laurie Anderson, David Sylvian and more. Sylvian contributed Forbidden Colours, a vocal version of one of Sakamoto’s most famous works, the theme to second world war drama Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence. Sakamoto also starred in the film as a prisoner of war camp commander. Following The Last Emperor (in which he also had an acting role), he collaborated with Bernardo Bertolucci again for The Last Buddha, and with Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence director Nagisa Oshima for Gohatto. He also scored two films by Brian De Palma (Snake Eyes and Femme Fatale), plus Wild Palms for Oliver Stone, High Heels for Pedro Almodóvar, the 1990 film adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, and more. His 2015 score for Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film The Revenant was nominated for Golden Globe, Bafta and Grammy awards. In 2019, he composed the music for an episode of dystopian TV drama series Black Mirror. He took no further acting roles, aside from appearing as a film director in Rain, a music video for Madonna. Sakamoto released a steady schedule of solo releases throughout the 1990s and onwards, and wrote a piece for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. In 1999 he debuted the multimedia opera project Life, in collaboration with artist Shiro Takatani with contributions from Bertolucci, Pina Bausch and more. He and Takatani extended the concept into installation work from 2007 onwards. Also in 2007, he began the ambitious Schola project, curating 17 compilations of global music ranging from composers such as Ravel and Beethoven to Japanese pop. It was released via his record label Commmons, set up in 2006, which has also released work by artists including Boredoms and OOIOO. In 2002, he began a fruitful partnership with German musician Carsten Nicolai, who used his Alva Noto alias for four collaborative albums of minimalist electronica. Sakamoto was also an environmental campaigner, opposing the use of nuclear power, and creating the forestry project More Trees to enable carbon offsetting. In 1982, Sakamoto married Japanese pop musician Akiko Yano, a touring member of YMO and a successful solo artist in her own right. They split in 1992, and eventually filed for divorce in 2006. They had a daughter, pop singer Miu Sakamoto. Since the early 1990s, Sakamoto has been in a relationship with Norika Sora. Their son Neo Sora contributed to a documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda, directed by Stephen Nomura Schible in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T15:10:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 345 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 345 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine would fight to hold on to the eastern “fortress” city of Bakhmut for as long as it could, and urged the west to supply long-range weapons to help Kyiv push Russian forces out of the Donbas region. “Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress,” Zelenskiy told a news conference with top European Union officials following a summit in Kyiv. “Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas if it received long-range weapons,” he said. Senior EU officials including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Council president, Charles Michel, and 15 European commissioners travelled to the Ukrainian capital for talks. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders on Friday that they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, whom he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. The EU has promised a 10th package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Ursula von der Leyen said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components, as well as measures to counter circumvention of sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Zelenskiy had called on Thursday for more punitive EU measures against Russia, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelenskiy said at a news conference. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president’s comments by saying: “Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.” EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air-defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers, as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. There are reports that one person was killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar, in Zaporizhzhia region. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian police officer who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday morning that the war would continue in Ukraine as Donbas was not “fully protected yet”. Germany has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit has said. Hebestreit confirmed “an export licence has been issued” for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details. Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden in which Stockholm would provide air-defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany’s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said. Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. Nato has called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday. Traders are using Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia to evade European Union sanctions on Russia in a tactic that breaches these countries’ compliance with the bloc’s embargo, Latvia’s prime minister said. The EU said on Thursday it intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine, to be located in The Hague. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Thursday that sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require “months if not years” of training and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory. The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of its invasion on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s defence minister. Speaking to French media, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia would call on a large contingent of mobilised troops. Referring to the general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September, he claimed that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that everybody wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end, but that the west’s support for Kyiv was playing an important role in how Moscow approached the campaign. A senior Russian lieutenant who fled after serving in Ukraine has described how his country’s troops tortured prisoners of war and threatened some with rape. “I have personally seen our troops torture Ukrainian soldiers,” Konstantin Yefremov, who is the most senior soldier to speak out against the war, told the Guardian in a phone call. “I feel relieved that I can finally speak out about the things I have seen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T00:48:48Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says Labor’s renewable energy overhaul plan ‘never going to be realised’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says Labor’s renewable energy overhaul plan ‘never going to be realised’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has declared Labor’s proposal to overhaul the energy grid to boost the share of renewable generation “is never going to be realised” and says Tim Flannery ought to apologise for past statements about the link between global heating and extreme weather. During an appearance on Andrew Bolt’s program on Sky News on Thursday night, the opposition leader characterised Labor’s Rewiring the Nation program as a “pipe dream”. Dutton’s response followed Bolt declaring the “new religion” of global warming had prompted the Albanese government to adopt “frankly unbelievable and dangerous targets like making us buy electric cars, half of all new car sales by 2030 … [and] making 83% of our electricity come from unreliable renewable energy”. Bolt also raised a comment made in 2007 by Flannery, then the climate change commissioner, about global heating resulting in less rainfall over the long term before declaring “Sydney has today recorded the most annual rainfall ever, its wettest year ever”. The broadcaster asked Dutton what he concluded from this. The opposition leader responded: “Well, that Tim Flannery was dead wrong, so I presume he’ll come out and apologise for the mistake, but I wouldn’t hold your breath for that, Andrew.” What Flannery said in 2007 was, and remains, consistent with what climate science says about global heating leading to more extreme weather, like floods, droughts and bushfires. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton told Bolt rather than talking about transforming the infrastructure of Australia’s power grid to ensure more power can be generated reliably from low-emissions sources, Australia needed to consider nuclear energy. “I mean, we’ve started this debate on nuclear power in our country,” Dutton told Bolt. “It’s absurd that in the year 2022 we can’t be talking about safe new technology in the form of the small modular reactors, and France, Canada, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and many other countries have either adopted or are considering the adoption of nuclear power to firm up the renewables in the system. “We’re talking in Europe at the moment about a catastrophic winter where people are going to either feed themselves or turn on their heaters, but they’re not going to be able to afford to do both. “So, power prices will continue to go through the roof in our country whilst Labor pursues their zealot-like approach.” A range of studies are clear that nuclear energy is one of the most expensive forms of power generation and renewables the cheapest. Earlier this year, the CSIRO found wind and solar generation are “the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia, even when considering additional integration costs arising due to the variable output of renewables, such as energy storage and transmission”. The CSIRO examined the viability of small modular nuclear reactors through a consultation process with Australia’s electricity sector and concluded there was no prospect “of domestic projects this decade, given the technology’s commercial immaturity and high cost”. The CSIRO noted future cost reductions were possible in time, but that depended “on its successful commercial deployment overseas”. Dutton was part of a government that signed the Paris agreement, which commits developed and developing countries to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. Climate science suggests Australia cannot afford to wait for a decade to see whether small modular reactors are economically feasible and can be deployed at scale. According to the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 and can be nearly halved this decade, which would give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. On the Bolt program on Thursday night, Dutton said he was “happy to see renewables in the system, but it needs to be firmed up and if you don’t like coal and gas and you don’t believe hydrogen’s coming any time soon and hydro is not going to fit the bill, what are you left with?” In 2021, the International Energy Agency said if the world was to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, there must be no new oil and gas development and no new coal-fired power stations built. The Liberal party has lost the electorates of Warringah, North Sydney, Mackellar, Goldstein, Kooyong and Curtin over the past two federal election cycles in part because voters are concerned about the Coalition’s failure to act on climate change. Despite this wipe-out in the party’s metropolitan heartland, Dutton resolved after he took the opposition leadership that he would oppose Labor’s 2030 emissions reduction target of 43%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/09/sunak-starmer-policy-scramble-ai-surges-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T13:56:24Z","webTitle":"‘Late in the game’: Sunak and Starmer in policy scramble as AI surges ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/09/sunak-starmer-policy-scramble-ai-surges-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/09/sunak-starmer-policy-scramble-ai-surges-ahead","fields":{"headline":"‘Late in the game’: Sunak and Starmer in policy scramble as AI surges ahead","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak will set out his views on artificial intelligence next week to an audience of technology industry insiders during a keynote speech at London Tech Week. Twenty-four hours later, Keir Starmer will do the same. The prime minister and the Labour leader have a habit of speaking at the same venue within a day of each other – they did so at the beginning of the year when setting out their competing visions for the country from the same room at the Olympic Park in east London. The fact they are doing so again but on the far more technical and detailed question of AI shows how quickly the issue has rocketed up the political agenda. “We have been working on AI policy for a long time,” said one government official. “But suddenly the interest in this work has spiked. Everyone wants to weigh in, from cabinet ministers to industry to academia.” The shift has come from the top of government. Sunak himself, who used to speak enthusiastically about the opportunities AI presented, has gone on something of a re-education course, meeting industry executives and issuing statements about the “existential” risks it poses. This week, the prime minister has been in Washington DC lobbying Joe Biden to put the UK at the centre of efforts to formulate a global set of principles that will govern how countries regulate the industry. British officials argue the UK is ideally placed for such a task. London is home to Google DeepMind, and this week the technology company Palantir announced it would make Britain its European headquarters for AI development. Officials also say the UK position of overseeing AI development with broad principles makes more sense than trying to regulate individual technologies, as the EU has done. Sunak had some success, persuading the US president to sign up to an AI summit to be hosted in the UK later this year. British officials say “like-minded countries” will be invited, giving a heavy hint that China will not. Politico revealed on Friday that Sunak had appointed Henry de Zoete, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, to help organise the summit and advise Downing Street on AI more generally. But experts say it remains highly unlikely the prime minister will succeed in a second mission: to persuade other countries to use the UK as a base for a new global AI regulator, along the lines of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This idea had already been mooted at the G7 summit in Hiroshima where the US, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and the EU agreed a framework to work together to progress global governance on AI. The EU is concerned that although it may produce the world’s first AI laws this year, there will be a gap to bridge between legislation and implementation. This week, the European Commission started preparing companies for digital services legislation coming into force in August, asking 44 companies including Google and Facebook to “immediately” start labelling AI content. Dragoș Tudorache, a Romanian MEP who is a co-rapporteur on the committee progressing the EU’s AI act through the European parliament, said the UK was “late in the game”. “All jurisdictions are waking up to a reality that we have seen coming and we have been discussing about for quite some time,” Tudorache said. “The idea should not be to start a race as to who hosts what. I think we need to use the political energy of all the leaders … and ask how do we now diligently, responsibly sit around a global table and think what do we do next?” Prof David Leslie, the director of ethics and responsible innovation research at the Alan Turing Institute, said: “The UK has been a leader in AI policy innovation, but right now there are significant headwinds against setting up a new international regulatory body.” Privately, British officials admit that securing agreement from a diverse array of countries, especially those in the EU with which the UK until recently had a fractious relationship, is unlikely. “Can you imagine getting the French to sign up to having the UK lead the way on AI regulation?” said one. “It’s not going to happen.” Officials in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) are busy speaking to industry figures about their own AI white paper, which was published in March but which critics say is already out of date. The department is consulting on the paper’s recommendations, which include a set of principles such as transparency, accountability and innovation, but say relatively little about how to regulate individual threats. Those close to the consultation process, which closes on 21 June, acknowledge that their response to that consultation will have to contain more specific policy proposals than the white paper did. But they say it will not recommend setting up a specific AI regulator, something many in the industry have called for. Labour is hastily working out its policy towards the technology. Last week, Lucy Powell, the shadow digital secretary, told the Guardian said she wanted a licensing regime for those building large datasets on which to train AI tools. Such a model, which could work like those for medicines or nuclear power, would allow ministers to insist that developers share their datasets with the government, or that they sell them only to approved buyers. Shadow ministers also say they would implement some form of centralised AI regulation if they win next year’s election, whether that is in the form of a coordinating unit between existing regulators or a separate regulator entirely. But the party is hampered by the fact it does not yet have someone directly shadowing the DSIT. Powell’s role covers everything from media regulation to arts funding to technology, and some in the party want Starmer to reshuffle his frontbench to create a science and innovation spokesperson. One Labour MP this week accused Powell of “freelancing” on the issue of AI, causing irritation among those close to her, who say it is a core part of her job. While the government consults and Labour bickers, the technology is surging ahead. Facebook’s parent company, Meta, announced a new push into AI this week that would allow users of its Messenger to generate their own artificially created images. And researchers in San Francisco found they could manipulate AI software made by Nvidia to get it to reveal users’ personal information. “Things have moved on quite quickly even since the white paper,” said Marion Oswald, a professor at Northumbria University who researches the interaction between technology and the law. “We need much more clarity on how you interpret the principles we have been talking about, rather than just leaving this to every regulator. Otherwise I think there is a risk we will end up making a lot of mistakes, and people will suffer as a result.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-launches-further-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-damaging-hospital-as-water-restored-in-kyiv","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T18:55:50Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: shelling forces Kherson hospitals to evacuate as UN warns millions plunged into hardship – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-launches-further-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-damaging-hospital-as-water-restored-in-kyiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-launches-further-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-damaging-hospital-as-water-restored-in-kyiv","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: shelling forces Kherson hospitals to evacuate as UN warns millions plunged into hardship – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said. In a statement after a phone call with Zelenskiy, she said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. Hospital patients are being evacuated from Kherson city because of bombardment by Russian forces, said the governor of the region, Yaroslav Yanushevych. The recently recaptured city in the south of the country faced heavy shelling last night. Russian strikes damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. The UN’s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants had been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has met a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine in a carefully staged encounter meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to reach a deal on the price level for Russian oil. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and conservative opposition leaders, aims to serve as a warning to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, travelled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise the UK’s support for as long as it takes. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021. Payam Kia, 35, and his brother Peyman Kia, 42, could face life sentences if found guilty. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has met mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Around a table laid with tea, cakes and bowls of fresh berries, he told them he shared in their suffering and the entire Russian leadership understood the pain of those who had lost their sons. Advocates of soldiers’ families and rights groups have said Putin snubbed them for the meeting. Valentina Melnikova, who has been an advocate for soldiers’ families for more than three decades, told the Guardian that “they didn’t invite us and we of course don’t want to go”. A Swedish court has ordered a man to be remanded in custody on suspicion of illegal intelligence activities against Sweden and a foreign power. The man, who has Russian roots, was arrested by police on Tuesday morning after a raid on a house in an affluent Stockholm suburb, Reuters reports. The suspected crimes were said to have taken place between July 2014 until the day of the arrest. Prosecutors said a second person arrested in Tuesday’s raid had been released but remained a suspect. Both have denied any wrongdoing. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had been informed by Ukraine that its Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi plants had been reconnected. Power had also been restored to the Chernobyl site, it said. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, said on Wednesday that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear plant in southern Ukraine because of a loss of power during Russian airstrikes. Units were also not operating at the Khmelnytskyi plant in western Ukraine, according to a local official. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also tweeted about his call with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and said the pair discussed cooperation on ensuring energy stability for his country. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said after a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a statement, she said the EU was preparing the delivery to Ukraine “as quickly as possible” of large donations from the bloc’s member states and from the commission’s reserves. She said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. Each of these generators “can provide uninterrupted power to a small to medium-sized hospital”, she said. She added that she expressed the EU’s “full solidarity” with the Ukrainian people at the hands of Vladimir Putin’s “deliberate and barbaric bombing” of the country’s civilian infrastructure during her call with Zelenskiy. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021. Payam Kia, 35, and his brother Peyman Kia, 42, were detained last year on suspicion of providing the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, with classified information over a period of a decade. Prosecutors say the older brother is also charged with gross unauthorised handling of secret information. According to Swedish media, he previously worked for the Office for Special Information Gathering (KSI), the most secret section of the military secret service. Both men have previously denied all allegations. In his opening statement, the prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist told the court: This case is unique in many ways … We haven’t had a trial like this in more than 20 years. He said the information obtained, transmitted and divulged was “extremely sensitive material”, while his co-prosecutor Per Lindqvist said the sharing of it could be “detrimental to Sweden’s national security”. The trial is expected to run until at least 12 December and will mostly take place behind closed doors because of national security concerns. The brothers could face life sentences if found guilty. In a separate case, Swedish police this week arrested two people on suspicion of espionage. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, sources have told Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to reach a deal on the price level for Russian oil. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Six of the EU’s 27 member countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, Reuters cited diplomats as saying on Thursday. Vladimir Putin has met a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine for a carefully staged meeting meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. The Guardian has managed to confirm the identifies of at least three of the women who met with Putin on Friday in a highly publicised meeting at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo on the outskirts of Moscow. None of the women are critical of the war against Ukraine and several have publicly sought to quell fears about the poor treatment, inadequate training and dangers faced by Russian troops being mustered to be sent to the front. Yet the very fact of the meeting showed that the Kremlin is worried about the perception of its mobilisation at home. “It is clear that life is more complicated and diverse than what is shown on TV screens or even on the internet – you can’t trust anything there at all, there are a lot of all sorts of fakes, deception, lies,” Putin told the women, who were seated around a large, oval table. This is why we have gathered with you, that’s why I proposed this meeting, because I wanted to listen to you first-hand. One of the women sitting next to Putin was Olesya Shigina, an ultra-conservative Russian poet, film-maker and activist who recently travelled to the Donbas region to direct a pro-war film featuring Russian troops. Read the full story by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer here: It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. Hospital patients are being evacuated from Kherson city because of bombardment by Russian forces, the governor of the region, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. The recently recaptured city in the south of the country faced heavy shelling last night. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. Its chief executive, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, encouraged Ukrainians to save energy where possible.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said Russian attacks on critical Ukrainian infrastructure are a sign of President Vladimir Putin’s “desperation”. Putin is targeting Ukraine’s power grid and other civilian infrastructure to “mask” his military failures, Wallace told reporters during a visit to a shipyard in Glasgow. He urged Ukrainians to “press the momentum to keep pushing Russia back”, adding: On the civil front, they’ve got to protect that national infrastructure that Putin is deliberately targeting in the hope that he wrecks their economy and it means they struggle very greatly during the winter. Targeting civilian infrastructure is illegal under international law, he said, adding that the UK is “not going to let that type of bullying and brutality be successful”. Despite recent signs of Moscow’s failures, such as the withdrawal from Kherson and the firing of a slew of Russian commanders, Wallace warned against underestimating the Russian leader. He said: Russia is a country that at the moment does not care about its own people and which young men it sends to their deaths, and it will just keep on pushing those people in. Mediazone, an independent Russian website founded by two of the people who started the protest group Pussy Riot, has published an account written by a soldier in the 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade in the Russian army. They claim that the brigade has had 900 casualties in fighting near Pavlivka, south-west of Donetsk. An open letter from the brigade has previously accused military leaders of the loss of 300 men. Now the new testimony, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, includes claims by an anonymous member of the brigade that 450-500 men were killed in three months of fighting. “Everyone is demoralised. Nobody is celebrating, because so many of our guys are dead. Personally, I lost four friends in just two days,” it says. The soldier says that despite the losses, generals won’t change tactics and have given medals out in an attempt to appease members of the brigade. The soldier adds: People are thinking of deserting, and I understand it, I am now contemplating the same idea. I have always served the motherland faithfully and used to condemn this kind of thinking, but now it is probably the only way we can stay alive. The US has donated 22,500 blankets for warming centres run by Ukraine’s railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, as temperatures plummet and millions are still without reliable access to power, the US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, said. The thermal blankets will be used at heating points at almost 100 railway stations across Ukraine, as part of a project implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin, who had hosted an inconsequential meeting of the warring countries’ leaders last month, comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) in Yerevan on Wednesday, Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Read the full story here: As attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continues, here’s our world affairs editor Julian Borger’s dispatch from Kyiv. Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Read more: More on the shelling in Kherson (see 12:21pm), where the governor of the region said that patients are being evacuated from the city’s hospitals because of bombardment by Russian forces. It comes on the same day that a hospital in Zaporizhzhia was damaged overnight. There were no injuries but dozens of windows have been broken Now Yaroslav Yanushevych has posted on his Telegram site: “Due to constant Russian shelling, we are evacuating hospital patients from Kherson.” Children at the Kherson regional clinical hospital will be transported to Mykoliav, and 100 patients at a Kherson regional psychiatric centre will now be treated in Odesa. The US space agency Nasa has released satellite images showing the extent of the energy crisis facing Ukraine following a barrage of Russian strikes on the country’s civilian infrastructure. Night-time satellite images taken from space on Wednesday show the majority of Ukraine in darkness, compared with neighbouring countries in Europe. My colleague Andrew Roth has more on President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine earlier today. He notes that one of the mothers in the behind-closed-doors meeting has two sons in active service, including a local police chief who threatened men who were dodging mobilisation that they wouldn’t be allowed to walk the streets if he returned. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide, a move that parliamentarians hope will serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and the conservative opposition leaders, will describe the 1932-1933 Holodomor as part of “a list of inhuman crimes by totalitarian systems that extinguished millions of human lives in Europe in the first half of the 20th century”. “People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were affected by hunger and repression”, the resolution will say. “This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide.” The victims of the Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – are traditionally commemorated in Ukraine on the last Saturday of November. Kyiv regards the historical event as part of a deliberate campaign by Stalin’s regime to collectivise agriculture and root out Ukraine’s fledging nationalist movement. Historians estimate between 4 and 7.5 million people were killed in the human-made disaster. Moscow has rejected Kyiv’s version of history, placing the deaths in the broader context of famines that devastated regions of Central Asia and Russia. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s national energy grid operator, Ukrenergo, has said the battle to restore power to homes is being slowed by “strong winds, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night”. In a statement on Facebook, the company said “more than 70% of the country’s consumption needs” were covered with priority given to critical infrastructure facilities. The statement continued: Reconnection of household consumers is ongoing. Difficult weather conditions are slowing the pace of reconnection: due to strong wind, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night, icing and broken wires in distribution (oblenergo) networks are added to the damage caused by russian missiles. Repair crews are working “around the clock to eliminate damage” following Russian targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure, it added. Vladimir Putin has met with mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, telling them that he had no regrets about launching his “special military operation” and said he shared in their suffering. In a pre-recorded meeting broadcast on state media, the president told the soldiers’ mothers not to believe everything they see on television or read on the internet, claiming there were many “fakes” circulating about the conflict. Sitting with the group of mothers around a table with tea, cakes and bowls of fresh berries, Putin said he and the entire Russian leadership understood and shared the pain of those who had lost their sons fighting in Ukraine. Putin said: I would like you to know that, that I personally, and the whole leadership of the country – we share your pain. He added: We understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son – especially for a mother. We share this pain. He said he had no regrets about launching what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” against Ukraine, casting the war as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to western hegemony. The mothers’ comments to the president were not immediately shown in the recorded television clip. German MPs are set to approve a motion to recognise the Holodomor, the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33, as a genocide, German media is reporting. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the resolution on Wednesday as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter due to Moscow’s invasion. The Holodomor should “join the list of inhumane crimes committed by totalitarian systems, in the course of which millions of human lives were wiped out in Europe, especially in the first half of the 20th century”, reads the draft text of the motion, seen by the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The draft text continues: People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were impacted by hunger and repression. This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide. Ukraine has labelled the Stalin-era famine as a genocide, an assertion rejected by the Kremlin, and interpretations of the famine’s causes have caused friction between the two countries. Robin Wagener, of Germany’s Green party, one of the resolution’s initiators, said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, operated in the cruel and criminal tradition of Stalin”. He told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: Once more, the basis for life in Ukraine is meant to be taken away through violence and terror, and the entire country brought to heel. Calling the Holodomor a genocide was intended as a “message of warning” to Moscow, he added. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, welcomed “very much that there is a lot of support in the German parliament” for the motion, a spokesperson told reporters. Just days after families reunited in liberated Kherson, residents of the southern Ukrainian city are being forced to flee due to Russian shelling from across the river. Kristina Berdynskykh, a Ukrainian journalist, says her relatives in Kherson urgently left following “heavy shelling” last night and this morning. Moscow has begun to “take revenge” on Kherson and its people “for not accepting the occupation”, she writes. Here’s more from the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, who spoke about the videos circulating on social media appearing to show Ukrainian soldiers executing Russian prisoners of war. Preliminary analysis of the videos indicate they were “highly likely to be authentic”, Türk said in a statement. He called on both Russia and Ukraine to issue clear instructions to their forces about the treatment of prisoners of war, adding that all allegations of summary executions should be investigated fully. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has travelled to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise the UK’s support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. He presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have killed at least 77 civilians since October and have plunged millions of people into extreme hardship, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, has said. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. In a statement, Türk said: Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes. Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Harry Taylor. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Germany said on Friday it was discussing with its allies Poland’s demand to send German Patriot air defence units to Ukraine, Reuters reports. “We are talking with our allies about how to handle Poland’s … suggestion,” a German government spokesperson told reporters in Berlin. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Friday that it was up to individual governments as to whether they supplied Ukraine with the Patriot systems (see 9.53am). As the time approaches 1pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a roundup of today’s updates so far. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight. The region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said there has been no injuries, but dozens of windows have been broken. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if things continue, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine. Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.” The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Half of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is still without power. Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to destroy the country’s power infrastructure. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there will be “no lasting peace” if Russia wins in Ukraine. He said Nato will continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Zelenskiy, said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” Zelenskiy also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Ten people were killed and 54 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said that his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Stoltenberg backed their membership in a press conference on Friday. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needed through the winter. Cleverly is visiting Ukraine and is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. Its chief executive, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. “Now the energy system is fully integrated, all regions are connected. It is again connected to the energy system of the European Union … All three nuclear power plants located in the unoccupied territory are working … In one to two days, they will reach their normal planned capacity, and we expect that it will be possible to return to scheduled power outages instead of emergency ones,” Kudrytskyi said during a nationwide telethon on Thursday evening, Ukrinform reports. A missile attack on 23 November meant that Ukraine lost power from nuclear, thermal, and hydroelectric generators. Kudrytskyi encouraged Ukrainians to save energy where possible. Further to our updates from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s press conference earlier (see 9.17am), he also told reporters that the decision over whether to send more air defence units to Ukraine was up to member states. Poland has asked Germany to send the US Patriot systems to Ukraine. He said they were “national decisions”, Reuters reports, adding that some agreements meant that consultation with allies was needed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. “There is no split, there is no schism among Europeans and we have to preserve this. This is our mission number one this year,” Zelenskiy said in an address via a live video link to a conference in Lithuania. “Europe is helping itself. It’s not helping Ukraine to stand against Russia, this is helping Europe to stand against Russian aggression”, he added, according to Reuters. European Union governments remained split on Thursday over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for the war, and Zelenskiy called on the EU leaders to settle on the lowest proposal of $30. “The price cuts are very important. We hear about (proposals to set the cap per barrel at) $60 or $70. Such words sound more like a concession (to Russia)“, Zelenskiy said. “But I’m very grateful to our Baltic and Polish colleagues for their proposals, quite reasonable ones, to set this camp at $30 a barrel. It’s a much better idea”, he added. Our correspondent in Ukraine, Isobel Koshiw has visited Kherson, the recently recaptured city in the south of the country, which faced heavy shelling last night. She has tweeted: “Kherson was shelled very heavily last night by Russian troops stationed on the eastern bank. According to Kherson’s head, Yanushevych, 10 people died and 54 were badly injured as a result. “The initial euphoria was (inevitably) going to fade. But the amount of incoming increased every day and there were more people leaving the city. There was a sharp drop in atmosphere. “The city is/was relatively intact. But if Russia wants to turn it into Kharkiv 2, where every 3rd-4th building is damaged, they could. Their frontline is just across the river. “Though in the case of Kherson, there are even lower prospects that shelling the city will result in any kind of victory or advance for Russia.” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking at a press conference this morning, ahead of a foreign ministers’ meeting in Romania next week. Stoltenberg said it would continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. “Nato will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not back down,” he told reporters in Brussels. “Many wars end in negotiations, but what happens at the negotiating table depends on what happens on the battlefield.” He added that there was “no lasting peace” if Russia won, and also said Finland and Sweden should be welcomed as “fully fledged” members of the alliance. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has tweeted this photograph of him meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday morning. The BBC has interviewed Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, Olena Zelenska, where she refers to the long road ahead for Ukrainians amid the Russian invasion. She compared the situation to a foot race, saying: “You know, it is easy to run a marathon when you know how many kilometres there are,” but adding that unlike a marathon, the Ukrainian war effort is indeterminable. “Sometimes it can be very difficult. But there are some new emotions that help us to hold on.” Zelenska also talked of the difficulty she faced because of the separation from her husband. The Russian forces had designated Zelenskiy and his family as targets. “I live separately with my children and my husband lives at work,” she said. “Most of all, we miss simple things – to sit, not looking at the time, as long as we want.” Speaking to the BBC’s chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, for the broadcaster’s 100 Women season, Zelenska said the Ukrainians are determined to fight on. “We all understand that without victory, there will be no peace. It would be a false peace and wouldn’t last long.” The UK’s foreign secretary is visiting Ukraine today. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has this. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, travelled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. With Kyiv under regular bombardment, his visit, which follows a trip to the Ukrainian capital by Rishi Sunak on Saturday, was conducted with a high level of security. The new Conservative leadership is eager to reassure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Boris Johnson’s departure from No 10 will not lead to waning levels of British moral, military and financial support. Cleverly said: “As winter sets in, Russia is continuing to try and break Ukrainian resolve through its brutal attacks on civilians, hospitals and energy infrastructure. Russia will fail.” It’s just gone 9.30am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where some of its residents have woken up without electricity. Last night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to take out the country’s power infrastructure. Kyiv’s major, Vitali Klitschko, told citizens that energy companies would try to get electricity back on for customers on a three-hour rotating basis. He said that half of the city is still without power. The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The soldiers are likely to have had heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while they were under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine, which has lasted nine months so far. Forbes reports: This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy. In 2021, all budget revenues of Russia amounted to $340bn. That is, the Russian Federation has already spent a quarter of last year’s revenues on military operations. If in the spring such costs could look quite acceptable, considering that the Russian Federation received about $1bn a day for oil and gas. Now the situation is different. The revenues of the federal budget of the Russian Federation from the export of oil and gas are decreasing – Russia has already lost most of the European gas market after the Nord Stream supply was cut off. Sanctions on Russian oil will begin in December. Oil prices rose in Asia on Friday after a week marked by worries about Chinese demand and haggling over a western price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reports. Brent crude futures rose by 28 cents, or 0.33%, to trade at $85.62 a barrel at 0410 GMT. G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing levels for a Russian price cap of between $65 and $70 a barrel, with the aim of limiting revenue to fund Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets. “The market considers (the price caps) too high which reduces the risk of Moscow retaliating,” ANZ Research analysts said in a note to clients. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow will not supply oil and gas to any countries that join in imposing the price cap, which the Kremlin reiterated on Thursday. Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on 5 December when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on 4 December. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. He wrote: The enemy again attacked the suburbs of Zaporizhzhia. This time the rockets hit near the hospital. Fortunately, people were not injured, the same cannot be said about the building. Dozens of broken windows. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Financial Times that this week’s strikes had created a situation not seen for 80 or 90 years: “A country on the European continent where there was totally no light.” By early Thursday evening, officials said a reactor at one nuclear plant, Khmelnytskyi, had been reconnected to the grid. The vast Zaporizhzhia plant in Russian-held territory was reconnected on Thursday, Ukrainian nuclear power company Energoatom said. This is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest as it happens for the next while. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. On Thursday night, more than 24 hours after Russian strikes had devastated Kyiv’s infrastructure, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said 60% of homes were still suffering emergency outages. Water services had been fully restored however, said city officials. Here are the other key recent developments: Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expected the three nuclear power plants would be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” Zelenskiy also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Seven people were killed and 21 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said that his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needed through the winter. Cleverly is visiting Ukraine and is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T14:44:41Z","webTitle":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. “Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes,” said Türk in a statement. “Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, did not deny that Russia was attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure but blamed Kyiv on the grounds it had not bowed to Russian demands, which he did not specify. Zelenskiy’s government has vowed not to accept peace terms that leave Russia in control of any Ukrainian territory. In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said the attacks would not break the will of the Ukrainian population. “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one,” he said. The three nuclear power stations still under Ukrainian control were back in operation after an unprecedented complete shutdown on Wednesday. However, Petro Kotin, the head of the state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, told the Guardian that defects in turbogenerators meant that two reactors were not yet rejoined the power grid. Kotin did not say where the two affected reactors were. Kotin said that in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which remains under Russian control, two of the six reactors were in standby mode, but had not yet been returned to the grid. Russian forces have continued to shell the southern city of Kherson two weeks after withdrawing their troops to the other side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian citizens being evacuated from the city because of the complete destruction of electricity, heat and water systems, have come under artillery fire as they attempt to leave. According to the Ukrainian presidency, 11 people were killed and nearly 50 injured in the Kherson region on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/09/kakhovka-dam-ukraine-donald-trump-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T15:48:19Z","webTitle":"After the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, another threat lies on Ukraine’s horizon: Donald Trump | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/kakhovka-dam-ukraine-donald-trump-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/kakhovka-dam-ukraine-donald-trump-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"After the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, another threat lies on Ukraine’s horizon: Donald Trump","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The war for Ukraine gets darker and more terrifying, and now a new front has opened up many miles away – in a US Republican party whose biggest players are itching to abandon Ukraine to its fate. Proof of the conflict’s deepening horror came this week, with the destruction on Tuesday of the Kakhovka dam in Russian-controlled Ukraine, releasing a body of water so massive it’s best imagined not as a reservoir but as a great lake. The result has been the flooding of a vast swath of terrain, forcing thousands to abandon their homes and flee for their lives. But the menaces unleashed by this act go further than the immediate and devastating effect on the people who live close by. For one thing, this calamity has hit a region of rich and fertile farmland, the same soil that long made Ukraine a breadbasket for the world: the fifth-largest exporter of wheat on the planet, the food source on which much of Africa and the Middle East has relied. Now there are warnings that the fields of southern Ukraine could “turn into deserts” by next year, because the water held back by the dam and needed to irrigate those fields is draining away. That will have an impact on food supplies and food prices, with an effect in turn on inflation and the global economy. Not that the international impact can be measured in dollars and cents alone. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that contaminated floodwaters now carry with them sewage, oil, chemicals and even anthrax from animal burial sites. That toxic material will, said the Ukrainian president, poison rivers and, before long, the water basin of the Black Sea. “So it’s not happening somewhere else. It is all interrelated in the world.” Meanwhile, the Red Cross has sounded an alarm of its own: the bursting of the dam does grievous damage to its ongoing effort to locate and clear landmines in the area. “We knew where the hazards were,” the organisation lamented. “Now we don’t know. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream.” Dislodged by the racing waters, those devices are now floating mines. And that’s before you reckon with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, which relies on water from the now-draining reservoir for the essential process of cooling. Small wonder that Zelenskiy speaks of “an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” while others now mention Kakhovka in the same breath as Chornobyl. Except few believe this was an accident. Naturally, Moscow insists that this was not a Russian act: it says the Ukrainians did this to themselves. Still, and even though investigations are ongoing, it’s worth heeding the advice of the specialist in Ukrainian history Timothy Snyder, and remembering the fundamentals of detective work. “Russia had the means,” Snyder notes, in that Russia was in control of the relevant part of the dam when it appeared to explode. Russia had the motive, in that it fears a Ukrainian counteroffensive aimed at taking back territory – and flooded ground is ground over which tanks cannot advance. And there is the pattern of behaviour, the record of past crimes. Russia has scarcely restrained itself from targeting Ukraine’s civil infrastructure over the last 15 months: Kakhovka would just be the latest and most wanton example. Indeed, the destruction of dams to trigger mass flooding is no more than Russia’s ultra-nationalist talking heads and TV pundit class have been demanding for a while. This week one such voice suggested Moscow give the Kyiv dam the Kakhovka treatment and that it “raze the city to the ground”. As if weighing up the moral implications, he asked, “Why should we be holier than the pope?” The official denials should not be taken too seriously, given the Kremlin’s history of disinformation and outright lies. Better to judge Russia by its deeds than its words. So what did Russia do to help those made desperate by the floods? The answer was swift and it came from Russian artillery units, seemingly firing on Ukrainian rescue workers and evacuees as they tried to flee to safety. It’s a strategy familiar from Moscow’s war in Syria: pile pain upon pain, misery upon misery. Supporters of Ukraine say that this is a sign of Russian weakness, that it is resorting to barbaric methods because it knows that, in key respects, Ukraine has the upper hand – not least because it enjoys the support of a united west. That is true, for now. But there is a threat from within the alliance’s most powerful member. Freshly indicted though he is, Donald Trump remains the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president. And Trump is a well-documented friend of Vladimir Putin and a sceptic on the merits of continued US support for Kyiv. When asked on CNN last month, the former president couldn’t say who he wants to prevail in the contest between Russia and Ukraine, between invader and invaded. Nor would he commit to supplying aid to Kyiv: “We don’t have ammunition for ourselves, we’re giving away so much.” Asked about war crimes charges against Putin – centred on the alleged mass abduction of Ukrainian children and their transfer across the border to be “re-educated” as Russians – Trump again refused to condemn the “smart guy” in the Kremlin. Because Trump has remade the Republican party in his own image, this is not a danger confined to him alone. His nearest current rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, echoed Moscow talking points in March when he referred to the war as a “territorial dispute”, a remark he later sought to undo. But the window into his thinking had been opened. Most Republicans in Congress still back Ukraine, but the right of the party has moved into a different place, one illuminated by Tucker Carlson’s debut Twitter show this week, his first since his firing by Fox News. There he described Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, as “sweaty and rat-like … a persecutor of Christians … shifty, dead-eyed”, suggesting without evidence, and in a perfect echo of Moscow, that the hand of Kyiv lay behind the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. We already knew that much is at stake in the November 2024 presidential election, not least the life expectancy of US democracy. But there is something else, too. Ukraine is engaged in a profound battle for its own survival as an independent nation, and for larger principles essential to the whole world: that freedom must prevail, and that aggression must not. Ukraine cannot win that fight alone. It cannot win only with the backing of its European neighbours, which, though necessary, is not sufficient. It requires the United States, its muscle and its money. The plight of Kherson and the indictment in Miami are linked: the world desperately needs the defeat of Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the Russian-occupied complex in south-eastern Ukraine. A team of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s frontlines. Speaking on national television, she said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region, and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy Bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of president Vladimir Putin, said in a French television interview on Friday that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions, but warned Moscow would not stop its assault until its goals had been achieved. “Renouncing (Ukraine’s) participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace,” Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive had stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Alexander Lukashenko said he had previously agreed to the move with his Russian counterpart, Putin, and warned that his country was ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%.

Here’s where we stand: The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Ukrainian leader said Ukrainians would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies are “quickened, specifically long range weapons”. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and “hit the trade and technology that supports [Russia’s] war against Ukraine”. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders that they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week it would send to Ukraine. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz’s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany’s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003. Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden in which Stockholm would provide air defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany’s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said. Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Joe Biden for the new US military aid package, which includes a new rocket that will double Ukraine’s strike range for the first time in its war with Russia. The greater Ukraine’s long-range weapons capacity, and the more mobile its troops, the sooner Russia’s brutal aggression will end, Zelenskiy posted to Twitter. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. In a statement after a call between France’s defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, and his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, the ministry said: This will allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russian drones, missiles and plane attacks, through the coverage of a significant part of the Ukrainian territory. It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said yesterday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system, known as Mamba, to Ukraine on Kyiv’s request, to help protect the country’s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. A new US military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $2.175bn includes a new rocket that would double Ukraine’s strike range, according to a US official. The Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) will be provided to Ukraine as part of Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), Brig Gen Patrick Ryder told a news briefing. The GLSDB’s range is 94 miles (151 km), double that of Ukraine’s current longest-range weapon, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), whose rockets can travel 48 miles (77 km). A greater range would allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war, attacking Russian forces from a greater distance or potentially penetrating more deeply into Russian-held territory. The GLSDB will put all of Russia’s supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea. It will force Russia to move its supplies farther from the frontlines, which could make its soldiers more vulnerable and complicate plans for any new offensive. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said new tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Reznikov said: The new tank coalition with the main tanks of Nato countries - we need this for the counteroffensive, we will use it like an iron fist to break through their defensive lines. Błaszczak, who is in Kyiv for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, said Warsaw was helping to train Ukrainian soldiers to use western tanks and that completing the training was a question of “weeks not days or months”. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting today to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. It follows a $60 per-barrel cap imposed on Russian crude on 5 December. The EU’s 10th package of sanctions against Russia will hit the trade and technology that supports its war against Ukraine, according to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch has the full list: It’s nearly 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Ukrainian leader said Ukrainians would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies are “quickened, specifically long range weapons”.

The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Ursula von der Leyen said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components, as well as measures to counter circumvention of sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea have said they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev has handed “some digital material” to police, Norway’s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. He remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, it added. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete. Instead, it will consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Tony Estanguet, has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the European Union to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Ukraine’s president was speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, who lead the European Commission and European Council respectively. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. We would like some of the states, European states who still don’t want to impose sanctions against Rosatom, the top managers of Rosatom… the nuclear power for them to understand what if their children were just taken, put into buses and forcefully taken to the Russian Federation. For this forced deportation you need to enforce sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Russia has provided Hungary with a €10bn loan to expand a nuclear power plant with Russian nuclear reactors. Last week the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán said extending sanctions to nuclear power “obviously needs to be vetoed”. All EU sanctions must be passed unanimously by the bloc’s 27 member states. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, von der Leyen said the EU’s 10th package of sanctions would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components. The package will also include measures to counter circumvention of sanctions, she said. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has tweeted a clip of his recent joint press conference with Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian people have made “a clear choice for freedom, democracy, and rule of law”, Michel said. He continues: We in the EU have also made a clear decision. Your future is with us in our common European Union. Your destiny is our destiny. At the joint press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen said there were goals for Ukraine to meet as part of its EU membership push. Asked about Ukraine’s accession drive, she said: There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a news conference with top European Union officials, Zelenskiy said: Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress. Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas “if it received long-range weapons”, Zelenskiy added. He said: If weapons (supplies) are quickened, specifically long range weapons, we not only will not leave Bakhmut, but we will also begin to deoccupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014. The city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region has become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance and of intense efforts by Moscow to regain battlefield momentum. Russian officials have said its forces are encircling Bakhmut from several directions and battling to take control of a road which is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces. Zelenskiy said Russia would continue to push in the east, but that Ukrainian forces would be able to hold out until more western weapons arrived. Air raid sirens have sounded in Kyiv, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Here are some of the most recent images sent over the news wires from Kherson in Ukraine. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that at least one person has been killed by shelling in Donetsk. It posted to its official Telegram channel: Russian troops shelled the centre of Toretsk in Donetsk region: one person was killed, six were injured. Kurakhivka was also shelled from artillery, three people were injured, the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Traders are using Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia to evade EU sanctions on Russia, a tactic that breaches these countries’ compliance with the bloc’s embargo, Latvia’s prime minister said on Friday. Krisjanis Karins made the assertion after talks with counterparts from the EU member states Estonia and Lithuania, which along with Latvia have been among the most vocal supporters of sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “It seems quite clear that traders are finding ways to legally trade goods, say with Turkey, Kazakhstan or Armenia, which are then re-sent to Russia, because these countries are not adhering to the sanctions regime,” Reuters says Karins told reporters in Talinn, the Estonian capital. Back with the Olympics for a moment, the Associated Press is reporting that the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, but instead at its extraordinary general assembly held today, it approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The committee members voted for “consultations on preventing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions and a possible boycott”. Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians. The last multinational boycott of an Olympics was in 1998, when North Korea were joined by Cuba, Ethiopia and Nicaragua in boycotting the Seoul Olympics in South Korea. The first task is to wipe off or cover up the Z, says Anatoly, 44, of the call sign infamously daubed on Russian hardware involved in the war in Ukraine. “We don’t want friendly fire later on.” Then the mechanics get to work. In a secret location in Ukraine, within a vast warehouse that could be mistaken for a tank graveyard, what was once Russian – Soviet, in many cases – is being turned Ukrainian. All the headlines have recently been made by the decision of Germany and a host of others to supply Ukraine with western heavy armour: Leopard 2s, Challengers and Abrams. The names have become familiar and they may have the technical cutting-edge and firepower to turn the course of the Ukraine war, when they arrive and if in sufficient numbers. But for all the efforts of the Nato allies, it is Russia that is unwittingly, and yet by some margin, Ukraine’s biggest donor of tanks today. Oryx, the open-source Dutch intelligence defence analysis website, has collected photographs of 546 captured Russian tanks. It will be just a fraction of the total haul of tanks that were either abandoned by the fleeing Russian forces or seized in bloody battle. Read the full story here: The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Tony Estanguet told Reuters he was “in favour of maintaining this symbol of universality for the Games” when asked about Russian and Belarusian participation. The decision rested with the Games’ governing body, he added. Estanguet said: It’s not in the charge of Paris 2024 to decide who is allowed to participate, it’s about the IOC, it’s about the IPC, it’s about the international federations who will decide which delegations will be allowed to participate. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the IOC to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the 2024 Paris Games. Allowing them to take part would be tantamount to showing that “terror is somehow acceptable”, Zelenskiy has said. On Thursday, sports ministers from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland called on international sports bodies to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the Olympics and other events while the war in Ukraine continues. Poland’s sport and tourism minister, Kamil Bortniczuk, told Reuters he believed it would be possible to build a coalition of about 40 countries, including the US, Britain and Canada, supporting the call to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics. Here’s some more detail on the news that Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said in a statement that his office has served “a notice of suspicion to the head of the private military company ‘Wagner’”, without identifying Prigozhin by name. He added: The head of this group is directly responsible for thousands of war crimes. He openly admits his role in the war against Ukraine and, with the Kremlin’s permission, resolves staff issues by recruiting tens of thousands of prisoners. Under Ukraine’s criminal code, suspects in criminal cases must be informed in a “notice of suspicion”. Kostin listed accusations against Wagner, including encroachment on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and waging an aggressive war. He added that Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. He added: I am certain together with international partners we will ensure comprehensive responsibility both for every criminal who came to our land with weapons in his hands and also for their patrons who do business in blood. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine earlier this week, saying his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said his country “really needs” planes and long-range missiles “to destroy the military infrastructure of the Russian occupying forces” in occupied territories of Ukraine. He said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Asked about Scholz’s role, Kuleba said the issue of jets “is far from Germany”. He said: Why was the position of Germany and Chancellor Scholz important regarding Leopard tanks? It is a [mass-produced] tank, but it is German technology, so Germany’s word was key. In the issue of aircraft, Germany’s word is not key, because it is American technology. Among the blizzard of announcements aimed at showing the EU’s support for Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe is “bringing light to Ukraine”. Von der Leyen has confirmed the EU will supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said he was “grateful” to Von der Leyen. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell wrote on social media. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, announced the programme after meeting with Borrell in Kyiv yesterday, posting to Telegram that it was an “important component of our recovery, which will allow us to return normal life”. Norway has confirmed it will order 54 new German-made Leopard 2 tanks for its army from the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Group, with an option to buy a further 18 tanks at a later time. Speaking at a news conference, the Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre said: We ensure that we have the same tanks as our Nordic neighbours and many key Nato allies. This “further strengthens our relationship with Germany”, he added. Norway, which shares a 196km (122-mile) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to either order German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the Korean-produced K2 Black Panther. Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev, who had previously told the Guardian he feared for his life and that he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters, has handed “some digital material” to police, Norway’s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. The material was being examined, it added. Medvedev remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, Kripos said, adding that he “gives the impression that he wants to continue to say more” about his time with Wagner. Medvedev is the first known soldier from the Wagner group who fought in Ukraine to flee abroad. Security arrangements have also been made for Medvedev’s safety, “both visible and non-visible” measures, Kripos added. European Council president Charles Michel is in Kyiv, along with the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and 15 European commissioners to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for what they describe as a summit meeting. The highly symbolic visit is the first EU political mission of its kind to a country at war, and comes as the bloc prepares to adopt a 10th package of sanctions against Russia. “There will be no let-up in our resolve,” Michel tweeted as he arrived in the Ukrainian capital. He added: We will also support you every step of the way on your journey to the EU. Germany has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit has said. Hebestreit confirmed “an export licence has been issued” for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details. Süddeutsche Zeitung had reported that the German government approved German arms maker Rheinmetall’s plans to sell 88 of the older Leopards to Ukraine for a total cost of more than €100m. Deliveries of the older Leopard 1 tanks from the industrial stocks could be made as soon as the tanks are repaired, the paper writes. However, there are still problems in obtaining the required 105-millimetre ammunition, it writes. It comes after the German government announced it would send 14 Leopard 2 main battle tanks from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine. Berlin is also considering buying back 15 Gepard tanks it had sold to Qatar, the German newspaper reported. It said several German officials had discussed with Qatar’s foreign ministry the possible purchase of Gepard tanks that Doha had bought to secure the World Cup stadiums. The paper quoted Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying: The Gepards have proven themselves very well in the war in Ukraine. If we could get more from partners here, that would definitely help the Ukrainians. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Top EU officials are due to meet on Friday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for ‘a summit meeting’. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion. EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine’s expectations of a fast track to membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy’s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Zelenskiy called on Thursday for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but sanctions being prepared by the bloc for the anniversary will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president’s comments on Friday, saying: “Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.” The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin’s war machine. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not “fully protected yet”. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not ‘fully protected yet’. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass quotes him as saying: Donbas is not fully protected yet, so a special military operation continues. Actually, we must protect the people who live there until this goal is fully achieved. This remains to be done. Peskov went on to say that “the security of Crimea is ensured reliably”. Russia claimed to annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 in a move not widely recognised by the international community. The air alert that has been in force across Ukraine for nearly the last two hours has ended, the state broadcaster Suspilne reports. Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. “We note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally binding obligations, including on inspection, and call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty,” Reuters reports Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a tweet. The main event in Kyiv today is that top European Union officials are due to meet Friday in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for what they described as a summit meeting. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion. Susie Blann at Associated Press writes that the last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 — a few months before Russia’s latest incursion into Ukraine. Since then, assistance for Ukraine from the EU has reached almost €50bn (£44.6bn / $55bn) since the fighting started. The EU is providing Ukraine with financial and humanitarian aid and plans to adopt a 10th package of sanctions again Russia in the coming weeks – the pace of which has been criticised by Zelenskiy. Ukraine wants to join the 27-nation bloc on an accelarated timescale, though it could take years. In the meantime, von der Leyen said Thursday that the European Commission is willing to let Kyiv join what she called some “key European programs” that will bring benefits similar to membership. Those programs were due to be discussed in Friday’s meeting, which will also address one of the main obstacles to Ukraine’s EU membership: accusations of endemic corruption. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Reuters reports the Nordic Nato member, which shares a 196 km (122 miles) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to choose either German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the rival Korean-produced K2 Black Panther. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday that they had nationalised around 500 properties in the peninsula including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said that the decree targeted “accomplices of the Kyiv regime” and that the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Reuters reports that according to a document published on a Crimean government website, properties belonging to former Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and businessmen Igor Kolomoisky, Rinat Akhmetov and Serhiy Taruta were among those confiscated. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, has been controlled by Moscow since 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed the peninsula. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. The Ukrinform website reports that the statement was published in the Uriadovyi Kuryer government gazette. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine (Article 110 part 3 of the criminal code of Ukraine) and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine (Article 437 [art 2). In a grim video released over new year, Prigozhin – a long-term ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front in Ukraine filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city of Bakhmut, a key Russian objective. There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is quoting Vladimir Rogov, leader of the pro-Russian We are together with Russia movement in occupied Ukraine. He reported on Telegram: “It’s loud in Enerhodar. The cause of the explosion that sounded this morning in the city was a car explosion. According to preliminary data, one person died as a result of the terrorist attack. The fire has now been extinguished. Pyrotechnic teams are checking for the presence of explosives to prevent another explosion.” Enerhodar is the city adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, also posted to Telegram about the incident. He reported that the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to work for the occupying Russian authorities. Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. In his message, Orlov implied that the policemen had been targeted because of criminal and corrupt activities among the occupiers, writing: Since the beginning of March last year and until now, Enerhodar has been a city where the occupiers have been active in criminal activities: they torture and capture people, rob the city’s residents and entire businesses. But they put in their pockets a part of what they receive from the Russian Federation to provide for their needs. Living Rashists do not need … witnesses. Therefore, they will continue to carry out similar “cleanings”. And the first one has already left. None of the claims by either Rogov or Orlov have been independently verified. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, has posted to Telegram, responding to the Ukrainian president’s comments about the slowing down of western sanctions on Russia. She quotes the media saying “Zelenskiy complained that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down, and Russia has become faster to adapt to restrictions” and goes on to write: Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne offers this summary of the last 24 hours in its latest bulletin on Telegram. It writes: At night, the Russian military attacked the Barvinkove community in the Kharkiv region. A private house was destroyed and a 70-year-old man was rescued from the rubble. Two men died. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Kherson. They hit one of the shopping centres, a fire started there. People were not injured. Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region also came under fire. There are no dead or injured. Over the past 24 hours, one person was killed by Russian shelling in Donetsk region, and eight others were injured. In the Kherson region, two people were killed in a day, nine more were injured, among them a five-year-old child. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are two images sent over the news wires from Kramatorsk, showing search and rescue operations taking place yesterday. Three people died, eight people were hospitalised with injuries, including two who are in a serious condition, after a building was struck by a Russian missile. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports the latest status update from Ukraine’s regional authority in partially occupied Kherson, one of the areas the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Suspilne posted to its official Telegram channel: During the day of 2 February, the Russian occupiers shelled Kherson oblast 65 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, and tanks. Kherson – 13 times. They targeted a shipbuilding plant, a school and residential buildings. Two people died, nine were injured. Among the injured was a five-year-old boy. EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine’s expectations of a fast track to membership at a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday, as the bloc spars over how much encouragement to give its war-torn neighbour. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, are due to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday for wide-ranging talks on the war, further sanctions on Russia and integrating Ukraine into the EU’s internal market. It is understood that the EU leaders will seek in private to temper Ukraine’s expectations of a fast-tracked membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy’s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, told Politico his country had “a very ambitious plan to join the European Union within the next two years”. For this Friday’s must-read: Guardian correspondents have looked into how Putin’s plans to blackmail Europe over gas supply failed: The worst-case scenarios piled up over the summer months. Germany’s economic minister warned of “catastrophic” industrial shutdowns, fraying supply chains and mass unemployment. France’s president urged citizens to turn down the heating. Spain asked why countries that hadn’t got hooked on Russian gas should bail out neighbours who had lectured them about fiscal discipline in the past. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, gleefully predicted that Europeans would be “freezing in their homes” because they hadn’t thought through the consequences of throwing their support behind Ukraine. “The cold is coming soon,” he said, menacingly, in June last year. But as the European Union enters the last month of the meteorological winter in 2023, signs are becoming clearer that its members have weathered a historic crisis – and not just because “General Frost” has proved a milder adversary than Medvedev predicted. Within eight months of Russian troops setting foot on Ukrainian soil, the bloc of 27 European states replaced about 80% of the natural gas it used to draw through pipelines with Russia, by rapidly building up new infrastructure for liquid natural gas, finding creative ways to help each other out amid shortages, and successfully pursuing energy-saving policies. Read the full story at the link below: The US Central Intelligence Agency director, William Burns, said on Thursday that the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s ambitions toward Taiwan should not be underestimated, despite him likely being sobered by the performance of Russia’s military in Ukraine. Burns said the United States knew “as a matter of intelligence” that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of self-governed Taiwan by 2027. “Now, that does not mean that he’s decided to conduct an invasion in 2027, or any other year, but it’s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,” Burns told an event at Georgetown University in Washington. “Our assessment at CIA is that I wouldn’t underestimate President Xi’s ambitions with regard to Taiwan,” he said, adding that the Chinese leader was likely “surprised and unsettled” and trying to draw lessons by the “very poor performance” of the Russian military and its weapons systems in Ukraine. Ukraine’s allies are pushing the International Monetary Fund to finalise plans for a multibillion-dollar lending programme, the Financial Times reported on Friday. IMF representatives are planning to meet Ukrainian officials in mid-February to advance discussions over a loan that could range from $14bn to $16bn, the report said, citing officials familiar with the talks. European Union leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv today, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine’s hope for swift EU membership, Reuters reports. The head of the group’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv by train on Thursday, a symbolic journey to demonstrate support for Ukraine as the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February 2022 invasion approaches. Senior members of the EU’s executive met their counterparts in the Ukrainian government, and von der Leyen and the chairman of the 27 EU national leaders, Charles Michel, will convene talks with Zelenskiy on Friday. Zelenskiy called for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing for the anniversary will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelensky told a joint news conference alongside European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” “Russia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,” Von der Leyen said on Thursday. “By 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.” Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Our top story this morning: European Union leaders will meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine and its president’s hopes of swift EU membership. “Russia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,” Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. “By 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.” Here are the other key recent developments – including what has happened so far at the talks between EU leaders and Zelenskiy: The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. Speaking at the start of a two-day trip to Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated that the EU aimed to have a 10th package of sanctions against Russia in place by 24 February. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin’s war machine. The G7 and the EU have already agreed on a price cap on crude oil that came into force last December and, according to Von der Leyen, costs Russia €160m (£143m/$174m) a day. The EU’s 27 member states are yet to agree on the latest oil price cap. The EU also intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine to be located in The Hague, Von der Leyen said. The purpose of this centre was to collect and store evidence for any future trial, whether that took place via a special tribunal or some other way. The European parliament has voted in support of a roadmap for Ukraine’s accession to the EU. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said he wanted Ukraine to join the EU in two years, but in reality it was likely to take much longer. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the EU to impose more sanctions on Russia, and said he had discussed a new sanctions package with Von der Leyen. Zelenskiy said the speed of the EU sanctions campaign against Russia had “slightly slowed down” while Russia had been “increasing its pace of adapting to sanctions”. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require “months if not years” of training and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory. Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s defence minister. Speaking to French media, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia would call on a large contingent of mobilised troops. Referring to the general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September, he claimed that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. Russia has warned it has “the potential” to respond to western arms deliveries to Ukraine that will not just be about “using armoured vehicles”. In a speech marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory against Nazi Germany in the Battle of Stalingrad, Vladimir Putin appeared to allude to Russia’s enormous nuclear weapons arsenal, warning that “those who expect to win on the battlefield apparently do not understand that a modern war with Russia will be utterly different for them”. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia’s arms suppliers will “significantly” increase their deliveries of military hardware during this year. Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s powerful security council and oversees a government commission on arms production, said new supplies would help Russia inflict a “crushing defeat” over Ukraine on the battlefield. Two Russian missiles struck Kramatorsk on Thursday, after an apartment block in the eastern Ukrainian city was hit on Wednesday night, killing at least killing three people and injuring 20. The latest strikes resulted in civilian casualties, said the head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, but it was not clear how many. In addition, two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region. At least eight people died after a fire at a dormitory for construction workers in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, Russian officials said. The fire broke out in temporary accommodation for workers building the Tavrida highway, a road linking the cities of Sevastopol and Simferopol, according to the Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said everybody wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end, but that the west’s support for Kyiv was playing an important role in how Moscow approached the campaign. In an interview on Russia’s state TV, Lavrov also said Moscow had plans to overshadow pro-Ukrainian events arranged by western and allied countries around the world to mark the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A senior Russian lieutenant who fled after serving in Ukraine has described how his country’s troops tortured prisoners of war and threatened some with rape. “I have personally seen our troops torture Ukrainian soldiers,” Konstantin Yefremov, who is the most senior soldier to speak out against the war, told the Guardian in a phone call. “I feel relieved that I can finally speak out about the things I have seen.” A state-of-the-art missile defence system provided by Italy and France should be up and running in Ukraine within the next two months, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine, on Kyiv’s request, to help protect the country’s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said he is open to supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets if the decision is taken together with Nato allies. In an interview with Bild, he stressed that his assessment was “based on what Nato countries decide together” and that the decision required the “strategic consideration of the whole” alliance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-10T17:24:15Z","webTitle":"UK energy strategy’s nuclear dangers and glaring omissions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","fields":{"headline":"UK energy strategy’s nuclear dangers and glaring omissions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has “already been through some form of planning”. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn’t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views. Josie Bassinette Walberswick, Suffolk • In your major article on the government’s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations. Morag Carmichael London • In light of Boris’s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce’s so-called “mini-nukes” to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine. Bob Cannell Bradford • I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don’t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it’s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the “red tape” of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey • If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears. Jon Reeds Alston, Cumbria • A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas. Malcolm Scott Wirral • There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.

France’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, announced plans last week to take full control of the power group in an attempt to keep a handle on spiralling household electricity bills. The cost of buying the 16% of EDF shares that the government does not already own, plus any outstanding convertible bonds, could be as high as €10bn, Reuters reported. The reported move pushed EDF shares up by as much as 9.4% in early trading before later settling 6% higher at €10.26, valuing the company at €39.7bn. EDF, which is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, dominates the French electricity market, with the country reliant on it for nuclear power. EDF’s nuclear production accounted for 69% of France’s electricity supplies in 2021. However, this supply level is expected to slump to the lowest level in more than three decades this year due to a combination of maintenance, refuelling and repairs at 12 reactors across France. The French government is trying to reduce its reliance on overseas energy imports as Europe scrambles to keep the lights on this winter. There are growing concerns that Russia will not restart gas supplies into Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after maintenance started on Monday. It is due to conclude on 21 July. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, described a complete Russian gas cut-off as the “most likely scenario”. France procures about 17% of its gas from Russia but is not as badly affected by disruption to supplies as neighbours such as Germany. Le Maire also said EDF’s chairman and chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, who took the helm in 2014, will step down. Antonio Totaro, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said the nationalisation is “largely good news” for EDF and the company’s bondholders as it signals the state’s commitment. He said: “EDF has ambitious development plans in the nuclear industry, both in France and abroad – and this nationalisation announcement could be read in parallel with [French president Emmanuel] Macron’s nuclear renaissance aims.” In February, Macron said France would build at least six new nuclear reactors in the next few decades. In the UK, EDF shut down one unit at Hinkley Point B last week and another is due to close on 1 August. Hinkley Point C is not expected to be in operation until 2027 due to construction delays and EDF is awaiting a planning decision on the Sizewell C development in Suffolk, which was last week delayed to 20 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T16:40:33Z","webTitle":"We need to revive the UK’s nuclear industry | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"We need to revive the UK’s nuclear industry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A reply is needed to the letters (23 March) objecting to political parties supporting nuclear power. How can the chairman of the British Energy Efficiency Federation dispute the statement that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”? Has he not realised that, to meet the climate crisis, the necessary replacement of fossil fuels in road transport and home heating requires electric-powered engines and heat pumps, respectively? Safe underground storage of nuclear waste has been developed. This has never been an insoluble problem. By contrast, little money has been spent on other waste products such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals and plastics. In comparison with nuclear waste, the poisonous effects of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium never decay with time. We need both nuclear power and power from renewables, the long-term storage of which is a real problem. It is sad that the UK government’s abandonment of support for nuclear industry development in the 1990s has led to the import of expensive foreign reactors. Our country needs a revived nuclear industry based on smaller, much cheaper reactors that are faster to build. Opposition to nuclear power has led to much higher emissions of CO2; for the past 40 years, the emissions from France, whose electricity has been mainly nuclear-powered, have been about 30% less per head than those from Germany. The current abandonment of nuclear power in Germany has not made sense because it has led to more burning of coal and a reliance on imported Russian fuels.

Here’s where we stand: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi also dismissed calls to evacuate civilians from some cities worst hit by energy shortages as “inappropriate”. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police have raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution centre in the town of Orihiv in south-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 70 miles east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced. Zelenskiy said he was “grateful” and that the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added while speaking at a conference in Berlin. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said the US ambassador at large, Beth Van Schaack. Ukraine will summon the ambassador of Hungary to demand an apology after its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, appeared in public wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the foreign ministry said. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.” Ukrainian refugees in the UK are experiencing difficulties accessing private rented accommodation because they are unable to secure guarantors or references, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The World Health Organization has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. The WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. Canada has announced new sanctions against Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko’s administration for supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The foreign ministry said it would sanction 22 more Belarusian officials as well as 16 Belarusian companies involved in military manufacturing, technology, engineering, banking and railway transportation. The officials included some who were “complicit in the stationing and transport of Russian military personnel and equipment involved in the invasion of Ukraine”. In a statement, the Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly accused Lukashenko’s regime of “letting its territory serve as a launching pad for Russia’s egregious attacks against Ukraine”. By doing so, Belarus was “enabling the Russian regime’s human rights violations in places such as Bucha, Izium and Mariupol and contributing to the pain and suffering of millions around the globe that has resulted from President Putin’s weaponization of food and energy”, she continued. Russian-installed officials in the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said Russian air defences were activated after two drones were shot down. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Kremlin-installed governor of the Sevastopol, said on Telegram: There is an attack with drones. Our air defence forces are working right now. Two drones had “already been shot down”, he said. No civilian infrastructure had been damaged, he added, urging people to stay calm. Sevastopol is the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. In October, Russia blamed Ukraine for an attack on the port using air and marine drones. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. It said: The volume of gas supplied by Gazprom ... for transit to Moldova via Ukraine is more than the physical volume transmitted at the border of Ukraine with Moldova. It went on to say that would “begin reducing gas supply” on Monday 28 November if the “transit imbalance through Ukraine for Moldovan consumers persists”. The Ukraine pipeline is the last remaining pipeline still bringing Russian natural gas to western Europe after Gazprom shut off its flows via Nord Stream 1. Ukraine has denied the allegations, saying that all the gas volumes bound to Moldovan consumers have been transferred “in the full amount”. Officials from Iran and Ukraine have met to discuss allegations that Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones in Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson. Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged for the first time that it supplied Moscow with drones but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine. Russia denies its forces have used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine. Oleg Nikolenko told CNN: Such an expert meeting did take place. I cannot disclose the details, but I can assure you that the Ukrainian side continues to take the most drastic measures to prevent the use of Iranian weapons by Russia for the war against Ukraine. He added: Ukraine has informed Iran that the consequences of complicity in the Russian aggression will be incommensurable with the potential benefits of cooperation with Russia. Here are some images we have received from the frontline in Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainians are bracing for what is expected to be the hardest winter in the country’s history. The Ukrainian cold is coming and with it a nightmare for millions as they face it without electricity, water or heating. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens not to head into the woods without consulting the military, because Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells. But with the price of firewood rising, many have no choice but to take the risk. If a mine doesn’t kill them, the cold might. While people living in houses can burn wood – if they can get it – those who live in flats often rely on old Soviet centralised heating systems. The Russians have bombed many of the country’s thermal power plants, which used to pump hot water into the flats’ radiators. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi also dismissed calls to evacuate civilians from some cities worst hit by energy shortages as “inappropriate”. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police have raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution centre in the town of Orihiv in south-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 70 miles east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced. Zelenskiy said he was “grateful” and that the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added while speaking at a conference in Berlin. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said the US ambassador at large, Beth Van Schaack. Ukraine will summon the ambassador of Hungary to demand an apology after its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, appeared in public wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the foreign ministry said. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.” Ukrainian refugees in the UK are experiencing difficulties accessing private rented accommodation because they are unable to secure guarantors or references, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The World Health Organization has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. The WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The Japanese government has announced it will provide Ukraine with generators and solar lanterns as emergency grant aid worth an equivalent of $2.57m (£2.16m). In a statement, it said: The large-scale blackout has occurred in various areas of Ukraine caused by destruction of a large part of energy infrastructure facilities. While the winter gets colder and days get shorter every day in Ukraine, the aid has significant importance as winterisation support for those who cannot use heating facilities and lighting equipment due to the blackout. Japan will continue to “support and stand by” the people of Ukraine “who are facing hardship”, it added. Perched as it is in an upmarket neighbourhood overlooking the scenic Vondelpark, it is not hard to imagine why a Russian billionaire would have been interested in the 1879 five-storey Amsterdam property with a lush private garden. That billionaire was Arkady Volozh, a co-founder of Russia’s biggest search engine, Yandex. He bought the £3m house in 2019, becoming one of the dozens of wealthy Russians who have invested in property in the Dutch capital. But since October, the mansion, which had been undergoing extensive refurbishment, has been taken over by a group of squatters, who issued a statement saying they had done so in a protest against Volozh’s reported ties to the Kremlin, and the wider housing crisis in Amsterdam. Last Wednesday, a Dutch court ruled the squatters did not have to vacate the property. When the Guardian visited the house, it was hung with banners criticising the war in Ukraine. The Guardian was refused entry to the apartment by one of the squatters, who declined to give her name, citing security issues. Lighting a cigarette, the squatter said she was relieved by the judge’s verdict. “The law is finally on our side,” she smiled. Read the full story here: A video message recorded by the Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate, Oleksandra Matviichuk, has been beamed on to the building of the Red Bull Formula One racing headquarters outside London, appealing to the world champion driver Max Verstappen to use his influence to persuade Red Bull to pull out of Russia. Unlike many global brands, Red Bull has refused to cut ties with Putin’s Russia and the energy drink is still on sale in supermarkets across the country. She said: This is a message to Max Verstappen and all Red Bull athletes. My name is Oleksandra Matviichuk, I am a Ukrainian human rights defender and head of the Centre for Civil Liberties. I know that driving a Formula One racing car is dangerous, but for millions of people it’s very dangerous just to be in Ukraine. I am in Kyiv and we, like other Ukrainian cities, are constantly being shelled by Russian rockets. Max, you are a leading brand ambassador of Red Bull. Can you please ask them: why is Red Bull still on sale in Russia while so many global brands have pulled out? Why do Red Bull still continue to help Russia to finance this war? I ask for your support to convince Red Bull to stop their business in Russia. I do believe that Red Bull must abandon Russian money but not people. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. In a seven-and-a-half minute recording of the call posted on the internet by Russian comedians Vovan and Lexus, Polish president Andrzej Duda can be heard speaking in English to the caller, who attempts to put on a French accent. The call, the second time in recent years that the pranksters from Russia have succeeded in getting through to Duda, came on an evening when the world feared that the conflict in Ukraine could spill beyond its borders, Reuters reported. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.” Duda’s office wrote on Twitter: After the missile explosion in Przewodow, during the ongoing calls with heads of state and government, a person claiming to be French president Emmanuel Macron was connected. During the call, President Andrzej Duda realised from the unusual way the interlocutor conducted the conversation that there might have been an attempted hoax attempt and ended the conversation. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. Speaking at a conference in Berlin hosted by the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Scholz said: In view of the development of the war and Russia’s visible and growing failures ... we must be ready for an escalation. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added. Scholz visited China earlier this month to meet its president, Xi Jinping, a trip he said was worth it alone for spelling out the two countries’ joint stance against using nuclear weapons. In the first visit by a G7 leader to China since the Covid pandemic, Scholz pressed Xi to prevail on Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine. In a readout of the meeting by Chinese state media, Xi agreed that both leaders “jointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons” over Ukraine, though he refrained from criticising Russia or calling on Moscow to withdraw its troops. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has claimed Russia is preparing for a second round of mobilisation in January, with plans to draft up to 700,000 reservists. Moscow called up more than 300,000 soldiers to fight in Ukraine in September, a move that prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being conscripted. In a tweet, Gerashchenko said – without providing evidence – that those 300,000 men who had already been drafted had been killed, wounded or demoralised. The Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters yesterday that it was not discussing calling up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was “grateful” to the EU and the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, after she announced a further €2.5bn in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. Ukrainian refugees in the UK are experiencing difficulties accessing private rented accommodation because they are unable to secure guarantors or references, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The ONS surveyed nearly 3,000 Ukrainians who fled Russia’s invasion of their country to live in the UK under two visa schemes. The assessment looked at opinions and experiences of those arriving in the UK under the family and “homes for Ukraine” sponsorship schemes. The schemes allow Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK to live with a named sponsor who can provide accommodation for a minimum of six months. Most respondents say they live with a sponsor – 59% compared with 17% who are renting from a private landlord. However, the ONS said 45% of respondents had experienced barriers to accessing private rented accommodation with “not having a guarantor or references” being the most common reason. Read the full story here: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, told a briefing that practically no thermal or hydroelectric stations had been left unscathed by the Russian attacks. Kudrytskyi said: The scale of destruction is colossal. In Ukraine there is a power generation deficit. We cannot generate as much energy as consumers can use. He said Ukrainians could face long power outages but that his company wanted to help provide the conditions for people to stay in the country through winter. Ukraine had enough fuel reserves after building them up before Russia’s invasion, he said, and was working hard to repair damaged infrastructure but was hoping to secure some spare parts abroad. He dismissed the need to evacuate civilians, after Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced on Monday the evacuation of residents from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. People from the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Asked about the proposals to evacuate some cities worst hit by energy shortages, Kudrytskyi said such calls were “inappropriate”. Ukraine will summon the ambassador of Hungary to demand an apology after its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, appeared in public wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the foreign ministry said. Orbán was pictured attending a football match wearing a scarf which the newspaper, Ukrainska Pravda, said showed a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. In a statement on Facebook, ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said: The promotion of revisionism ideas in Hungary does not contribute to the development of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations and does not comply with the principles of European policy. He added that Ukraine wanted an apology and a rebuttal of any Hungarian claims on Ukrainian territory. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, according to the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen. Here are some images we have received from Kyiv, where authorities have warned that millions could face power cuts at least until the end of March amid relentless Russian strikes. The Kremlin on Monday said it was not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. When asked by a reporter if one of the goals of a “special military operation” was regime change in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov replied: No [it is not], the president has already spoken about this. The Kremlin has shifted its stated goals in Ukraine throughout the conflict. When Putin announced his “special military operation”, he said in a speech that his country’s aim was to “demilitarise and denazify Ukraine,” indicating his maximalist goals in this war: toppling the government of Ukraine’s elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. However, as Russia’s invasion faltered, Putin dramatically scaled back his ambitions, declaring his goal in Ukraine to be the “liberation of Donbas”. Over the past few weeks, the Kremlin has repeatedly said that its goals in Ukraine could also be achieved through negotiations. Other senior Russian officials, however, have continued to push for regime change in Ukraine. Earlier this month, former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow should “completely dismantle” Ukraine’s political regime. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s main stories so far: Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, the SBU said. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex that was raided is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said on Monday, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions.

The Ukrainian government has been offering people in the recently liberated city of Kherson, which remains mostly without electricity and running water, free evacuations to regions with better infrastructure, as well as free accommodation. “Given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country,” the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia has reiterated that it is not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said his country “does not intend the ‘special operation’ to change the government in Ukraine”, Sky News reports. The Kremlin said that no substantive progress had been made towards creating a security zone around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will in coming days meet the mothers of soldiers amid fierce fighting in Ukraine, the Vedomosti newspaper reported, citing three unidentified sources in the presidential administration. Russia celebrates Mother’s Day on 27 November. The Kremlin has not officially announced any Putin meetings with soldiers’ mothers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will soon be able to add New Zealand to the list of parliaments he has addressed, after Wellington agreed to a request to do so. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the government had agreed to the request from the Canberra-based Ukrainian embassy, which serves both countries.

Russia and Ukraine accused each other of firing the shells that fell near reactors and damaged a radioactive waste storage building at the plant, Reuters reported. “Russian terrorists are shelling humanitarian delivery points, continuing nuclear blackmail – a pitiful tactic of military losers,” Andriy Yermak, chief of the presidential staff, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Well, for every such action there is a Ukrainian counteraction,” he added. An image shows the destruction of Kherson International airport in Chornobaivka, located in Kherson oblast, Ukraine. Russia has reiterated that it is not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said his country “does not intend the ‘special operation’ to change the government in Ukraine”, Sky News reports. A reporter asked Peskov if one of the goals of the “special military operation” was regime change in Ukraine. “No [it is not], the president has already spoken about this,” Peskov replied. This is in contrast to the beginning of the invasion in February, when Moscow had appeared to be aiming to overthrow the Ukrainian government and install a Russia-friendly regime. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, the SBU said. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex that was raided is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. “These measures are being taken … as part of the systemic work of the SBU to counter the destructive activities of Russian special services in Ukraine,” the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement. It said the search was aimed at preventing the use of the cave monastery as “the centre of the Russian world” and carried out to look into suspicions “about the use of the premises … for sheltering sabotage and reconnaissance groups, foreign citizens, weapons storage”. The SBU did not say what the result of the raid was. The Moscow Patriarchate did not immediately comment. In May, the Ukrainian Orthodox church of the Moscow Patriarchate ended its ties with the Russian church over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and condemned the support of Patriarch Kirill, the head of Russia’s church, for what Moscow calls its “special military operation”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will in coming days meet the mothers of soldiers amid fierce fighting in Ukraine, the Vedomosti newspaper reported, citing three unidentified sources in the presidential administration. Russia celebrates Mother’s Day on 27 November. The Kremlin has not officially announced any Putin meeting with soldiers’ mothers. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to deny or confirm the meeting, Vedomosti said. The UK Ministry of Defence’s update for today reports that Russian and Ukrainian media reported an attack at an oil terminal in Novorssiysk port on Russia’s Black Sea coast on 18 November. More on the winter energy crisis in Ukraine: the Ukrainian government has been offering people in the recently liberated city of Kherson, which remains mostly without electricity and running water, free evacuations to regions with better infrastructure, as well as free accommodation. “Given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country,” the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on the Telegram messaging app. Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians on Monday to conserve energy, saying they “should be mindful and redistribute their consumption throughout the day”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the blackouts and Russia’s strikes on energy infrastructure are the consequences of Kyiv not willing to negotiate, the state Tass news agency reported late last week. Temperatures in some of Ukraine’s regions have already dropped below freezing, including in the capital of Kyiv. Kovalenko said the country should be prepared for all options, including lengthy power outages. “Stock up on warm clothes, blankets, think about options that will help you wait a long outage,” Kovalenko said. “It’s better to do it now than to be miserable.” That’s it from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the news for the next while. The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will soon be able to add New Zealand to the list of parliaments he has addressed, after Wellington agreed to a request to do so. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the government had agreed to the request from the Canberra-based Ukrainian embassy which serves both countries. “The ask has been made. Happy to accommodate that,” she said, adding that it would be over to a parliamentary committee to find the time. The address is likely to be in the final week of the sitting year, which begins on 13 December. Zelenskiy has given Ardern an invitation to visit Kyiv, which she is yet to take-up. But the defence minister, Peeni Henare, made a 10-hour trip to the Ukrainian capital last weekend. New Zealand has given tens of millions of dollars of aid in support of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invasion, as well as donating military equipment and levying sanctions targeting Russian elites and trade. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said ambassador at large Beth Van Schaack. Evidence from liberated areas indicates “deliberate, indiscriminate and disproportionate” attacks against civilian populations, custodial abuses of civilians and POWs, forceful removal, or filtration, of Ukrainian citizens – including children – to Russia, and execution-like murders and sexual violence, she told reporters. “When we’re seeing such systemic acts, including the creation of a vast filtration network, it’s very hard to imagine how these crimes could be committed without responsibility going all the way up the chain of command,” she said. Van Schaack represents the US to global bodies investigating war crimes and other atrocities, and called the current situation a “new Nuremberg moment”, a reference to the war crimes trials held in the German city at the end of the second world war. She said in a briefing for reporters that Russia’s nine-month-old assault on Ukraine has sparked an “unprecedented array of accountability initiatives”, involving numerous bodies, along with the international criminal court in The Hague. The bodies are coordinating to develop priorities and approaches “under all available jurisdictional bases”, she said. Van Schaack declined to say specifically if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, could be prosecuted for war crimes in Ukraine. But she said prosecutors will “follow the evidence where it leads”. Under international law, the doctrine of superior responsibility allows for prosecutions “to go all the way up the chain of command”, she said. She also said that rights officials are looking closely at a video that emerged over the weekend that suggests Ukrainian troops may have killed Russian prisoners of war. Ukrainians are most likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said on Monday, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been damaged by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Sergey Kovalenko, head of the YASNO major private energy provider for Kyiv, said that workers are rushing to complete repairs before the winter cold arrives. “I would like everyone to understand: Ukrainians will most likely live with blackouts until at least the end of March,” Kovalenko said in a post on his Facebook page. He added: The basic scenario is that if there are no new attacks on the power grid, then under current conditions of electricity generation, the power deficit could be evenly distributed across the country. This means the outages will be everywhere but less lasting. There are also different forecasts of the development of this situation, and they completely depend on attacks Russia.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Ukrainians are most likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said late on Monday. Sergey Kovalenko, head of the YASNO major private energy provider for Kyiv, said that workers are rushing to complete repairs before the winter cold arrives. “I would like everyone to understand: Ukrainians will most likely live with blackouts until at least the end of March,” Kovalenko said in a post on his Facebook page. More on this soon. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, countered that the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant was a Russian tactic aiming to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. The UN nuclear watchdog was to conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the forces behind its shelling were “playing with fire” and such attacks risked a major disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station before troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/19/france-to-pay-nearly-10bn-to-fully-nationalise-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-19T09:42:33Z","webTitle":"France to pay nearly €10bn to fully nationalise EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/19/france-to-pay-nearly-10bn-to-fully-nationalise-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/19/france-to-pay-nearly-10bn-to-fully-nationalise-edf","fields":{"headline":"France to pay nearly €10bn to fully nationalise EDF","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The French government is poised to pay nearly €10bn (£8.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF as ministers attempt to tackle the European energy crisis. The French finance ministry said on Tuesday it had offered €9.7bn or €12 a share to buy the 16% of debt-laden EDF it does not already own. The government of the French prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, government is trying to shore up domestic energy supplies amid concerns over the finances of the energy company, which is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. Ministers want to take action to keep energy bills from soaring even higher amid a gas supply crunch in Europe, caused largely by soured relations with big supplier Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The €12-a-share offer is a premium of 53% to the closing value of €7.84 for EDF shares on 5 July, the day before Borne announced the nationalisation. It is also more than the €8bn price tag that emerged last week. Shares in EDF, which had been suspended since 13 July while investors awaited the details of the government plan, jumped 15% to €11.80, valuing the whole company at €45.4bn. “The price is on the high range level taking into account peers and market conditions,” said Gregory Lafitte, an analyst at Tradition. Lafitte added that most estimates for the offer price had ranged from €10.50 to €12.50. The near-€10bn investment represents a sizeable chunk of French government spending. The country’s state budget last year surpassed €400bn, including €60bn on defence spending and €61bn on state pensions. Holders of the company’s convertible debt will be offered €15.64 for each bond, and the final offer for EDF stock will be submitted to Autorité des Marchés Financiers by early September. The nationalisation offers some certainty over EDF’s finances at a crucial juncture for the company. The longstanding chairman and chief executive officer, Jean-Bernard Lévy, 67, is expected to step down as soon as September. EDF’s nuclear production accounted for 69% of France’s electricity supplies in 2021. However, this supply level is expected to fall to the lowest level in more than three decades this year because of a combination of maintenance, refuelling and repairs at 12 reactors. Separately, France agreed a long-term energy deal with the United Arab Emirates on Monday for fuel and gas supplies as it moves to reduce its dependency on Russian gas, which accounted for about 17% of its gas supplies before the war. In the UK, a delayed planning decision on the future of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant, backed by EDF, is due to be announced by the government on Wednesday. Hinkley Point C is not expected to be in operation until 2027 because of construction delays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T18:30:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 176 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 176 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN met to review the grain export deal in Lviv, as well as to discuss the rising tensions at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed upon the parameters of a possible mission led by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the power plant, with Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, warning of the dangers of “another Chornobyl”. In the meeting, Guterres told Zelenskiy of a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka in Donetsk to investigate allegations of Russian mistreatment against Ukrainian prisoners of war. Zelenskiy asked Guterres also to investigate “the issue of compliance by the Russian side with the agreements reached in the context of the withdrawal of Ukrainian defenders from Azovstal”. Erdoğan signed a memorandum with Ukraine to help reconstruct infrastructure destroyed by the war. “While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” he said. At least 15 people were killed in a series of Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv that took place late Wednesday and early Thursday morning, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Zelenskiy called the attack a “devious and cynical strike on civilians with no justification”. He said: “We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military intelligence believes Russia is planning a “provocation” at the nuclear power plant on Friday, by announcing an unexpected “day off” and closing entry to all other employees. Scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster and found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants could enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. Russian hacker group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said blocked access to more than 200 state and private Estonian institutions, but the Estonian government said the impact of the attack was limited and went “largely unnoticed”. The Russian military announced it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. The Kinzhal hypersonic missiles have a range of up to 2,000km (1,2oo miles) and fly at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept, the Russian military said. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region that Russia has sought to blame on sabotage. At least 12 Russians were reportedly killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the state border guard service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Ukraine has not lost any US-supplied Himars rocket launchers, the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in contradiction to Russian claims. Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at about 11am on Tuesday. The first wartime shipment of UN food aid for Africa reached the Bosphorus Strait on Wednesday under a UN-backed deal to restore Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea. Marine traffic sites showed the MV Brave Commander taking its cargo of 23,000 tonnes of wheat across the heart of Istanbul bound for its final destination in Djibouti next week. Canada has disbursed C$450m ($348m) in loans for the purchase of heating fuel before winter for Ukraine, the finance minister in Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland, has announced. Russia foresees a 38% rise in energy export earnings this year due to higher oil export volumes, coupled with rising gas prices, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters. Russia’s earnings from energy exports are forecast to reach $337.5bn this year, a 38% rise on 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T17:56:20Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukrainian fighter pilots learning to fly F-16 jets as Kyiv claims progress in counteroffensive – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukrainian fighter pilots learning to fly F-16 jets as Kyiv claims progress in counteroffensive – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good evening. It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of today’s main news stories. Kyiv reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing “There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front].” Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles) of territory in its counteroffensive, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: “We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands.” Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general revealed. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. A group of UN experts said they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the “verge of being severed”. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries’ “strategic partnership” during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot towards Asia and Africa. A Russian anti-war activist died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow’s war in Ukraine. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group remained “laser-focused” on meeting Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence system needs. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said a number of measures had been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe’s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia, but that signing a document on security on the site was “unrealistic” while the two sides were still fighting. The US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark announced they will partner to send defence equipment – including hundreds of missiles – to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed “within several weeks”. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. MEPs called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combating the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: “I know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital. We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine.” Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. The Kryvyi Rih mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, reported no deaths in the latest attack on Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town, but said a 38-year-old man was reportedly wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. Russian forces claimed they successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons. The head of Russia’s electoral commission said the defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections on 10 September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, the state news agency Tass reported. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. Follow our live coverage again tomorrow for the latest in Ukraine. Thank you for reading. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Thursday that he hoped for a positive outcome from Vladimir Putin’s planned talks with African leaders on the future of a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine. Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. As he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels, the former prime minister of Norway said: The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them. As recently as February, Joe Biden declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine’s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s, should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark are sending “high-priority” air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery will be completed within weeks. A group of UN experts said on Thursday they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. The UN experts said the torture included electric shocks, hoodings and mock executions and had been carried out to extract intelligence, force confessions or in response to alleged support for Ukraine’s forces, Reuters reports. The UN special rapporteur on torture, Alice Jill Edwards, said the alleged victims included civilians and prisoners of war. She said she had written to Moscow about this. A spokesperson for Russia’s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has previously denied torturing or mistreating prisoners of war and says it does not deliberately target civilians in Ukraine. While torture allegations have previously been levelled against both sides in the 15-month conflict, the team of UN independent experts said Russian forces’ methods may be “state-endorsed”. The consistency and methods of alleged torture suggested “a level of coordination, planning and organisation, as well as the direct authorisation, deliberate policy or official tolerance from superior authorities,” according to Edwards. She said: Obeying a superior order or policy direction cannot be invoked as justification for torture, and any individual involved should be promptly investigated and prosecuted by independent authorities. Russia’s economy shrank by a revised 1.8% year on year in the first quarter of 2023, data from the Rosstat federal statistics service showed on Thursday, after growth of 3% in the same period of last year. Russia’s economy defied early expectations of a double-digit collapse in 2022 but still contracted 2.1% after the west imposed sanctions in response to Moscow dispatching troops to Ukraine in February. Rosstat had previously forecast a 1.9% decline in the first quarter, Reuters reports. African leaders could propose a series of “confidence-building measures” during their initial efforts to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to a draft framework document seen by Reuters on Thursday. Those measures could include a Russian troop pullback, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, suspension of an international criminal court arrest warrant targeting Vladimir Putin, and sanctions relief. A cessation of hostilities agreement could follow and would need to be accompanied by negotiations between Russia and the west, the document states. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. The US Congress has approved more than $100bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid for Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. While leaders of both parties insist US support for the Kyiv government remains strong, some members of Congress have questioned how long that level of aid can continue amid calls to clamp down on government spending. The bill’s sponsors said their intention was to ensure Moscow pays for damage caused by the invasion, not US taxpayers. Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee and a sponsor of the bill, said: Over a year into Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, more than $300bn in Russian sovereign assets remain frozen globally. Given Russia’s brutality and continued war crimes against the Ukrainian people, it is only right that Russian government funds in the United States be seized and repurposed to help Ukraine rebuild its country. Among other things, the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (Repo) for Ukrainians Act introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives would give the US president the authority to confiscate Russian assets frozen in the US and transfer them to help Ukraine. It also would bar the release of funds to sanctioned Russian entities until Russia withdraws from Ukraine and agrees to provide compensation for harm caused by the war. The bill’s other Republican sponsors include representatives Michael McCaul, chair of the House foreign affairs committee, and Joe Wilson, Thomas Kean and Brian Fitzpatrick. Democratic sponsors include Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and representative Marcy Kaptur, a co-chair of the congressional Ukraine caucus, as well as representatives Steve Cohen and Mike Quigley. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries’ “strategic partnership” during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot Russia towards Asia and Africa. The two leaders signed a declaration on “deep strategic partnership”, among other agreements. Putin said: We are really happy to receive our friend, the president of Algeria, Mr Tebboune, in the Kremlin. Algeria is a key partner for us in the Arab world and in Africa. We will be glad to see you in St Petersburg. Relations with Algeria are of particular importance for our country. Tebboune said western pressure on Algeria would not have any impact, and both men stressed the Soviet Union’s robust support for Algeria during and after its fight for independence from France. Tebboune said: Foreign countries may put pressure on us today but this will never affect our ties. Our ties never changed. Algeria has always supported Russia. Tebboune saidRussia had been providing his country with weapons to help it “maintain our independence in these difficult circumstances”. The Russian foreign ministry tweeted that Vladimir Putin held talks with the president of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, during a state visit to Russia. Putin reportedly said there was “tangible potential for further development” between the two nations. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the “verge of being severed”. Canada on Saturday ordered the seizure of a Russian-registered Antonov-124 cargo plane at Toronto’s airport, its first such asset seizure aimed at putting pressure on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion, Reuters reports. Russia told Brian Ebel, the deputy head of Canada’s embassy in Moscow, that it viewed the plane seizure as “cynical theft”, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. In a statement, the Russian ministry said: [Canada’s’] Russophobic policy will entail the most serious repercussions for Russian-Canadian relations, which are on the verge of being severed through the fault of the Trudeau administration. The Canadian foreign ministry did not have an immediate comment. Canada announced the aircraft seizure while the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was in Kyiv on Saturday, where he announced $500m (£392m) in military aid for Ukraine. A Russian anti-war activist has died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said today. Anatoly Berezikov’s lawyer Irina Gak said in a video posted on Facebook that the body of her client, who had been due to be released on Thursday, had been taken to a morgue on Wednesday. A video filmed on Wednesday showed Gak standing outside the detention centre where 40-year-old Berezikov had been held as an ambulance that she said was there to collect his body drove in, Reuters reports. These claims have not been independently verified. In the video, Gak said Berezikov had complained of beatings and of being given electric shocks and had told her he feared for his life. According to Gak, Berezikov was arrested after he posted leaflets around the city advertising a Ukrainian government project called I Want to Live, which helps Russian soldiers voluntarily surrender. Rostov-on-Don is the capital of a region adjoining Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine. According to OVD-Info, a human rights monitoring group, nearly 20,000 people have been detained for protesting against Russia’s war in Ukraine since the start of the invasion. They claim criminal cases have been launched against more than 580 people. The Polish deputy prime minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, saying he had “no doubts” that Vladimir Putin’s true intentions were to “go further” after conquering Ukraine. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said on Thursday that Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow’s “aggressive war” in Ukraine. The Czech leader and former chair of the Nato military committee said he was sympathetic to Russians outside the country finding it hard to cope with the invasion but in the context of a war, security measures should be more stringent. He told the Prague-based, US-financed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: When there is an ongoing war, the security measures related to Russian nationals should be stricter than in normal times. All Russians living in western countries should be monitored much more than in the past because they are citizens of a nation that leads an aggressive war,” Pavel said. That’s simply the cost of war. He said the situation was similar to the second world war when more than 100,000 Japanese descendants based in the US were under “a strict monitoring regime as well” as they were placed in local internment camps. Pavel also said he expected the July Nato summit in Vilnius to voice clear support for Kyiv’s membership of the alliance. He said: I strongly believe that all the leaders will understand that having Ukraine onboard – both in Nato and EU – is probably the only guarantee [of] how to ensure stability in this region, how to make both Nato and EU stronger, and how to keep Russia and its aggressive policies at bay. I see a number of countries agreeing on a long-term plan of support to Ukraine that will not be based on one-off contributions but on a carefully planned long-term procedure. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting has concluded and it remains “laser-focused” on meeting Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence system needs. He added: That’s especially important since Russia has ruthlessly ramped up its missile and drone attacks over the past month against Ukraine’s cities. Zelenskiy’s former spokesperson has shared this video of Kyiv graduates waltzing in the subway during an air raid alert: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said a “number of measures” have been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe’s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia (see also this earlier post), but that signing a document on security on the site was “unrealistic” while the two sides were still fighting. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief visited the plant, in southern Ukraine, today after meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss concerns about the site. Russia’s deputy finance minister, Alexei Sazanov, has said the country is approaching the tax ceiling for commodity industries. He cited what he called weak global demand for its products, reports Interfax news agency. The US, UK, Netherlands and Denmark have announced they will partner to send defence equipment – including hundreds of missiles – to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed “within several weeks”. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. While the details remain unclear and unconfirmed, a number of Russian Telegram channels have been discussing the attack, which they say took place near Kreminna, an eastern town in the Luhansk region where there has been heavy fighting. The alleged incident took place as soldiers were gathered and made to wait for two hours for a speech from a divisional commander, identified by some as Sukhrab Akhmedov, of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army, an already controversial figure who had been blamed for the deaths of large numbers of his troops in a botched offensive last year. According to the Russian military blogger Rybar, the soldiers who were due to be deployed on an offensive had been told to muster for a speech. The tragic incident occurred near Kreminna, in one of the divisions that was about to go on the offensive. For two hours, people stood in a crowd in one place and waited for the division commander to deliver a motivational speech. But instead, Himars and enemy artillery spoke. Rybar added there “were fewer casualties in several days of fighting in the south Donetsk direction than from the criminal stupidity of the division commander”. Other military bloggers quickly weighed in. “If by the middle of the second year of the war there are commanders who take the columns to the front, make the personnel form a big heap and then wait for the enemy’s artillery to hit them, then such commanders should be shot in front of the columns, even if they are colonels or generals,” said one. “We are at war with our own stupidity and negligence,” said another. The strike was given additional credence by the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, which included it in its daily updated on the conflict: ISW has observed both of the 20th CAA’s divisions, the 144th and 3rd Motorized Rifle Ddivisions, operating in the Kreminna area for the past several months and could not confirm which division was struck by the Ukrainian forces. One milblogger[military blogger] suggested that the reported Ukrainian HIMARSimars strike killed around 100 Russian personnel and wounded another 100, although ISW has not observed any visual confirmation of the strike or its aftermath.[9] The outrage is reminiscent of previous instances of notable irresponsible Russian military actions resulting in dramatic losses, particularly the 31 December 2022, Ukrainian strike on a large Russian force concentration in Makiivka, Donetsk oblast. MEPs have called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year, a press release from the European parliament says. There were 425 votes in favour of the resolution and 38 against, with 42 abstentions. The release says: MEPs stress that they expect that the “accession process will start after the war is over and be finalised as soon as possible”. Until full membership is achieved, the EU and its member states, together with Nato allies and like-minded partners, must work closely with Ukraine to develop a temporary framework for security guarantees, MEPs say, which is to be implemented immediately after the war. Parliament emphasises that Ukraine’s integration in both Nato and the EU would enhance regional and global security and strengthen the bonds between Ukraine and the Euro-Atlantic community. MEPs condemned “in the strongest possible terms Russia’s destruction of the Kakhovka dam” on 6 June, which they said had caused extensive flooding and created an environmental disaster as well as ecocide in Ukraine. All those responsible for war crimes, including the destruction of the dam, would be held accountable in line with international law, they added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combatting the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: I know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine. Switzerland has a longstanding policy of barring any country that buys Swiss arms from re-exporting them to the parties in a conflict. The country also imposed a specific Swiss embargo on munitions going to either Russia or Ukraine in November last year, Reuters reports. Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the Swiss parliament via video message, where he asked Switzerland to take a leading role in the global peace summit on Ukraine, Reuters reports. Here are some images from the wires. More information to come … Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul reported no deaths in the latest attack on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town, but said a 38-year-old man had been wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. On Telegram, Vilkul wrote: The destruction is significant. The attack on Kryvyi Rih followed missile strikes that killed at least 12 people in the city on Tuesday. Russia denies targeting civilians, but Ukrainian officials said none of the buildings hit had any links to the armed forces, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s military also reported a new Russian attack on the southern port city of Odesa overnight but said all 18 drones launched by Russia had been shot down. An 80-year-old woman was killed and another person wounded in an attack on the Zelenivka settlement in Kherson in southern Ukraine, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russia’s Tass news agency quoted Moscow-installed officials in Russian-occupied territory in the Kherson region, which was hit by flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, as saying a child had been killed by Ukrainian shelling. Both sides have reported heavy fighting in the early stages of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km, or 38 sq miles, of territory in its counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands. He confirmed that in the early stages of the offensive, which Ukraine said had begun last week, seven settlements had been liberated in the eastern region of Donetsk and in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports. The army has advanced by to 3km (1.8 miles) near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia sector and by up to 7km near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in the Donetsk sector, military officials said. Russia has not officially acknowledged the Ukrainian advances. These claims have not been independently verified. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog visited Europe’s largest atomic power plant on Thursday in southern Ukraine, where the Kakhovka dam burst earlier this month. The visit was announced by Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, in a Telegram post. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)chief, met Tuesday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss concerns about the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm over the facility, which has repeatedly been caught in the crossfire since Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. Last week, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine’s partially Russian-occupied Kherson region added a new concern. The dam, further down the Dnipro River, helped keep water in a reservoir that cools the plant’s reactors. The plant’s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Russia’s central election commission on Thursday set the date for regional elections in four Ukrainian provinces that Moscow claims to have annexed for 10 September coinciding with votes in other Russian regions, state news agency RIA reported. Tass, another state news agency, cited election chief Ella Pamfilova as saying that Russia’s Defence Ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) considered it possible to hold the votes in September. Ruslan Stefanchuk, chair of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, has said the European parliament expects that the summits in Vilnius and Washington in the coming months will mark the start of Ukraine’s accession to Nato after strong support for the country’s integration into the Euro-Atlantic community. Nato sees no sign that Russia has changed its nuclear stance, the head of the military alliance said Thursday, after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed that Belarus had already received some tactical nuclear weapons from Moscow. In an interview on state television on Tuesday, Lukashenko brashly warned that he would not hesitate to order their use if Belarus faced an act of aggression. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has said the weapons will be deployed to Belarus next month and will remain under Moscow’s exclusive control. At the Nato headquarters in Brussels, Belgium the secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters: We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing. So far, we haven’t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Russia has invested heavily in new modern nuclear capabilities and also deployed more nuclear capabilities, including close to Nato borders, for instance, in the high north.” Nato’s secretive nuclear defence planning group is due to meet on Friday. Russian forces successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons, Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday, according to the state-run RIA news agency. The ministry also said Russian air defences had intercepted five US-built Himars-launched missiles and shot down 25 drones, the Tass news agency also reported. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come … Kyiv on Thursday reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing: There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. Around the frontline hotspot of Bakhmut, “the enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces”, according to AFP Still, Maliar reported an advance of more than 3km (1.8 miles) in the area of Bakhmut. Oleksiy Gromov of the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said Ukrainian forces have recaptured seven settlements and more than 100 sq km of territory. Russia claims to have repelled all Ukrainian assaults. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the soldiers who have lost their lives have not died in vain because Ukraine will defeat Russia. He said Ukrainians would honour their memory by winning and “living in freedom”. The head of Russia’s electoral commission has said that the country’s defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections in September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, state news agency Tass reported on Thursday. Russia does not fully control the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fighting is ongoing in all four regions. The regions are scheduled to elect local governors in September, Reuters reports. Russia declared the regions part of its own territory after hastily conducting what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine last September that Kyiv and the west denounced as illegal and coercive. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a “marathon, not a sprint” and that America will “stand with Ukraine for the long haul”. He made the comments at a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. Also speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said defence ministers meet today at a “critical time” for the war in Ukraine in a “more dangerous world”. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused “significant” damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” Handing over to Mabel Banfield-Nwachi now. Thanks for reading. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has arrived at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Grossi is expected to inspect the plant after last week’s breach of the Kakhovka dam. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that Russia intends to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions. Meanwhile, the Kremlin accused Australia of being “hostile” and of “Russophobic hysteria” after it refused to grant approval for its plans to build a new embassy in Canberra, reports Reuters. It also said it saw no positive prospects of renewing the Black Sea grain deal, claiming that parts of the accord affecting Russia remained unfulfilled. A Kremlin spokesperson said: Work is ongoing, but to be honest we don’t see any particularly positive prospects. Everything that was agreed on regarding us has not been fulfilled. The current situation, he said, could not go on indefinitely. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a resident of the southern Bryansk region who it said had been gathering data on security forces in areas bordering Ukraine, Russian state news agency Tass reports. Separately, it said, the FSB had detained two men in the southern Stavropol region on suspicion of planning to blow up the interior ministry headquarters in the city of Pyatigorsk. The RIA news agency said the two men were believed to be supporters of the Islamic State group, reports Reuters. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has reportedly been pictured on a visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukrainian pilots have started training to fly F-16 fighters, the Nato secretary general has said. Jens Stoltenberg was speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Norway and Denmark for their new joint defence package announced earlier (see also this post). He tweeted: A child was killed by Ukrainian shelling in the partly Russian-held southern Kherson region, Reuters reports, citing the Tass news agency. Kherson is one of four regions Russia claims to have annexed from Ukraine last year, though its forces do not fully control the territory. Vladimir Putin has praised his “dear friend” Xi Jinping on the Chinese leader’s 70th birthday. The Russian president told Xi “it is difficult to overestimate the efforts you have been making to foster the comprehensive partnership” between his country and China, which have ramped up cooperation in recent years, reports AFP. He expects “constructive dialogue ... to continue for the sake of the Russian and Chinese people”, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a “marathon, not a sprint” and that America will “stand with Ukraine for the long haul”. In public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels he paid tribute to the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, who he was earlier pictured embracing, and said Ukraine “stands well positioned for the challenges ahead.” “Make no mistake, we will stand with Ukraine for the long haul,” he said, adding that US commitment is reflected in its security and defence support. The contact group, he said, has been focused on protecting Ukrainian infrastructure with air defence assets and will continue to adapt systems to meet changing needs on the ground. In today’s meeting they will talk about future training plans, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said the attack on Kryvyi Rih is “one more reminder of the war’s devastating consequences to civilians”. The Russian missile attack “killed nearly a dozen people and injured many more”, he said, adding that recently people have had to ration water due to the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in Kherson. The war was at a “critical and historic moment”, he told the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is about to make his opening remarks in Brussels. Ukraine said it intercepted one cruise missile and 20 drones overnight. But it said three other missiles struck “industrial installations” in the Dnipropetrovsk region in Ukraine’s centre-east, reports AFP. Meanwhile, the Moscow-installed governor of Crimea said Russian forces had downed nine drones over its territory, without causing any casualties. It comes after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed on Tuesday that his forces were inflicting “catastrophic” losses on Ukrainian troops. Nato members are racing to complete a plan to provide long-term support to Ukraine, but are wrestling with now best to assure its security until it can join the military alliance, reports Reuters citing US and European officials. The plan is expected to be approved next month at the Nato summit in Vilnius. Tweeting from Nato HQ in Brussels, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, pledges continued support to Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. He is due to deliver public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group later this morning. Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties, has shared a picture of a “cabinet with children’s books” from flooded Kherson, which she said had floated to the Odesa shore: Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is “reckless and dangerous”, the Nato secretary general has said. Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s behaviour is “part of a pattern” which Nato has responded to. “If we want a just and enduring peace” then Nato has to continue with its military support for Ukraine, he added. He said he expects Nato leaders to extend their defence spending pledges, but that he doesn’t expect it to be agreed until the Nato summit in Vilnius next month. Speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said defence ministers meet today at a “critical time” in a “more dangerous world”. He said: Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive, what we see is fierce fighting. It’s still early days but we also see that Ukrainians are making gains and that Ukraine is able to liberate occupied land. He highlights support Nato allies have been giving to Ukraine “for many many months actually makes a difference on the battlefield”. They will be looking at how to sustain support in meeting today. “The war in Ukraine just demonstrates the need to stand with Ukraine” and for continued support, he said. They also plan to strengthen defence spending. Today they will meet defence industry members and agree at the meeting “new capability targets” to ensure sufficient ammunition which he said will be “significantly higher” than previously. “Ukraine needs many different types of support” but focus will be on sustainment, he said during questions. Nato defence ministers are meeting in Brussels today. A doorstep statement by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is due to come shortly. Norway and Denmark have agreed to donate an additional 9,000 rounds of artillery to Ukraine. Norway will send shells and Denmark fuses and propellant charges, the Norwegian government announced. The Norwegian defence minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, said: Ukraine has an urgent need for artillery ammunition. We have therefore decided to join forces with Denmark for a new donation, so that Ukraine receives the ammunition as quickly as possible. It is important that we continue to stand together in demonstrating our support of Ukraine. Norway will continue to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion forces as long as it is needed. The acting Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said Denmark would additionally donate 1,500 complete artillery rounds and 500 shells. The breach of the Kakhovka dam will not affect Russia’s crop forecasts, the Russian deputy prime minister, Viktoria Abramchenko, has said, according to the state-owned news agency Tass. Hi, I’ll be looking after the blog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@theguardian.com The Australian government has rushed through special legislation allowing it to cancel Russia’s lease on a site for a new embassy near the country’s parliament, citing national security concerns. Prime minister Anthony Albanese promised to act “quickly to ensure the leased site does not become a formal diplomatic presence”. The Russian government took legal action after a decision in August to terminate its lease on a block of land in the capital, Canberra. On 31 May the Russian government won its case in Australia’s federal court, which found the termination was “invalid and of no effect”. Albanese told reporters in Canberra the government had “received very clear security advice as to the risk presented by a new Russian presence so close to parliament House”. Australia’s home affairs minister said “the principal problem with the proposed second Russian embassy in Canberra is its location. This location sits directly adjacent to Parliament House.” The governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region has shared images that are reportedly from the site of the strikes on Kryvyi Rih. Serhiy Lysak said that two industrial complexes were hit in overnight strikes on the city, injuring one person. While the damage was reported to be ‘“significant”, the city’s mayor said the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Japan is in talks to provide artillery shells to the US to bolster stocks for Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia. To date, Japan has only provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine. The report claims that Tokyo is considering supplying 155mm artillery shells “under a 2016 agreement that allows the Japan and the US to share ammunition as part of their longstanding security alliance.” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held talks earlier this month in Tokyo with Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada. After the meeting, Austin praised Japan for the nonlethal military support it has given Ukraine and said additional assistance would be welcome. In March, the EU’s most senior diplomat warned that there would be “difficulties” if western countries failed to reach a deal to replenish Ukraine’s dwindling stocks of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. The commander, Adam Delimkhanov, heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Delimkhanov was “alive and well and not even wounded”. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian media, citing the parliamentary press service, said that Delimkhanov had been wounded in Ukraine. It followed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused “significant” damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” Three missiles hit two industrial enterprises overnight, Vilkul said, adding that a fourth was shot down by air defences. Thank you to the employees of the enterprises who, after the announcement of the air raid alert, went to the shelter, because of which they remained unharmed … All important infrastructure, public transport, social and medical institutions [in] the city work stably.” Vilkul said that at noon local time, a planned explosion would be carried out for “production purposes”. Odesa was reportedly targeted by Russian strikes overnight, after already enduring a deadly wave in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s southern military command released a statement in the early hours of Thursday morning, saying Russia was attacking “with unmanned aerial vehicles” – meaning drones – and there was “also a threat of a missile attack”, while advising residents to go to shelters. Officials later said that all 20 drones that attacked in the south were destroyed by air defence forces. On Wednesday, three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Authorities said that air defences downed two of the Russian Kalibr cruise missiles launched on Wednesday morning, but the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. Ukrainian military officials said that Wednesday’s attack on Odesa was “apparently aimed at the objects sought by the enemy in the area of logistics support for the defence forces.” Russian cruise missiles hit two industrial complexes in the central city of Kryvyi Rih overnight, according to Serhiy Lysak, the region’s governor. Lysak said the strikes caused significant damage, including broken gas pipelines. Fires broke out at enterprises, which rescuers have already put out.” A 38-year-old man was injured in the attack and has been hospitalised. Military officials said that four cruise missiles were launched by Russia overnight. One of the missiles was destroyed by air defences, the rest hit industrial facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Kryvyi Rih is located. It’s the second time that Kryvyi Rih – Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home city – has been targeted by Russian airstrikes this week. On Tuesday morning, at least 12 people were killed and many more were wounded after a missile struck an apartment block and a food warehouse in the city. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, my name is Jonathan Yerushalmy. The central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been hit by Russian airstrikes for the second time this week. Cruise missiles struck two industrial enterprises, the region’s governor said. A 38-year-old man was injured in the attacks. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s port city of Odesa was targeted by Russian airstrikes for the second day in a row. Users on Ukrainian social media reported hearing explosions and Ukraine’s southern military command said that Russia was attacking “with unmanned aerial vehicles” and there was also “a threat of a missile attack.” More on that shortly, first here’s are the other key developments from the last 24 hours: Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. “This is incredibly difficult,” the official said. “They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.” Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. “It is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,” he said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia’s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world’s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-462-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T17:45:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 462 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-462-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-462-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 462 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"French president Emmanuel Macron has said that Vladimir Putin may not face war crime charges if the war in Ukraine ends in a negotiation. In a speech in Bratislava, he said: “If in a few months to come we have a window for negotiations, the question will be arbitrage between a trial and a negotiation, and you have to negotiate with the leaders you have de facto, and I think negotiations will be a priority … You can put yourself in a position where you say: ‘I want you to go jail but you are the only one I can negotiate with’.” Macron also said that Ukraine needed security assurances. Leaders will meet in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, in July to discuss Ukraine’s Nato membership. Russia does not plan to declare martial law after Tuesday’s large-scale drone strike on Moscow, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said. Figures from Russia, including the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov, said Putin should declare martial law nationwide to “sweep away that terrorist gang”. Only 500 people are left in Bakhmut, the city in the east of Ukraine which has been subject to heavy fighting in the last year, according to the city’s mayor. The figure from Oleksii Reva, reported by the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN, is a tiny fraction of its prewar population of 70,000. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, has said he has asked prosecutors to investigate “crimes” committed by senior Russian defence officials before and during the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has claimed it destroyed the last major warship of the Ukrainian naval forces, the Yuri Olefirenko, which it said was stationed in the southern port of Odesa. The Russian air force said it attacked the ship on 29 May. Ukraine has not commented. Russia has said it will evacuate children from villages near its border with Ukraine, after the Belgorod region has been shelled for several days. “The situation in (the border village of) Shebekino is worsening,” the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram. Analysis from the Kyiv Post has claimed that about 90% of the 500 missiles and drones launched by Russia in May in attacks on Ukraine failed, to the cost of $1.7bn. It said that 533 of them were destroyed by the Ukrainian air force. It includes 401 Shahed-136 drones, which cost about $20,000 each. The Russian security council deputy chair, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Wednesday Britain was Moscow’s “eternal enemy” and that any British officials who facilitated the war in Ukraine could be considered legitimate military targets. Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, was responding to British foreign secretary James Cleverly’s remark that Ukraine had a right to project force beyond its own borders, said Britain’s “goofy officials” should remember that Britain could be “qualified as being at war”. A 60-year-old man has been killed in the shelling of Vovchansk in Kharkiv. Germany’s government spokesperson has said Ukraine has the right to attack Russian territory as it qualifies as self-defence. In an interview with German newspaper Deutsche Welle, Steffen Hebestreit said: “International law allows Ukraine to carry out strikes on the territory of Russia for the purpose of self-defence.” The UN has proposed that Kyiv, Moscow and Ankara start preparatory work for the transit of Russian ammonia through Ukraine as it tries to salvage a deal allowing safe Black Sea grain exports, a source close to the talks has told Reuters. Drones attacked two oil refineries just 40-50 miles (65-80 km) east of Russia’s biggest oil export terminals on Wednesday, sparking a fire at one and causing no damage to the other, according to Russian officials. At around 2am BST a drone struck the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region, causing a fire which was later extinguished, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said. Another drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery, which lies around 40 miles east of Novorossiisk. Five people have been killed and 19 injured in the shelling of a village in Russian-occupied Luhansk region, according to the Telegram channel of Russian-installed officials there. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, has reported on Telegram that an eight-year-old child has been injured in the shelling of the village of Mezhyrich near Pavlohrad in his region. The governor of Belgorod, a Russian region that borders Ukraine, has claimed that four people were injured in Ukrainian shelling on a town close to the border. Two people were hospitalised as a result of the artillery strike on Shebekino, Vyacheslav Gladkov said, adding that it was the third time in a week the town had been hit. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accused Ukraine on Tuesday of seeking to “frighten” Russians after Moscow was targeted with a large-scale drone attack for the first time in the 15-month war. He said that Ukraine had chosen the path of attempting “to intimidate Russia, Russian citizens [with] attacks on residential buildings” and added that the drone attacks were “clearly a sign of terrorist activity.” Ukrainian presidential aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied Ukraine was involved. However, he did he predict “an increase in the number of attacks”. One of the drones used in Tuesday morning’s raid on Moscow appears to have been a Ukrainian manufactured UJ 22 drone produced by the Ukrjet company. Alleged footage of the drone, captured in flight during the attack, appears to match released images of the unmanned aerial vehicle which Russia has claimed has been used in other attempted attacks. The Russian defence ministry said eight drones targeted the city overnight but Russian media close to the security services wrote that the number was many times higher, with more than 30 drones participating in the attack. Restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine into the EU would need to be extended, the bloc’s agricultural minister said on Tuesday, despite opposition from Kyiv. The restrictions were implemented after complaints from eastern EU countries that a surplus of Ukrainian grain was driving down local prices and affecting local farmers. Sweden’s accession into Nato is “within reach”, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. Sweden formally applied to join Nato last year, but was blocked by Turkey over claims that Kurdish militants had settled in the country. Stoltenberg said it was “possible to reach a solution and enable the decision on full membership for Sweden by “ the Nato summit in July. Neither Russia nor Ukraine committed to respect the five principles laid out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to try to safeguard Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The principles included that there should be no attacks on, or from the plant and that no heavy weapons should be housed there. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said he was encouraged that the principles were “widely supported and there was no voice opposing them.” The Russian and Ukrainian envoys at the United Nations blamed each other’s countries for the crisis at Zaporizhzhia, but did not reject outright the principles put forward by the IAEA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T23:29:20Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy says dam attack an ‘environmental bomb of mass destruction’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy says dam attack an ‘environmental bomb of mass destruction’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Kyiv Independent reports that Ukraine will allocate US$40.6 million for the construction of new water mains: Russian forces repeatedly fired at an ammonia pipeline in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, a local governor said on Tuesday, a conduit potentially crucial for the extension of a deal allowing the safe export of grains and fertilisers from Black Sea ports. Reuters report that the ammonia pipeline, the world’s longest, stretches about 2,470 kilometres (1,534 miles) from Russia’s Togliatti on the Volga River to three Black Sea ports. It has been shut down since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There was no recorded leakage from the late Tuesday shelling that hit the pipeline near the village of Masiutivka and an overnight shelling near the village of Zapadne, said Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. “There is no threat to people’s lives and health,” Sinehubov said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted.Sunak said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. US military chief Milley said Ukraine is “well prepared” for a counteroffensive. The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he “does not understand” how there are any doubts that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. George Barros, an analyst at the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, has shared these images showing the extent of the flooding southeast of Kherson city: The Associated Press has this sketch from the evacuations: As shelling from Russia’s war on Ukraine echoed overhead, dozens of evacuees on an island in the Dnipro River scurried on to the tops of military trucks or into rafts to flee rising flood waters caused by the breach of a dam upstream. The unnerving bark of dogs left behind further soured the mood of those ferried to safety. A woman in one raft clutched the head of her despondent daughter. A stalled military truck stuck in swelling waters raised the panic level as Red Cross teams tried to manage an orderly evacuation. Nobody knew just how high the waters rushing through a gaping hole in the Kakhovka dam would rise, or whether people or pets would escape alive. The scrambled evacuation by boat and military truck from an island neighbourhood off the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson downstream on Tuesday testified to the latest human chaos caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities accused Russian forces of purposely destroying the dam. Russian authorities blamed recent Ukrainian military strikes. “The Russians have hit the dam, and didn’t think of consequences,” said Oleksandr Sokeryn, who fled his house with his family after it was completely flooded. “They should not be forgiven.” Officials on both sides said the massive dam breach had caused no civilian casualties, and the hurried escape was aimed to keep it that way. Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted. The British PM said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. Here are some recent photos of residents from the areas affected by flooding: The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam has been widely condemned as a possible war crime. John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the national security council, said the US was assessing whether it a war crime Multiple Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that if Russia had attacked the dam it would be a war crime under the terms of the Geneva conventions. The conventions mention dams, which are listed under “works containing dangerous forces”: Article 56 – Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces 1. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Hi, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our coverage of the war in Ukraine and the attack on Nova Kakhovka dam. I’ll be with you for the next while. If you see news you think we may have missed, have questions, or live near Nova Kakhovka dam get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Russia’s UN envoy was accused of floundering in a mud of lies when he claimed at an emergency session of the UN security council that Ukraine was guilty of a extremely dangerous strategy and a war crime by destroying Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukraine envoy to the UN, said it was typical of Russians to blame the victim for its own crimes, noting that Russia has controlled the dam for more than a year and it would have been physically impossible to blow it up by shelling. He said the dam was mined by the Russian occupiers who blew it up and accused Russia of floundering in a mud of lies. Kyslytsya also said the flooding caused by the explosion was going to be far worse on the Ukrainian occupied side of the Dnipro river. “By resorting to scorched earth tactics, or in this case to flooded Earth tactics, the Russian occupiers have effectively recognised that the captured territory does not belong to them, and they are not able to hold these lands,” he said. Neither French US or British representatives at the UN directly claimed there was evidence of Russian responsibility, but called for an investigation and insisted their support was unwavering to Ukraine. The United States said it was “not certain” who was to blame for a burst dam in Ukraine, but it would not make sense for Ukraine to have done this to its own people and territory, while Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the disaster. The 15-member UN security council met on Tuesday at the request of both Russia and Ukraine after a torrent of water burst through a massive dam on the Dnipro River, which separates the opposing forces in southern Ukraine. When asked if the United States knew who was responsible, deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told reporters ahead of the council meeting: “We’re not certain at all, we hope to have more information in the coming days.” “But, I mean, come on … why would Ukraine do this to its own territory and people, flood its land, force tens of thousands of people to leave their homes – it doesn’t make sense,” Wood said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said earlier on Tuesday that it did not have any independent information on how the dam burst, but described it as “another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. The head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev will hold in Minsk security talks with his Belarusian counterpart this week as well as the security heads of several other countries in the region, Russia’s news agencies reported. Patrushev is to hold talks with the head of Belarus security Alexander Wolfovich on Wednesday and the heads of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), on Thursday, TASS reported. The CSTO is an intergovernmental military alliance consisting of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Asked whether the subject would be raised with the US President Joe Biden at their meeting on Thursday, Rishi Sunak added: “Of course I’ll be discussing Ukraine with President Biden, generally, but the immediate response is humanitarian. “So we had already put resources and funding in place to support both the UN and the Red Cross to respond to situations like this. “And they are now being able to divert those resources to particularly help the humanitarian response and the evacuation in this area as a result of what’s happened. “So we were already thinking ahead about situations like this, and I’m pleased that the UK is continuing to support Ukraine in lots of different ways.” Rishi Sunak said the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine would mark a “new low” in the conflict if Russian forces were found to be responsible. The UK’s prime minister said the immediate priority was the humanitarian response to the catastrophe, which has flooded villages, endangered vital crops and threatened drinking water supplies. Sunak, speaking to reporters as he travelled to Washington for talks with US President Joe Biden, said if it was an intentional act to blow up the dam it would be “the largest attack on civilian infrastructure” since the start of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said attacks on civilian infrastructure were “appalling and wrong”. Sunak said: “Our military and intelligence agencies are currently looking at it, so it’s too soon to pre-empt that and make a definitive judgment. “But what I can say is if it is intentional, it would represent, I think, the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war, and just would demonstrate the new lows that we would have seen from Russian aggression. “Attacks on civilian infrastructure are appalling and wrong. We’ve seen previous instances of that in this conflict so far, but it’s too early to say definitively.” In his nightly address, president Zelensky also said Ukrainian prosecutors had already approached prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague “to involve international justice in the investigation of the destruction of the dam”. And for the second day running, Zelenskiy singled out military units fighting in and near the long-besieged eastern city of Bakhmut while giving no details of the clashes, Reuters reports. Here are some more images sent to us on the news wires on Tuesday afternoon showing the aftermath of the explosion and collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts, Reuters reports. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. He said that he destruction of the dam would “not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still liberate all our land. Only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from the Russian occupiers will guarantee that there will be no more such terrorist attacks.” The government of Spain has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in a statement issued Tuesday night, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent Sam Jones reports. The statement stops short of blaming Russia for the incident, but makes clear Spain believes a crime has taken place: This act, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, affects the lives and safety of thousands of people in the region and represents a huge environmental harm. Here’s our sketch from the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh in Kherson, following the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam: On what should have been a Kherson street corner, Larysa Musian, a hydrologist, sits and watches the flood waters rising. The Dnipro River used to be 300-400 metres away, but after the dam at Nova Kakhovka was breached at 2.50am on Tuesday, it has burst into the city, flooding the first two or three blocks of the lowest lying quarter. Every half hour, Musian rises from her stool, carrying a square charcoal grey ruler. The water, she says, is rising “6 to 8cm every half hour” and is 3 metres above where it was before the dam burst. She phones through her figures to colleagues in the regional monitoring centre in nearby Mykolaiv. “When it goes back to 5cm an hour, and then four, we can start saying it has stabilised,” Musian continues, as she returns to her perch. But it is not clear when that will happen, not least because “we cannot say for sure how much water passed the dam, because it was controlled by the Russians”. For now, the river waters continue to rise visibly, in line it seems with Musian’s calculations, lapping farther up the dry streets, the latest avoidable tragedy to hit a city already blighted heavily by the 15-month war. As a scientist, what does she think of who did this? “It’s inhumane and dumb,” she says, and the culprits were “Russians who did this deliberately; I’m not thinking it was an accident.” Not everybody wanted to speak to the Guardian, but those who did knew who to blame – “Muscovites”, another resident said. The nearest Russian positions are only 2.5km away, and since Ukraine managed to liberate Kherson in November, the invaders have responded with incessant and at times deadly shelling. The low-lying area was already largely deserted and war damage is all too visible. Now it is being flooded in smelly, dirty, oil-coated river water. Read the full story: The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Milley was speaking with the Associated Press at the American Cemetery in Normandy, France, final resting place of almost 9,400 troops who died 79 years ago during the allied D-Day invasion on 6 June, 1944. He said it was up to Ukraine to announce whether its counteroffensive campaign has formally begun, but he said Ukrainian troops are ready for the fight: There’s activity throughout Russian-occupied Ukraine and fighting has picked up. It’s our estimation that the Ukrainian military is well prepared for whatever they do. They choose to fight in the offensive fight or in the defense, they’re well-prepared. As time goes on, he says, the fighting will vary: Like the battle of Normandy or any other major battle, warfare is a give and take. There will be days you see a lot of activity and there will be days you may see very little activity. There will be offensive actions and defense actions. So this will be a back-and-forth fight for a considerable length of time. You can read Milley’s D-Day anniversary interview with the AP here. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov is warning, again, of an “escalation” in the war in Ukraine if western allies provide F-16 fighter jets for use in the conflict. “We must keep in mind that one of the modifications of the F-16 can ‘accommodate’ nuclear weapons,” he said Tuesday in a speech at a military base in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, according to Reuters. “If they do not understand this, then they are worthless as military strategists and planners.” A number of nations, including the UK, have said in recent weeks that they want to help procure the fighter jets for Ukraine. Joe Biden has not committed to supplying aircraft, but has said the US will back an international effort to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them before doing so. John Kirby, White House coordinator of strategic communications for the National Security Council, spoke to reporters about F-16s on Tuesday: The purpose of providing advanced fighter aircraft is to help Ukraine defend itself defend its airspace and its territorial integrity, period. To Lavrov, he added: If you’re worried about Ukrainian military capabilities, then you should take your troops and leave Ukraine. Read more: Here’s where things stand on a day in the Ukraine war dominated by news of the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam following an explosion: Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he ‘does not understand’ how there are any doubts that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details,” he said. Here’s what you need to know about the dam: John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, has just spoken at the White House, and says the US is “assessing” the attack on the Nova Kakhovk dam. He was asked if the Biden administration considers it a war crime: I don’t have a determination on that to speak to today. I would just say we’re still trying to assess what happened here, but the Russians had illegally taken over that dam in the reservoir many months ago, and they were occupying it when this explosion happened. It’s very clear that the deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war, and in the additional protocol to the Geneva Convention that the Russians have themselves signed, destruction of civilian infrastructure, such as dams, are clearly articulated in their violations of that code. But again, we haven’t made a decision. We’re still talking to the Ukrainians. Kirby is also promising that more support for Ukraine will be coming in short order as a potential “repercussion” of the attack: I guarantee you, you’re gonna see additional security assistance packages in coming days and weeks. We’re going to continue to make sure that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield, as President Biden has said. If Russia is concerned about Ukrainian military capabilities, best thing that they can do would be to leave Ukraine. We have made our concerns about strikes inside Russia very clear to Ukrainian officials. They’ve acknowledged that and they have assured us that they won’t use US-made equipment to strike inside Russia. We don’t want to see the war escalate and, and there’s no apologies for that. But I won’t go into detail about the private discussions that we’re having with with Ukrainians. Reuters reports that Russia’s foreign ministry said it summoned Belgium’s ambassador on Tuesday to protest what it said was the use of “Belgian weapons” by pro-Ukraine militants that attacked Russian territory last month. This claim has not been independently verified. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said “35 to 70 towns will be flooded” along the Dnipro River after the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam. He also said there could be problems accessing clean drinking water while speaking at a briefing on Tuesday. “There will be big problems with drinking water even where there is no flooding. In the whole region,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Andrei Alexeyenko, chairman of the Russian-appointed government of Ukraine’s Kherson province, said the small town of Oleshky, which lies on the southern bank of the Dnipro River, was almost completely flooded. On Telegram, Alexeyenko posted videos showing one car standing in flood water up to the window and a lorry driving along a highway in water at least a foot deep. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU commission, said on Twitter that Russia would have to “pay for the war crimes committed in Ukraine”. She called the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam an “outrageous attack on civilian infrastructure [that] puts at risk thousands of people in the Kherson region.” She also confirmed that the EU has engaged its civil protection mechanism, which would “rapidly deliver” dirt water pumps, fire hoses, mobile water purification stations and boats to those affected by the dam explosion. NBC News reports that the US government has intelligence that indicates Russia is behind the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam, according to two US officials and one western official. President Joe Biden’s administration was working to declassify some of the intelligence and share it as early as Tuesday afternoon. The western official said the collapse appears likely to make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to conduct a river crossing. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, writes about the long-term impacts of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse The people living along Ukraine’s lower Dnipro river must contend with the immediate consequences of the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and flee for safety with whatever they can salvage, but the wider impact could make itself felt for generations. Downstream, the flood waters will subside somewhat as the surge reaches the Black Sea, but many of the villages and towns along the course of the Dnipro may not be habitable again unless and until a new dam is built. Thousands of homes and livelihoods have been swept away, along with countless domesticated and wild animals. The ecological trauma of such an inundation of water and silt has changed the landscape in an instant, wiping away islands and wetlands. It could take years if not decades for the fauna and flora to bounce back. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it the “largest human-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. It is the country’s misfortune to have also been the site of the Chornobyl disaster in 1986, arguably the last calamity on such a scale. Read more: Devastation from Kakhovka dam collapse could take decades to heal Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said he “did not understand” how there could be any doubt about whether Russian forces blew up the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement given to the Guardian, the senior aide said the dam could not have been destroyed through shelling or “any other external influence” - while another adviser to the president said the attack amounted to a war crime. In the statement, Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said: “At 2:50am this morning, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric Station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within. “We know that Russian troops had mined the hydroelectric Station in the early days of the full-scale invasion, so the pre-meditated blast is the only plausible explanation. Any alternative theories are nothing less than false Russian propaganda narratives.” Dasha Zarivna, a senior adviser in the Ukrainian presidential office, who was born and raised in Kherson, said: “The dam bombing is another unprecedented Russian war crime against Ukraine, which will have catastrophic consequences both for its population and other countries. These include environmental and economic consequences, a great risk from radiation and further serious disruption to food security. “Last October, President Zelenskiy said: ‘All the world leaders should let Russia understand that a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station will be equated to the use of weapons of mass destruction’. Now it has happened. World leaders must recognise the equivalence, and now must act decisively. It is essential to isolate the terrorist state as completely as possible. Any economic ties with Russia outside of humanitarian activities should be regarded as complicity in its war crimes.” The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, calls the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam a consequence of the Russian invasion, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters, Guterres said “one thing is clear, this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” “Attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure must stop. We must act to ensure accountability and respect for international humanitarian law,” he continued. Guterres added that it was a “monumental humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe.” “At least 16,000 people have already lost their homes – with safe and clean drinking water supplies at risk for many thousands more,” he said. He added that the UN was coordinating with the Ukrainian government to send support including drinking water and water purification tablets. Ukraine and Russia have both asked the UN security council to meet to discuss the incident. Here are some images of nearby residents wading through flood water after the Nova Kakhovka dam explosion. Reuters reports that Finland will expel nine diplomats working at the Russian embassy in Helsinki, accusing them of working on intelligence missions. “Their actions are contrary to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,” the president’s office said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that it would inform the Russian ambassador of the expulsions. The decision was made at a meeting between Finnish president Sauli Niinisto and the country’s ministerial committee on foreign and security policy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has blamed Russia for the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Speaking a townhall organised by broadcaster RTL, Scholz said: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Scholz also said that he intends to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, again, but added he had not done so for a long time and now was not the right time. Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP and leader of the liberal Holos party, said Ukraine was “one step away from a nuclear tragedy” after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. When asked about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station during an interview with GB News, Rudik said: “President Zelenskiy has warned the world in October last year that Russians have mined the Kakhovka power plant dam and that we were one step away from from the real tragedy. Right now, it happened. “For the last year we have been saying to the world the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is critical and again we are one step away from a nuclear tragedy. “If Russians are good at anything, they’re good at committing false flag operations. So let’s do possible and impossible things to make sure that we secure the station.” She added: “As of right now, the situation is not dangerous but we cannot guarantee that that will not change and we are calling for international support, for the UN to make sure that we install international inspectors at the nuclear plant because we do not know what’s going to happen there.” There has been some reaction to the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse on the other side of the Atlantic to Europe. Reuters reports that a Biden administration official said the US was “very concerned” after the Russian-controlled dam burst, and was trying to find out more about the potential impact. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the destruction “was another example of the horrific consequences of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine”. Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said the disaster was “absolutely devastating for lives and livelihoods across the region”. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for the collapse of the dam. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Tuesday of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as part of a plan to redeploy units from the nearby Kherson region for operations against Russian forces. Reuters reports that a Russian defence ministry statement signed by Shoigu said the dam breach and resultant flooding were designed to prevent Russia from attacking near Kherson, while allowing Ukraine to “transfer units and equipment from the Kherson front to the area of offensive operations”. The widening of the Dnipro River by the flood water from the destroyed dam is likely to make it harder for Ukrainian troops to form a bridgehead and oust Russian troops from the left bank of the river and the southern portion of the Kherson oblast that Russia occupies and has claimed to annex. [See Dan Sabbagh’s analysis of potential military impact of the dam’s destruction at 10.27 BST] Here are some images we have been sent over the news wires of Russians from the Shebekinsky district in Belgorod region receiving humanitarian aid after being evacuated. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as a distraction from ongoing border skirmishes in Russia’s Belgorod region, and suggested it will have a negative impact on Russia’s own ability to hold on to territory it occupies in Kherson region. On Telegram, Hanna Maliar posted: The Russian terrorist army has committed another crime that is capable of causing a serious ecological and humanitarian catastrophe. The purposeful undermining of the dam was carried out by the Russian occupiers in order to stop the process of de-occupation by the defence forces of Ukraine and shift the vector of public attention from the events taking place in the Belgorod region. Instead, the Russian occupiers had the opposite effect. Currently, civilians in the temporarily occupied settlements of Kherson region and Crimea are in a critical situation, as the destruction of the dam deprived them of fresh water. In addition, positions of Russian military units were flooded, which could lead to large-scale washing of Russian minefields and their detonation in a chaotic manner. Earlier, the governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, issued a denial in a video message that anti-Kremlin forces were in the settlement of Novaya Tavolzhanka, saying “there are many insinuations” but “today there is no enemy in the Belgorod region. People ask a lot about Novaya Tavolzhanka. There is no enemy on the territory of Novaya Tavolzhanka.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to say he met the pope’s peace envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi in Kyiv. Ukraine’s president wrote: We discussed the situation in Ukraine and humanitarian cooperation in the framework of the Ukrainian peace formula. Only united efforts, diplomatic isolation and pressure on Russia can influence the aggressor and bring a just peace to the Ukrainian land. I call on the Holy See to contribute to the implementation of the Ukrainian peace plan. Ukraine welcomes the readiness of other states and partners to find ways to peace, but since the war is on our territory, the algorithm for achieving peace can be Ukrainian only. Ukraine’s 10-point peace formula demands the withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations and prosecutions for Russia’s war leadership. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has claimed that a Ukrainian counteroffensive has been repulsed for three days by Russian forces who have inflicted more than 1,500 casualties in the process. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports: According to him, on 4 June, the armed forces of Ukraine, with the help of two brigades, tried to attack in five directions, they did not achieve success and lost 300 soldiers. On 5 June, the Kyiv regime attempted an offensive in seven directions with the forces of five brigades, was stopped and suffered significant losses, the minister said. According to him, during the attempted offensive on 5 June, Ukraine’s losses amounted to over 1,600 servicemen. The claims have not been independently verified. The president of Energoatom, Ukraine’s state energy firm, has reiterated that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the full-scale invasion. On Telegram, Petro Kotin is quoted as saying: Both in the pond itself at the ZNPP and in the so-called bowls of the basins … the normal water level is maintained, which was in them before the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam was blown up. He said that if the water level did fall, there were ways of topping it up. He was quoted as saying: Since September 2022, the power units of the ZNPP have not been operating, therefore active evaporation of water from the cooling pond does not occur, and there has been no need to feed it yet. And even if there will be no water in the Kakhovsky reservoir at all, the project provides measures to replenish it. One of the latter is the use of underground water from wells at the ZNPP site. Oleksandr Syenkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, has posted to say that flooding is not happening in his city, which sits on the Pivdennyi Buh River. The Pivdennyi Buh opens out into the Dnipro delta, where flood water from the Nova Kakhovka dam failure will be heading. He posted to Telegram to say: As of 2pm, the water level in the Mykolaiv area rose by 23cm. The good news: within an hour, that is, until 3pm, there were no changes. We will continue to monitor the situation. There is currently no threat of flooding. An air alert has been declared in Dnipropetrovsk region. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires of people, and their pets, being evacuated from Kherson. Oleksiy Arestovych, a former adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had no doubts that Russia was behind the dam explosion. Arestovych, a key Zelenskiy aide during the first year of the war, resigned from his official post in January after saying a Russian missile that killed dozens had in fact been shot down by Ukrainian air defence. Speaking on the sidelines of a forum of Russian opposition politicians in Brussels, he said: I’m 110% sure it was the Russians, you can tell even by the chronology of their announcements. At 6am their military bloggers and their Kherson ‘governor’ were saying ‘we’ve blown it up and we’ll flood their soldiers on the islands in the Dnipro’ and then there was a sudden change of message. There could be two reasons why they did it. One is simply to sabotage [our military’s] capability to cross the Dnipro. The second reason would be to show the world the possible consequences of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, to say ‘hold back the Ukrainians’ and show how bad the consequences could be. It fits very well with recent statements from China, from [Hungarian prime minister Viktor] Orbán, [Putin’s press secretary Dmitry] Peskov, that we are ready for a peaceful resolution. They are very scared of the counteroffensive. For now we don’t have enough facts to say which of the two reasons is the primary one. Pjotr Sauer has spoken to people living in Nova Kakhovka about the dam explosion: Two residents living in Nova Kakhovka, the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city where a dam was blown up overnight, told the Guardian that they heard loud explosions at about 2am. “I was woken up by a very loud noise,” said Tatyana, who declined to give her full name. She said she heard a noise that sounded like water flowing shortly after the initial blast. Yelena, another resident in the city, said she was woken up by what she thought was an explosion at about 2am. “We have become used to loud bangs, so I did not think it was anything serious,” she said. “It is hard to know for sure where the blast came from.” Vladimir Leontiev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, said the town had been “completely flooded” hours after the accident. Videos on social media showed swans swimming through the flooded central square of the city. Leontiev told a Russian-state news channel that the water in the town rose to over 36 feet, and some people along the riverbank were being evacuated. Some locals on the ground described a chaotic scene. “Everyone is left to fend for themselves, there is no organised evacuation,” said Gleb, who was looking for ways to leave the city. Russia’s vocal military bloggers and other war hawks have been spinning the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovska as either a Ukrainian diversion or a tactic meant to sweep away Russian defences on the left bank of the Dnipro River before their counteroffensive. Igor Girkin, a former leader of Russian proxy forces in east Ukraine, wrote on his popular Telegram blog that the dam’s failure could “wash away our forces on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro below [Nova Kakhovka]. That would also ‘wash away’ all of our defensive fortifications, all the minefields, all the warehouses with ammunition would be flooded, it would fully or partially destroy all the property that they didn’t manage to pack up and ship away (and that would be quite a bit, unfortunately).” Although they often come into conflict with the military, most seem to have endorsed the Kremlin line of “deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side”, as claimed by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. But others have deviated from the party line. In a video, Yegor Guzenko, a popular commentator who has fought in the war, smiled broadly as he said he had predicted many times before that the dam would eventually become a target. “I won’t say who blew it up,” he said. “But from a tactical point of view, the [Ukrainians] can forget about the offensive in the Kherson direction. “If the evacuation [of Russian military personnel] goes well and without losses then we can blow up all the fucking dams on the Dnipro River if it fucking suits us.” Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, and Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, describe the devastation unleashed by the collapse of Nova Kakhovka dam. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the water from the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while countless pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic impact on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream.

An hour ago, two police officers were wounded in the area. Shelling continues at the moment,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. European leaders must not be naive to the divisions Russian propaganda can cause in communities hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees, a special adviser to the EU has said. Unveiling a report on how Ukrainians fleeing the war have fared in the EU, Lodewijk Asscher said that “solidarity is alive and kicking” but added that societies need to be on guard against “solidarity fatigue”, particularly towards more vulnerable refugees. Around 4 million refugees remain in the EU, down from a peak of 16 million, with 11 million returning to Ukraine and 1 million moving to other countries, mainly Canada and the US, says the report, titled Integration of People Fleeing Ukraine in the EU. Of the 3.8 million seeking protection under special EU laws, more than half were hosted by Germany and Poland, which accounted for 2 million refugees. The highest number per capita of domestic population are being hosted by Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Russia says it has launched a criminal investigation into the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Tuesday that it had launched a criminal investigation into the overnight destruction of the hydroelectric dam which sits in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Kherson region. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has called for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure” on the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement, the ministry also called for the UN atomic agency’s board of governors to discuss the incident and demanded new sanctions on Russia from the G7 and the EU, with a particular focus on the Russian missile industry and nuclear sector. The ministry also called on the EU to engage its the civil protection mechanism which can deliver aid to those in need following a natural or human-made disaster. The EU has condemned the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam, calling it a “horrific and barbaric” escalation of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Peter Stano, the European Commission’s spokesperson, said: ”“This is a new sign of escalation, bringing the horrific and barbaric nature of Russian aggression against Ukraine to unprecedented levels.” Vladimir Leontyev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, called the breach of the dam in the city a “terrorist act” and blamed Ukraine, Reuters reports. Speaking to Russian state television, Leontyev said: “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of sabotaging the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, which sits in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, to distract attention from a supposedly “faltering” counteroffensive against Russian forces, Reuters reports. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. He said the destruction of the dam was intended to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir through the North Crimean Canal, and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. “Apparently, this sabotage is also connected with the fact that having started large-scale offensive actions two days ago, now the Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals – these offensive actions are faltering.” Asked about Ukrainian allegations that Russia had destroyed the dam, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” Peskov said the sabotage could “potentially have very serious consequences for several tens of thousands of residents of the region”. Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam a war crime. She said on Twitter that the “terrorist state Russia has now turned water into a weapon”. “Destroying [Nova Kakhovka] dam is a war crime affecting countless civilians and bringing ecocide and mass destruction,” she said. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam “a fundamentally new stage of Russian aggression”. He said on Twitter that Russia had openly declared “its true goal – the destruction of Ukraine, killing Ukrainians, destroying the economy and life support structures.” The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Ukrahydroenergo said the hydoelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken by bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and to other Ukrainian cities including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. Occupying Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Vladimir Leontyev told the Tass news agency it was a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them”. Leontyev said part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons, and about 300 houses had been evacuated. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, told the broadcaster Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” Here is an updated report from our video team on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The chief of the UN’s atomic agency, Rafael Grossi, has issued a statement about the Nova Kakhovka dam destruction and its potential impact on nuclear safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). He said a planned visit to the plant would go ahead next week, and called on both sides in the conflict to do nothing to further endanger safety at the plant, drawing particular attention to the on-site cooling pond. The IAEA’s director general said: The IAEA staff on the site have been informed that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam is currently leading to about 5cm/hour reduction in the height of the reservoir. The main line of cooling water is fed from the reservoir and pumped up through channels near the thermal power plant to the site. It is estimated that the water through this route should last for a few days. Water in the reservoir was at around 16.4 metres at 8am. If it drops below 12.7 metres then it can no longer be pumped. The ZNPP is making all efforts to pump as much water into its cooling channels and related systems as possible. In addition, non-essential consumers of water are being stopped at ZNPP to reduce the consumption of water. ZNPP management is discussing further measures to be implemented. There are a number of alternative sources of water. A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir. As the reactors have been shut down for many months, it is estimated that this pond will be sufficient to provide water for cooling for some months. The agency will confirm this very shortly. It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that. My trip to ZNPP next week was planned and now it is essential. I will go. The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine will not prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing, Reuters reports a senior Ukrainian commander said on Tuesday. “As for preventing our offensive actions, the military command has taken into full account such treacherous enemy actions, and it should not prevent our advance in those directions where there may be spillage of water,” Serhiy Naev, commander of the joint forces of the armed forces of Ukraine, was quoted as saying by the state news agency Ukrinform. While attention has understandably focused on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, clear-up operations have also been carried out in Kharkiv after a Russian strike. Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, offers this analysis of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam: Although it remains not yet confirmed exactly how the dam was blown, it is the Russian military who, cynically, would probably think they have the most to gain. Ukraine will have to deal with a destroyed dam plus the long-term environmental and humanitarian consequences. Experts fear it will wipe out islands in the delta and low-lying settlements, mostly on the southern bank. There are about 16,000 people estimated to be in the critical zone on the Ukrainian side of the river. Such predictable impacts mean it is likely to be a war crime, as defined in the Geneva conventions, if its breach causes “release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses” to civilians. If it is the case, as initially reported, that water levels have been built up to a 30-year high in recent weeks, that could suggest a degree of forethought that would only bolster a future legal case. The obvious military point is that Russia feared an amphibious attack across the Dnipro delta. Some of Ukraine’s armed forces have been receiving marine training from the UK, suggesting that, at the very least, Kyiv wanted to keep the option open of trying what would have been a relative risky attack that, if successful, could have opened up the option of a more direct strike towards Crimea – or diverting Russian forces away from the southern front further east in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Russian defensive positions downstream, as mapped from satellite imagery, have already been concentrated on higher ground. The breach of the dam is an uncertain event, and it will take some days before it is clear where the new river line will be – and whether the fortifications are in appropriate positions. Widening the Dnipro River from hundreds of metres to several kilometres makes the task of crossing in strength all the harder at the delta. Russia still has its air force available to make a river crossing difficult, and as the battle for Kherson in November showed, it is difficult to keep a bridgehead across the country’s central river supplied. However, it is also the case that the river is likely to narrow upstream, south of Zaporizhzhia. That may also create some military opportunities for Kyiv. What is certain is that as with the impact on civilians and the environment, all the consequences are some way from being played out. Russia blew up the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine to prevent Ukrainian forces from crossing the Dnipro River, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command said on Tuesday. “This is a hysterical reaction,” Natalia Humeniuk told an online briefing, Reuters reports. “They were aware that the movement of the defence forces would take place, and in this way tried to influence the defence forces so that the crossing of the [river], which they feared, would not happen.” There are limited crossing points over the river. Ukraine holds the right bank, to the north, while Russia continues to occupy the left bank and the south of Kherson oblast. A state of emergency has been declared by local Moscow-backed authorities in the Nova Kakhovka district of the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Kherson region after the dam breach, Reuters reports, citing Tass. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has criticised the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, tweeting: The destruction of the Kakhovka dam puts thousands of civilians in danger, leaving many with no homes and in dire humanitarian need. Civilians and civilian infrastructure are not a target. Its social media team are maybe not entirely in lockstep with that of its parent organisation UN, which has run into vocal social media criticism for earlier using Twitter to promote today as “Russian Language Day”. The Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko was among those to reply to the tweet, asking: “Do you want to write anything about the explosion of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station? Or will you celebrate the Russian language day?” The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is in Ukraine, where he has been visiting the Halo Trust in the Kyiv region, an NGO that works in demining. Our community team are asking for your witness reports of the aftermath of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam if you live in the region. Details of how to contact them can be found here: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted details from the emergency national council meeting (NSDC) this morning to respond to the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Ukraine’s president posted to Telegram to say: I held an urgent meeting of the national security council. Overnight [at] 02.50am, Russian terrorists carried out an internal detonation of the structures of the Kakhovskaya HPP [hydroelectric power plant]. About 80 settlements are in the flooding zone. It was ordered to carry out evacuation from risk areas and to provide drinking water to all cities and villages that were supplied with water from the Kakhovsky reservoir. We do everything to save people. All services, military, government, are involved. At the NSDC meeting, a set of international and security measures was agreed upon to hold Russia accountable for this terrorist attack. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and offered Moldova’s support. She tweeted: I strongly condemn the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam this morning. Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructure amounts to war crimes. President Zelenskiy, we stand ready to provide assistance in response to the floods and support efforts to mitigate the impact. The Russian military is shelling Kherson with artillery, while the population is being evacuated in the city, the ministry of internal affairs reported. Two police officers received shrapnel wounds, Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image that has come through of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Video is circulating on social media that appears to show the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant has been completely submerged by rising waters of the Dnipro River. The Guardian has not independently verified the video. The Telegram channel of Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying some quotes from the Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo. It reports: Large-scale evacuation of people will not be required in the Kherson region after the destruction of the structures of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, said Saldo. The destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station led to the flow of a large, but not critical amount of water along the [Dnipro] River, this will not prevent the Russian forces from protecting the left bank, Saldo noted. It also quotes the Russian-imposed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, claiming: The situation at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station is a consequence of Ukrainian armed forces strikes on the station, which have continued daily since the summer of 2022, the authorities said. The Kakhovka HPP continues to collapse, water is discharged uncontrollably, the head of Nova Kakhovka said. Shebekino district in Russia’s Belgorod region is being shelled, local authorities told residents on Tuesday. Reuters reports that in messages via social media, residents were warned to take cover in cellars. The destruction of a dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine is an attempt by Moscow to “raise the stakes” in its full-scale invasion and stoke fears of a nuclear catastrophe, a senior Ukrainian official said on Tuesday. “Today, the world must understand that this is an attempt by terrorists to raise the stakes and scare everyone with a possible nuclear disaster,” Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration, wrote on Telegram, Reuters reports. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 120 miles downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement saying the situation at the plant was under control, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said its experts at the site were monitoring the situation and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk”. But there are long-term concerns over safety and the possibility of the plant operating again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C, so that it will be easier to restart when conditions allowed, and to supply hot water to the neighbouring town of Enerhodar. Oleksiy, who left after the Russians occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should now be shut down, and that the plant had sufficient resources for now to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was current at 16.6 metres, “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP where water can be maintained above the reservoir level and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if the ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is senior research associate at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir that had been created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. Budjeryn had another sobering thought about the implications. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.” Tass reports that the Russian-imposed head of the settlement of Nova Kakhovka says the water has risen by 10 metres. Here is some of the earlier video footage of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, carries this latest report on the consequences of the damaged to the Nova Kakhovka dam: Due to the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP, there is a threat of flooding up to 80 settlements, prime minister [Denys] Shmyhal said. As of now, more than 10 settlements have been completely or partially flooded, reported the Kherson regional authority. About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region. Local authorities are evacuating residents from potential flood zones. At 12pm an evacuation train will leave Kherson for Mykolaiv. Suspilne also provided this graphic showing the likely affected settlements. Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, has issued a strong statement after the destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant, which Ukrhydroenergo claims was destroyed by an explosion from inside the turbine hall. Kostin tweeted: Russia can only destroy and kill. And will stop at nothing. Blowing up the Kakhovskaya HPP is another proof of this and an international crime. Today, the cornered occupiers are killing and leaving thousands of people homeless, whom they wanted to “integrate into the Russian Federation” just yesterday. Cannibalistic “scorched earth” tactics worthy of Hitler. Anyone who still thinks that it is possible to talk about something with an aggressor should remember the streams of dirty water that wash away the homes of people who were sleeping peacefully. The end of the criminal Russian regime can only be one – defeat and a tribunal. The Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied settlement of Nova Kakhovk near the damaged dam has blamed Ukraine for the incident. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carrying quotes from Vladimir Leontyev for Russia’s domestic audience, in which it claims: Leontyev said that there was no explosion at the station, but night strikes led to the destruction and water began to uncontrollably be discharged downstream. According to him, the armed forces of Ukraine continue to shell the city. The blow to the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, presumably, was delivered from an MLRS [multiple launch rocket system]. Leontyev said that it is still impossible to predict whether the Kakhovskaya HPP will continue to collapse. According to him, the hydroelectric power plant has suffered serious damage and it is presumably impossible to repair it. As the mayor added, the destruction at the station will lead to problems in the delivery of water to the Crimea. At the same time, the destruction does not pose any critical danger for the Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant]. Leontyev called the incident a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them.” He said that the consequences will still be studied, the main task now is to help citizens. Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine “in a panic”, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Tuesday. “The occupiers blew up the dam of the Kakhovka reservoir in a panic – this is an obvious act of terrorism and a war crime, which will be evidence in an international tribunal,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on Telegram. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction of the dam in southern Ukraine on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he told Reuters. “We’ll continue to assess the developing situation, but the best thing Russia could do now is withdraw their troops immediately.” Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, has told Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” A Russian-installed official in the town of Nova Kakhovka said on Tuesday residents of about 300 houses had been evacuated after the nearby dam was breached, state-owned news agency Tass reported. Reuters reports that Tass also quoted Nova Kakhovka’s Russian-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, as saying that part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant was completely destroyed “as a result of the explosion of the engine room from the inside” and is not repairable. It cites Ukrahydroenergo. More details soon … Julian Borger and Dan Sabbagh report from Kyiv for the Guardian: The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. As aerial footage circulated on social media, showing most of the dam wall washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream, the army’s Southern Operational Command put up a Facebook post accusing “Russian occupation troops” of blowing up the hydroelectric dam. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken to bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and on to other Ukrainian cities. The disaster happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. Local Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied that anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday in the wake of the disaster. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the river downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people would lose their homes. There could be two further dramatic side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could be severely affected. Read more here: Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and president of the Kyiv School of Economics, notes that the peak water from the breach of the dam would be expected at 11am local time (9am BST). He suggests that the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River is more at risk. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory, but that “everything is under control”. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the Ukrainian military claims to have shot down a Russian Ka-52 helicopter in the direction of Shakhtarsk on Monday, citing the general staff. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is my colleague Jonathan Yerushalmy on why the dam is so significant and poses such a threat: The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The reservoir it contains holds an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Soon after Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, the head of the Kherson region urged residents to evacuate the area, warning that “water will reach a critical level in five hours”. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also probably wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. Read more here: Nova Kakhovka Dam – everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and an adviser to the interior ministry, has suggested on social media that about 16,000 people may be affected by any potential flood from the breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The video footage in his tweet has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has said that “only force” can solve the “global threat” posed by Russia, in a message on the Telegram app. He posted: The destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP is the largest man-made disaster in the world in recent decades, which kills the environment and will negatively affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the years to come. The insane goal of stopping the defence forces’ advance and avoiding defeat and disgrace drives Kremlin criminals. They are willing to do anything to raise the stakes in this war. Today’s Russia is a global threat. Only force can solve this problem. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam who will bring you the latest from the aftermath of this very distressing development in the war. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”: The Financial Times’ Moscow bureau chief has shared modelling done previously on how the dam’s destruction is likely to affect Kherson: Prof Hubert Chanson, from the University of QLD School of Civil Engineering, expects that a flood of water from the destroyed Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine will put people at risk of drowning and slow military action further downstream. “Anyone living in low-lying areas downstream of the dam could be drowned,” he says. “Significant flooding is likely to happen, depending on the volume of the dam at the time. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the destruction of the dam is to slow down military action further downstream. A large body of water behind a low-lying dam could cause a long-lasting flood that is not going to end in a couple of days.” Restoration of the dam is “not going to be a quick fix”, Chanson says. Repair will include blocking the bridge and the opening in the dam, typically by dumping rocks or concrete blocks. “To do so would be a matter of civil engineering,” he says. “You can only do so if in a secure environment, if one party is in charge of the dam and has access to the dam site.” Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company, has responded to the damage to the dam, saying it “may have negative consequences for the [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant], but the situation is under control”. It has blamed the dam’s flooding on Russian forces, saying, “On the night of June 6, 2023, the Russian invaders blew up the dam of the Kakhovskaya HPP.” It explained that the “rapidly decreasing” water levels in the reservoir posed an “additional threat to the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP.” For now, however, the nuclear power station’s cooling pond was full, it said. Water from the Kakhovsky reservoir is necessary for the station to receive power for turbine capacitors and safety systems of the ZNPP. The station’s cooling pond is now full: as of 8am, the water level is 16.6 metres, which is sufficient for the station’s needs. Energoatom monitors the situation and follows the actions of workers at the ZNPP together with other international organisations present at the plant, in particular, the IAEA. Any changes will be promptly notified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that what he called the “destruction” of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” He added: “All services are working. I have convened the national security and defence council.” In May, residents in a nearby village reported ongoing flooding which they blamed on Russia’s occupation of Nova Kakhovka. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, locals said the water level had begun to rise in April, sometimes by up to 30cm a day, and had remained elevated since. Ukrainian officials said the “rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam”. But they added that they were unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because they did not have access themselves. A Russian energy official also warned in May that the dam risked being overwhelmed by record-high water levels. This unverified footage reportedly shows the view from the top of the dam’s generator hall: If you’re just joining us, a vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. You can get in touch with me on Twitter here. Here is what we know so far: Unverified videos on social media showed water surging through the remains of the dam, with bystanders expressing their shock. Ukraine’s national police urged people in affected villages to evacuate. The police force named the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson – Korabel Island. “Units of the national police and the state emergency service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River” the police force said on Telegram. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will hold an emergency meeting, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said on Twitter on Tuesday. The Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. The dam, 30 metres tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka [dam] was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the south command of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling, while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. Russia’s destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine represents an “ecocide”, but national and regional officials are working to ensure the safety of local residents, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration said on Tuesday. Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram that Russia’s actions also present a threat to the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, without elaborating Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Nova Kakhovka dam has been earmarked as a potential target for both its strategic importance - as well as the damage that its destruction would unleash. It was captured by Russia at the start of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, and has been held by it ever since. In October, as Ukraine was in the midst of reclaiming large parts of occupied Kherson, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to warn Russia not to blow up the dam, warning that it would flood a large area of southern Ukraine. At the time, he claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives inside the dam. Zelenskiy said “destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,” and compared such an act to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine military intelligence said “the scale of the ecological disaster [would] go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”. At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it. After Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November, images emerged of some significant damage to the dam. Russia had accused Ukraine of shelling the dam in its campaign to recapture Kherson. Here is more video of the dam flooding, via the Kyiv post: Ukraine’s National Security Council has announced that Zelenskiy will hold an emergency meeting over the dam blast. On 25 May Reuters reported that Ukrhydroenergo, which owns the dam, had blamed high water levels in the Dnieper river on Russia. “The rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam,” state company said in a statement. It said the 17-metre (56-foot) level in the pool held back by the dam was a metre higher than normal for this time of year, Reuters reported. But the company said it was unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because it did not have access itself. The dam was at “unprecedentedly” high levels before today, the Washington Post’s Evan Hill reports: Washington Post investigative journalist Evan Hill has shared satellite images showing what appears to be evidence that a section of the dam was damaged or destroyed on 5 June: Here is a larger image showing the dam on 28 May this year: And yesterday at 12:15pm local time: Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. Here is the unverified footage of the dam flooding being shared widely on social media, including by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine: Ukraine’s National Police force are asking people in affected villages to evacuate. The Police said on Telegram a moment ago: Units of the National Police and the State Emergency Service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River, namely: the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson - Korabel Island. The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: 🔹turn off all electrical appliances 🔹take documents and essentials 🔹take care of loved ones and pets 🔹 follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, has posted more details about evacuations to Telegram. Residents in what he called the “danger zone” were also urged to turn off electrical appliances. Gerashchenkosaid: ❗️ In the Kherson region, the settlements on the right bank of the Dnieper have been named as being at risk of flooding Evacuation of the civilian population from potential flood zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River is underway, namely: ▪️ The village of Nikolaevka, ▪️ Olgovka, ▪️ Лёво, ▪️ Tyaginka, ▪️ Ivanivka, ▪️ Ivanovka, ▪️Tokarevka, ▪️ Pridneprovskoye, ▪️Partly the city of Kherson - the island of Korabel.

Here is a summary of what we know so far, via Reuters: A vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. The dam, 30 metres (yards) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnieper river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and also supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka (dam) was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnieper River, holding back an enormous reservoir of water. The dam itself is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The enormous reservoir that it contains holds about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south - which was annexed by Russia in 2014 - as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydro-electric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. The UK ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, has retweeted a post calling what has happened at the dam “An appalling act of ecocide by the Russian regime”. The large Nova Kakhovka Dam in the Russia-controlled parts of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was destroyed and the territory is flooding, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source close to the matter. A second state news agency RIA cited the Moscow-installed Mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying that the upper part of the dam was destroyed by shelling. The mayor earlier denied that that the dam had been blown up. Tass then quoted him as saying that the destruction of the dam was a “serious terrorist act”. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian were able to independently verify the reports. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson region, has posted a video to Telegram in which he says that as a result of the damage to the Nova Kahhovka dam, “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours” and that evacuations have begun. The translation of the video was obtained via Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Gerashchenko posted the video from Prokudin’s Telegram, with the text: The water will reach a critical level in 5 hours, the evacuation has begun - the head of Kherson OVA As Alexander Prokudin reported, local residents have already begun to be evacuated from potential flood areas. He confirmed that the [Russians] had blown up the Kakhovskaya HPP and called for them to leave the dangerous places as soon as possible. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnieper River was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. The Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine’s Kherson region was blown up by Russian forces, the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified,” the command said on its Facebook page. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. In breaking news: Ukraine’s Southern Military command has accused Russia of “blowing up” the Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson, “likely” causing flooding. The Guardian has not been able to verify the claim. Unverified video footage shared on social media on Tuesday morning appeared to show a large amount of water flowing out of the dam. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the dam was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian have been able to independently verify the reports. We’ll have more information shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has confirmed that in some areas Kyiv’s forces are moving to “offensive actions”, heightening speculation that a counteroffensive is close to launch. Russia claimed to have repelled a “major offensive” in the Donetsk region and to have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops, but the claims could not be independently verified. The defence ministry in Moscow said Ukraine had attacked with six mechanised and two tank battalions from two brigades. The ministry claimed 250 Ukrainian troops had been killed, and 16 tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles and 21 armoured personnel carriers destroyed. It also claimed that Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of general staff, had been near the frontlines when the attack was repelled. The Russian defence ministry has consistently made exaggerated claims about the casualties its forces have inflicted. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed on Monday what he called “the news we have been waiting for” from troops in Bakhmut, but gave no further details. “I am grateful to each soldier, to all our defenders, men and women, who have given us today the news we have been waiting for. Fine job, soldiers in the Bakhmut sector!” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. The US imposed sanctions on members of a Russian intelligence-linked group for their role in Moscow’s efforts to destabilise democracy and influence elections in Moldova, the Treasury department said. The sanctions target seven individuals, several of whom maintain ties to Russian intelligence services, the department said. They include the group’s leader, Konstantin Prokopyevich Sapozhnikov, who organised the plot to destabilise the government of Moldova, which borders Ukraine, earlier this year. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. They discussed preparations for the Nato summit in Lithuania next month and Ukraine’s plan for ending Russia’s invasion. During the meeting, Cleverly said: “Ukraine will win this war and can count on our support.” Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, said three people were killed in the region yesterday as a result of Russian attacks. Two drones have fallen on the M3 Ukraine highway, in the Russian region of Kaluga, just south of Moscow, the region’s governor has said. There was no detonation and the sites have been cordoned off by investigators, said governor Vladislav Shapsha. Poland’s agriculture minister has received a draft regulation from the European Commission extending a ban on Ukrainian grain imports until 15 September, he said on Monday. Belgium will ask Ukraine for clarification on reports that rifles made in Belgium had been used by pro-Ukrainian forces to fight Russian troops inside Russia’s western border, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"Russia’s Gazprom to make drastic cut to Europe’s gas supply from Wednesday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday","fields":{"headline":"Russia’s Gazprom to make drastic cut to Europe’s gas supply from Wednesday","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Russian state-controlled energy company Gazprom has announced a drastic cut to gas deliveries through its main pipeline to Europe from Wednesday, prompting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accuse Moscow of waging a “gas war”. The Russian gas export monopoly said it was halting the operation of one of the last two operating turbines due to the “technical condition of the engine”, cutting daily gas deliveries via the Nord Stream pipeline to 33m cubic metres a day – about 20% of the pipeline’s capacity. “We are monitoring the situation very closely in close exchange with the federal network agency and the gas crisis team,” the German economy ministry said in a statement on Monday after Gazprom’s announcement. “According to our information, there is no technical reason for a reduction in deliveries.” Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address on Monday, said the move was deliberate and urged the European Union to agree tougher sanctions against Russia. “All this is done by Russia on purpose to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an open gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe,” he said. Moscow’s “gas blackmail of Europe” represented “an incentive for the EU’s eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger,” he said. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline resumed pumping last week, after a 10-day maintenance break, but the European Commission has warned that a complete gas shut down by Russia is likely. The announcement came as EU governments sparred over a plan for a 15% gas savings target intended to avoid a winter crisis if the Kremlin turns off the taps to Europe. The EU’s goal is to use less gas now to build storage for winter. The EU executive last week accused Moscow of using energy as a “weapon” and called on 27 member states to accept a voluntary 15% gas savings target, which could become mandatory if Brussels declares a supply emergency. EU officials had hoped the bloc’s 27 energy ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday would rubber stamp the 15% gas savings plan. Instead countries from all corners of Europe have raised objections, led by Spain and Portugal, who are relatively isolated from the EU’s gas pipeline network. The proposals have been seen as designed for Germany, which faces energy rationing as it scrambles to undo decades of dependence on Russian gas. In an echo of the bruising debates of the eurozone crisis ten years ago, where arguments raged over bailouts, debt and blame, southern countries suggested their citizens should not have to make sacrifices for the past policies of others. Spain’s deputy prime minister Teresa Ribera said last week her country was being asked to make a “disproportionate sacrifice”, as she pointed to investments her country had made on liquefied natural gas infrastructure, costs that had fallen on Spanish companies and consumers, she said. “Unlike other countries, we Spaniards have not lived beyond our means from an energy point of view,” Ribera said in unusually pointed comments. Portugal was “totally against” the proposals its energy minister, João Galamba, told local media last week, saying they did not address the needs of Spain or Portugal, which have little gas interconnection with the rest of Europe. The Iberian countries are also using more gas to generate electricity because a fierce drought has reduced hydropower production. Greece also opposes the 15% EU-wide target, which it argues overburdens its economy and consumers. Meanwhile, Poland has raised concerns about its energy security. A Polish official said Warsaw would “not agree to any solutions that may lead to the use of Polish natural gas reserves for the needs of other member states”. France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland were among the countries that opposed giving the commission the power to declare a supply emergency. Instead it is proposed that EU member states make that critical decision. Under revised proposals, which were still being discussed by EU deputy ambassadors on Monday, countries can get an exemption from the 15% target if they are not connected to the gas interconnector system of any other member states. The target can also be eased if countries offer to send gas to a member state in need. EU sources rejected suggestions the plan was designed for Germany, arguing all member states would feel the economic pain of a Russian gas shut down. “I don’t buy the logic that all this is for Germany,” said one senior EU official. “It’s not about who will be hit first because if [a supply shock] hits then I think the problem will be immediately shared. We are in the internal market and … the pain will be substantial for all member states.” The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week said it was likely the Kremlin would order a complete shutdown of Russian gas to the EU, dealing a hammer blow to the European single market. EU officials have suggested countries speed up the shift to renewables, but have also said states could consider delay to exiting coal and nuclear power. Belgium’s government announced last week it had reached a political agreement to extend the life of two nuclear power plants by 10 years, citing national security. The Doel 4 and Tihange 3 reactors will be restarted in 2026, as the Belgian government revised a plan to exit all nuclear power by 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","fields":{"headline":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Even for an executive in the eye of the gathering storm that is the energy crisis, Chris O’Shea seems remarkably busy. The chief executive of Centrica bustles on to our videocall from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, after battling traffic on his way from a hydrogen project in the Humber. Afterwards he’s off to the coast, to check progress on reopening the massive Rough undersea gas storage facility – a key part of ensuring the UK will be able to keep the lights on as Russia throttles gas supplies. He has also found time to watch Liz Truss announce her energy bills bailout on the TV. Her plan involves reworking power supply contracts, a measure O’Shea, along with other industry leaders, has been pushing for. Tomorrow brings an early morning trip to Brigg power station in north Lincolnshire, where the company is building a 50-megawatt battery storage plant. He’s not complaining, though. “Having to work two jobs to make ends meet, that’s a struggle,” says O’Shea, crunching on a bag of salt- and-vinegar crisps as he hurries his lunch. “It’s a massive privilege to be in the position I’m in.” *** CV Age 48 Family Married with three children.

Best advice he’s been given “You’ve two eyes, two ears and one mouth: try to use them in proportion.” Phrase he overuses “Do you have five minutes?” How he relaxes Spending time with friends and family; running. *** Centrica is the largest UK company supplying power into its home market, with 8 million domestic and retail customers. It owns British Gas, the former state monopoly, and is valued at more than £5bn. Its stock has risen more than 70% over the past year, thanks to surging gas prices, and half-year profits were a thumping £1.3bn. Its assets span gasfields in the North and Irish seas, solar projects and a stake in UK nuclear power. O’Shea shrugs off public anger that has seen him vilified for high pay (potentially £4.26m this year), for still working some of the time from home and for cutting jobs – he even had faeces sent to his home near Reading: “It would be very self-indulgent to feel sorry for myself. I’m in a very fortunate position.” Later, he adds: “My brother took his life when he was 25 – that is the toughest challenge I have overcome. A personal tragedy puts everything else into perspective.” O’Shea joined the British Gas owner as finance chief in 2018, moving to the top job in April 2020. Since then, he’s navigated Covid, slashed 5,000 jobs at the former state monopoly, and taken on 800,000 customers from suppliers put out of business by surging gas prices. Now, he’s in talks with government over a voluntary profits cap and is eyeing a push into more nuclear power. Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s ageing nuclear facilities through a joint venture with France’s EDF. Having flirted with selling that stake, the British firm dropped that plan last year. Despite pulling out of the project to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset with EDF a decade ago, Centrica has been linked with investing in its sister site in Suffolk, Sizewell C. O’Shea confirms this interest for the first time, saying he is seriously considering investing in the project. In one of his final acts as prime minister, Boris Johnson said that Britain was “putting up to £700m” into the project, which could cost £30bn to build. The government and EDF are understood to be finalising a deal that would see each take a 50% stake in a new vehicle while external investors are sought, pushing out China’s CGN in the process. “I’m very interested in understanding the terms of the agreement between EDF and the government,” says O’Shea. “If those terms are attractive, I would very much like to be involved in Sizewell C, but I need to see the terms and have a conversation, obviously, with my colleagues on the board. But it’s fully aligned with our strategy.” He says “some of our fears have come to pass in terms of cost overruns and delays” at Hinkley Point C, but backs EDF. “I’ve been in large capital projects myself. Things go wrong. But at good companies, when they go wrong, you learn from them.” O’Shea says he is “committed to delivering decarbonisation” by the government net zero target date of 2050 or earlier. He says: “The reality is, I believe in a decarbonised UK: that requires more wind power, more solar power, more nuclear power, and decarbonised gas.” He is even tempted by a project to build a fleet of mini nuclear plants in the UK. “I am interested in understanding a bit more about the small modular reactors that Rolls-Royce is developing. So that’s something that we would potentially look at as well.” A push into costly nuclear projects would be a bold new frontier for a self-confessed “disciplined” numbers man. Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, O’Shea studied accountancy in Glasgow, where he had moved after his parents’ business hit hard times. He has rattled through a series of finance roles with corporate big beasts including Ernst &amp; Young, Shell, BG Group and Smiths Group, and done stints in the US and Nigeria, where his uncle was once a priest.

He’s not too downcast after Celtic FC, whose matches he still watches with schoolmates, lost to Real Madrid. Not content just to be a spectator, he’s preparing to run the Berlin marathon this month. Despite Truss’s intervention, this winter remains uncertain for many. O’Shea urges customers to wait until they receive their bills before inundating call centres. He says Downing Street should be “applauded” for the support, adding: “This is a two-year temporary programme, and it gives us time to fix the underlying causes of the issue.” His solution is to voluntarily give the government a slice of the outsize profits Centrica has made from its nuclear stake and its North Sea gas operations, to pay for lower bills. He is in negotiations with civil servants now about how to do that. Isn’t this merely a strategy to avoid being slapped with a more punitive windfall tax? “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off,” he says. “It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” In one of her first acts as prime minister, Truss reopened the door to fracking. O’Shea welcomes the new policy, which will allow companies to drill – if they win approval from local residents. “It’s absolutely right: you should look at it because, again, it helps with energy security.” But would he oppose fracking near his own home? “If I was publicly in support of fracking, I couldn’t find it in my conscience to object.” • This article was amended on 11 &amp; 12 September: to correct details about O’Shea’s pay and to note that he was speaking from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, not Easington, County Durham as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-02T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Johnson to ‘bet big’ on nuclear energy despite Sunak’s reservations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","fields":{"headline":"Johnson to ‘bet big’ on nuclear energy despite Sunak’s reservations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson wants his promised energy security strategy to “bet big” on nuclear despite Rishi Sunak’s reservations – but he has cooled on more onshore wind turbines in England amid a Conservative backlash. The prime minister is determined to press ahead with plans to build up to eight new nuclear power stations even though the chancellor has concerns about the cost, projected to reach more than £13bn. It is understood the energy strategy, expected to be announced next week, is likely to contain targets for nuclear but will not put a figure on the cost. Johnson will also commit to a “stretching” target on offshore wind, according to a Whitehall source. But he is now said to be less enthusiastic about the possibilities of onshore wind in England, believing Scotland offers a better landscape for new turbines. One ally of the prime minister said he would “not really [be] pushing for onshore wind in England” although it would “be in the strategy as an option where people want it, which realistically means in Scotland”. Johnson and Sunak are understood to have discussed the new strategy this week, which was commissioned to ensure security of supply amid soaring gas prices fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The document was delayed owing to a row over the scale of its ambitions on nuclear, but is now likely to be published at the end of next week. Sunak will be in London for the launch of the strategy. However, he is reported to be going on holiday in California, where he has a second home, at some point over parliamentary recess, despite rising pressure over the lack of measures to help with the cost of living and energy bills in the spring statement. The Treasury is understood to have concerns about expanding nuclear power in the UK, with the cost of new plants due to be loaded on to people’s energy bills under the fresh funding system. The government would also be likely to take minority stakes in new projects, and has set aside an estimated £1.7bn on getting one plant, Sizewell C, in a position to go ahead. But with a renewed focus on weaning the UK off gas, Johnson is insistent on the need to press ahead with new plants, with a draft target of around 16GW of nuclear power in the medium term and closer to 30GW in the longer term. According to the government’s own impact assessment, it takes on average 13 to 17 years from initial investment to electricity being generated by a new nuclear plant. On onshore wind, allies of No 10 had described Johnson as “open-minded”, but “passionate about offshore”. He appears to have cooled on the prospect of more onshore wind, as well as the potential for fracking in England, because Tory MPs are resisting developments in their constituencies. The idea of giving communities discounts on their energy bills if they accept onshore developments in their areas has been mooted, meaning the prospect of new developments is “not impossible”, but still difficult, sources said. However, Johnson has been giving out mixed messages on onshore wind after telling a group of industry leaders this week that he was “horrified” how long the planning process takes. He was told that a wind turbine can be put up in a day, but planning permission can take a decade. Officials expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, to be announced in the Queen’s speech in May. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment in Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-22T14:16:40Z","webTitle":"‘It’s half of what was shot at us’: Kharkiv’s Russian missile cemetery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s half of what was shot at us’: Kharkiv’s Russian missile cemetery","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"During the first few months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the cruise missiles fired by Moscow at its neighbour remained embedded for days at a time in the buildings and streets of the north-eastern province Kharkiv. Then, one by one, officials working for Ukrainian prosecutors recovered, registered and catalogued them, before moving them to a fenced-off area in an industrial district of Kharkiv city that has become known as the “missile cemetery”. More than 1,000 explosives and the debris of rockets are lined up in rows, covering an area half the size of a football field. Ukraine’s army calculates that Russia has fired more than 5,000 cruise missiles, in addition to countless artillery rockets, since the war began. A large number have fallen on Kharkiv. Local authorities say that one day the devices could become part of a museum to remember the atrocities of war. In the meantime, though, they hope the debris can provide information to help bring prosecutions against Russian authorities and soldiers. “This place was created for collecting evidence of war crimes,” said Dmytro Chubenko, the spokesperson for the Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office. “These devices were all found in Kharkiv city. But it is approximately only half of what they shot at us. These are pieces of evidence that we hope will be used in the international criminal court.” About 95% of all the devices stored in the missile cemetery are parts of multiple launch rocket systems, including Smerch systems that can be used to carry cluster bombs, which were banned by most of the world under a 2008 treaty and have been used by Russia in areas of Ukraine where there were neither military personnel nor military infrastructure. By analysing the types of devices fired, their flight paths and the GPS locations of where they landed, prosecutors in Kharkiv have placed dozens of Russian soldiers and officials under investigation, including Col Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov, who also took part in Russia’s 2016 bombing campaign against Syria. According to multiple reports, Zhuravlyov was the only senior Russian officer who could sign off an order to launch a Smerch rocket attack on Kharkiv. Chubenko said the study and analysis of munitions was crucial to investigating responsibility for alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. Munitions are marked with a series of codes denoting the manufacturer, details of refurbishment if applicable, and more rarely the military unit that handled maintenance. “You can see the digits and letters which these missiles are marked with,” Chubenko said. “With the help of those we could identify which plant produced them and sometimes which military unit stored and maintained them.” Neil Corney is a research associate at the Omega Research Foundation, an independent organisation based in the UK dedicated to providing evidence-based information about the manufacture, trade and use of military, security and police technologies. He said identifying the unit that stored missiles and rockets was key to investigating potential war crimes. “Ideally, if you want to link the use of the munition to a crime then you need to show its chain of custody,” said Corney. This chain includes where the munition was stored and maintained, its distribution to a military unit, its use, its location at the site of a potential crime, and the secure storage of its remains. In the Kharkiv missile cemetery, prosecutors have stored some of the missiles that hit residential areas in north Saltivka and Oleksiyivka. They have singled out a Russian general, whose name cannot be disclosed due to an ongoing investigation, who allegedly gave an order to launch at least 100 missiles from Russian-occupied northern Ukraine into the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a hotbed of early nuclear research in the former Soviet Union. Although the facility does not present a radiation threat, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has said that the scale and intensity of attacks on the institute “violates all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars I outlined at the beginning of the conflict”. Chubenko said the consequences of the missile attacks could have been drastic. “Of course the Russians were aware of the nuclear research reactor being located there since it was built in the Soviet times and Rosatom [the Russian state nuclear power company] has got all the blueprints,” he added. Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief prosecutor for Kharkiv, said thousands of potential war crime and other criminal proceedings had been opened against Russian soldiers and officials in his province alone. Authorities estimate that more than 1,700 people have been killed by Russian shelling, including 44 children, in Kharkiv city and its surroundings. Nationwide, the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has recorded 21,965 civilian casualties since the beginning of the Russian invasion, including 8,231 deaths. The OHCHR has noted that the actual casualty figures are much higher due to a delay in receiving information from locations experiencing intense hostilities. Reports are still pending corroboration in places including Mariupol, Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: invasion ‘starting to fail’ and Russian forces suffering huge losses, says UK – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: invasion ‘starting to fail’ and Russian forces suffering huge losses, says UK – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of today’s headlines: The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. There have been conflicting reports of continued shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled ten times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. Energoatom said the plant was operating normally. However, Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have also claimed Thursday that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar. None of the claims have been independently verified. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident.” At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country. On Wednesday, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. That’s it from the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow but for now, it’s goodnight from me. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country. McDonald’s said on Thursday that it would begin gradually reopening some restaurants in western Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv, where other American businesses including Nike and KFC, and Spanish clothing retailer Mango are open. “We’ve spoken extensively to our employees who have expressed a strong desire to return to work and see our restaurants in Ukraine reopen,” Paul Pomroy, corporate senior vice-president of international markets, said in a message to staff. “In recent months, the belief that this would support a small but important sense of normalcy has grown stronger.” Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Late last month Ukraine announced the mandatory evacuation of people from Donetsk region, which has been the scene of fierce fighting with Russia, to save civilian lives, Reuters reported. Although the authorities describe the evacuation as “mandatory”, residents can opt out by filling in a form declaring their intention to stay. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres earlier on Thursday called for an immediate end to military activity near the facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Reuters reported. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident.” At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. Commenting on the incident, the Belarusian Defence Ministry said “the engine of a vehicle caught fire after replacement ... there were no casualties.” The incident occurred after powerful explosions rocked Russia’s Saki air base earlier this week in Russian-ruled Crimea, which Moscow had termed an accident. Ukraine has declined to publicly claim responsibility for the explosions at the base, while also not denying involvement. The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Denmark joined the UK in offering more aid to Ukraine at a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday, co-hosted by Wallace. The defence secretary said it was important to understand that fighting and loss of life was still taking place, but added Russia was “starting to fail in many areas”. He said: They have failed so far and are unlikely to ever succeed in occupying Ukraine. Their invasion has faltered and constantly been re-modified to the extent they are really only focusing in parts of the south and in the east, a long, long way away from their three-day so-called special operation. Three days are now over 150 days and nearly six months in, with huge significant losses of both equipment and indeed Russian personnel. He added: President Putin will have gambled that come August, come a few months in, we will have all got bored of the conflict and the international community would have gone off in different directions. Well, today is proof of the opposite. We have come out of this meeting with more pledges of finance, more pledges of training and more pledges of military aid, all designed to help Ukraine win, to help Ukraine stand up for its sovereignty and indeed to ensure that president Putin’s ambitions fail in Ukraine as they rightly should. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Here are some of the latest images sent over the newswires from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom has also claimed that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been attacked again, although, contrary to the claims reported in Russian media that Ukraine was to blame, it said that it has been shelled by pro-Russian forces. In a statement on Telegram it said: Today the Rashists once again bombarded the ZNPP, the largest in Ukraine and Europe. Five “arrivals” were recorded in the area of the commandant’s office of the station – right next to the welding area and the storage of radiation sources. Grass caught fire in a small area, but luckily no one was hurt. However, the enemy did not stop there. Five more “arrivals” occurred in the area of the fire department, which is located not far from the ZNPP … for the safety of nuclear workers, the buses with the personnel of the next shift were turned back to Energodar. Until the situation finally normalises, the workers of the previous shift will continue to work. The situation at the station is currently under control. The information, which was immediately spread in the hostile public, that the staff allegedly left the station in a panic, is fake and manipulative. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian news agency Tass is reporting that the occupying forces in Zaporizhzhia have told it that the armed forces of Ukraine fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory near the nuclear facility for the second time in a day. The claims have not been independently verified. The nuclear complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Sweden’s government has decided to extradite a man to Turkey wanted for fraud, it said, the first case since Turkey demanded a number of people be extradited in return for allowing Stockholm to formally apply for Nato membership. Turkey, a Nato member, lifted its veto over Finland and Sweden’s bid to join the alliance in June after weeks of tense negotiations where Ankara accused the two Nordic countries of harbouring what it says are militants of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). As part of the deal, Turkey submitted a list of people it wanted Sweden to extradite, but has since expressed frustration over the lack of progress. The man, in his 30s, would be the first known case of an extradition to Turkey since the deal was struck. “This is a normal, routine matter. The person in question is a Turkish citizen and convicted of fraud offences in Turkey in 2013 and 2016,” Morgan Johansson, Sweden’s justice minister, told Reuters in a text message. “The supreme court has examined the issue as usual and concluded that there are no obstacles to extradition,” he said. A spokesperson for the justice ministry declined to say whether the man was on the list of people Turkey demanded to have extradited, or to provide further comment on the matter. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference, Reuters reported. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, called for an immediate end to military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Europe’s largest. “I am calling on the military forces of the Russian Federation and Ukraine to immediately cease all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant and not to target its facilities or surroundings,” he said in a statement on Thursday. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told the UAE president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on a call that cooperation between the two countries on Ukraine and regional stability was “hugely important for the world”, Johnson’s spokesperson said. “The prime minister praised the crown prince’s success in bringing prosperity to both the UAE and the Gulf more generally,” the Downing Street spokesperson said on Thursday. “[Johnson] expressed his confidence that this cooperation will continue in the years ahead.” Britain and Denmark will provide more financial and military aid to Ukraine, they said on Thursday as European defence ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss long-term support for the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion. Britain, which has already donated advanced weapons systems to Ukraine and given thousands of its troops military training, said it would send more multiple-launch rocket systems, Reuters reported. It would also donate a “significant number” of precision-guided M31A1 missiles that can strike targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. “This latest tranche of military support will enable the armed forces of Ukraine to continue to defend against Russian aggression and the indiscriminate use of long-range artillery,” the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said in a statement. “Our continued support sends a very clear message: Britain and the international community remain opposed to this illegal war and will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin’s invasion.” Denmark will increase its financial aid to Ukraine by 110m euros, said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, at a conference in Copenhagen hosted by Ukraine, Denmark and Britain. She added: “This is a war on the values that Europe and the free world are built upon ... Today we reaffirm our commitment to support of Ukraine.” Russia has turned down a Swiss offer to represent Ukrainian interests in Russia and Moscow’s interests in Ukraine because it no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country. Switzerland has a long diplomatic tradition of acting as an intermediary between countries whose relations have broken down, but Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Ivan Nechayev said this was not possible in the current situation. “The Swiss were indeed interested in our opinion on the possible representation of Ukraine’s interests in Russia and Russia’s in Ukraine,” Nechayev told reporters. “We very clearly answered that Switzerland had unfortunately lost its status of a neutral state and could not act either as an intermediary or a representative. Bern has joined illegal western sanctions against Russia.” Neutral Switzerland has mirrored nearly all the sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine, Reuters reported. Ukraine has accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have claimed that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one person, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the Ukrainian military had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire, Reuters reported. Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, said that two settlements that border Ukraine were shelled. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, it said Russia had chosen a “cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places” in Ukraine. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Tom Ambrose will be here with you shortly. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has been at the Ukraine Donors’ Conference in Copenhagen with his Danish and British counterparts. Speaking this morning, he said: Russia’s words, and agreements with them, are not worth the paper they are written on. So what can be done? This solution is obvious. Russia succeeds when it manages to divide us, when it confronts us one-on-one, pulling together its resources and beating us. Russia is defeated and backs down when it loses the initiative, and meets with coordinated resistance. He went on to thank the Danish defence minister, Morten Bøedsko, and the British defence minister, Ben Wallace, for their continued support, and also singled out for praise Lloyd Austin, the US secretary of defence. The meeting was addressed via video link by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here is a selection of some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, the Saeima called on the EU to prevent tourism from Russia. It said: Russia has been providing support and financing for terrorist regimes and organisations for many years, directly and indirectly, as the largest arms supplier for the Assad regime in Syria and as an implementer, such as the poisoning of the Skripal family or the shooting of the MH-17 aircraft. In Ukraine, Russia has chosen a similar, cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places. Latvia’s public broadcaster reports: In its statement, the Saeima stresses that Russia uses suffering and intimidation as an instrument in its attempts to demoralise the Ukrainian people and armed forces. The Saeima acknowledges Russia’s violence against civilians, which is being pursued for political purposes, as terrorism and Russia as a country supporting terrorism, and calls on other similar-thinking countries to express such an opinion. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. Reuters reports that the Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have claimed to Russian news agencies Tass and RIA that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. The source of attacks on and near to the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant has been hotly disputed. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has been exploiting the explosions at the Russian air base in Crimea for social media propaganda purposes. It has issued a video with the message: “Unless they want an unpleasantly hot summer break, we advise our valued Russian guests not to visit Ukrainian Crimea. Because no amount of sunscreen will protect them from the hazardous effects of smoking in unauthorised areas.” The video, to the soundtrack of Bananarama’s Cruel Summer, lists a host of summer holiday venues that Russian tourists in Crimea could have chosen instead, alongside inviting footage of those destinations, then says that they made a big mistake by choosing to holiday in Ukraine. It then cuts together social media footage of the explosions along with clips of tourists fleeing beaches and crying in the aftermath of the incident. The reference to “smoking in unauthorised areas” is to the suggestion from Russian authorities that the explosions, which appear to have destroyed multiple planes that were on the ground at the time, were caused by an accidental fire at the base. Back to that series of explosions at a Russian air base on Tuesday for a moment, the Guardian has been carrying some analysis by Justin Bronk: Justin Bronk, an aviation analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said that, having studied social media videos of the incident, he could see no evidence of incoming missiles and that he was “almost certain” there were “secondary explosions” of ammunition stores or fuel bunkers which were stored on or near the airstrip. That led him to conclude that “the most likely current theory for me is that Ukrainian special forces carried out the attack by infiltrating close enough to the base to launch and guide in small UAVs [drones] or loitering munitions, to hit either parked aircraft or fuel trucks/storage”. Read more here in our updated report from Samantha Lock and from Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv: Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea airbase attack, satellite images show Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, has claimed on Telegram that two Russian settlements close to the border with Ukraine are under fire this morning. He named Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi as the targets. His message promised more details later. Russian media this morning are carrying claims from the self-proclaimed breakaway republics in Ukraine’s east. Tass has quotes from Denis Pushilin, the self-styled leader of the chiefly unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Pushilin again is pushing his line that the deaths of prisoners of war at the Russian-controlled Olenivka prison were the responsibility of Kyiv. He told the media: The motive here is clear. The first is to shut up, not to give them the opportunity to speak, to confess to those crimes. Because not only are they the perpetrators of war crimes, they are also witnesses. Because these teams gave them specific names, surnames, positions and directly, according to our data, Zelensky himself often personally intervened here. Tass goes on to quote him saying that the attack happened after confessions of Ukrainian soldiers began to be made public. “After these video confessions began to appear, this blow was dealt directly,” he said. There have been calls for a UN-backed independent investigation into the incident, which led to the deaths of at least 51 people died while more than 100 were injured. Both sides of the war have claimed the other is responsible. Ukraine claims pro-Russian forces blew up the prison building to conceal evidence of the torture and deaths of the POWs being held there. The RIA Novosti agency, meanwhile, is carrying a claim from the authorities of the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). In its report it says that the armed forces of the LPR have told it that they have found the bodies of foreign mercenaries that have been burnt by Ukrainian troops as they retreated in order to conceal the identity of the dead. The incident is reported to have happened at Soledar, which is inside the territory claimed by the DPR. The report offered no evidence and the claims have not been independently verified. The DPR and the LPR are only recognised as legitimate authorities by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. The British ministry of defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing about the war in Ukraine, which today has focused on the impact of the war on Russia’s military exports. In part of the report, the ministry says Russia’s “military industrial capacity is now under significant strain, and the credibility of many of its weapon systems has been undermined by their association with Russian forces’ poor performance in the Ukraine war.” Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to say that his western region of Ukraine had a peaceful night with no attacks or air alarms. He said that 155 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east yesterday. This is Martin Belam on the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand you over to my colleague, Martin Belam, here is a quick update of developments so far this morning. Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The images, from the US-based Planet Labs, show large areas of scorched earth and damage to the runway alongside the charred remnants of military aircraft. Russia has claimed control of Pisky in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. An official with the Russia-backed Donetsk People’s Republic said Pisky, on the frontlines just 10km (6 miles) northwest of provincial capital Donetsk, was under control of Russian and separatist forces. “It’s hot in Pisky. The town is ours,” the official, Danil Bezsonov, said on Telegram. Ukrainian officials denied that the heavily fortified town, a key to the defence of Donetsk, had fallen. Reports of explosions sounding near the Belarus border with Ukraine were described on Wednesday evening. Franak Viacorka, senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the national leader of Belarus and opposition leader to president Alexander Lukashenko, said he heard “at least eight explosions” around 1am in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a Donetsk brewery, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia. The emergencies ministry in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said a shell had hit an ammonia line late at night, sparking a fire that at one point covered 600 square metres (6,500 square feet). The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The meeting is scheduled to occur on 11 August at 3pm (7pm GMT) according to a statement issued by the UN nuclear safety watchdog. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine under a UN-backed deal last week docked in Turkey on Wednesday, marine traffic sites showed, following a report that it has finally found a buyer for its maize. Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey’s Mediterranean Sea port of Mersin after spending several days anchored just off the coast. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after an agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The first 12 ships to leave the three Black Sea ports designated by the agreement were carrying 370,000 tonnes of corn and foodstuffs, according to Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator at the joint centre in Istanbul overseeing the deal. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, Kenney said. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Heavy fighting raged around the eastern Ukrainian town of Pisky on Thursday as Russia pressed its campaign to seize all of the industrialised Donbas region. An official with the Russia-backed Donetsk People’s Republic said Pisky, on the frontlines just 10km (6 miles) northwest of provincial capital Donetsk, was under control of Russian and separatist forces. “It’s hot in Pisky. The town is ours but there remain scattered pockets of resistance in its north and west,” the official, Danil Bezsonov, said on Telegram, according to a report from Reuters news agency. Ukrainian officials denied that the heavily fortified town, a key to the defence of Donetsk, had fallen. The Guardian has been unable to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said in an interview posted on YouTube that Russian “movement into Pisky” had been “without success”. Luhansk regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai, interviewed on Ukrainian TV, said Russia had sent increasing numbers of mercenaries into the region, including from the Wagner private security firm. “We once had peaceful Ukrainian towns. Now we have been thrust into the Middle Ages ... People are now leaving because they are afraid of freezing in the coming winter,” he said. Reports of explosions sounding near the Belarus border with Ukraine were described on Wednesday evening. Franak Viacorka, senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the national leader of Belarus and opposition leader to president Alexander Lukashenko, said he heard “at least eight explosions” around 1am in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. “At least eight explosions in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. According to witnesses, explosions took place near Ziabrauka airfield. Russian military aircraft are often stationed there,” he said in a tweet. According to the Belarus defence ministry, military drills were set to be conducted during the time the explosions were heard. However, there has been no confirmation whether the explosions were connected to the drills. The Ziabrauka airfield has been used by Russia’s armed forces in the war against Ukraine. The armed forces of Ukraine also said it had received information that explosions could be heard and flares can be seen in the vicinity of the Ziabrauka airfield in an update posted to Telegram late on Wednesday. Earlier, the Belarus ministry of defence announced the conduct of live-fire exercises of the air force. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia, Interfax news agency said. The emergencies ministry in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said a shell had hit an ammonia line late at night, sparking a fire that at one point covered 600 square metres (6,500 square feet). Reuters pictures from the scene showed flames lighting the sky above one part of the city as well as firefighters donning masks. One picture appeared to show a corpse on the ground. Russian state media agency RT said the “toxic gas is affecting a 2km radius round the factory” citing local DPR officials. Residents have been urged to stay inside and not open their windows. The Ukrainian defence ministry has not made any comment. On the topic of Ukrainian grain exports, the centre coordinating its shipment to world markets expects “a big uptick” in applications to pick up cargoes at Ukrainian ports in the near future, its interim coordinator said. Frederick Kenney told a virtual news conference from Istanbul, where the Joint Coordination Centre is located, that ship owners have shown “tremendous interest” in exporting grain from Ukraine under a recently signed new deal. The centre is receiving “literally dozens and dozens of phone calls every day and emails asking when can we get ready to go,” said Kenney, director of legal and external affairs at the international maritime organisation who is leading the UN’s efforts at the centre to get grain shipped from three Ukrainian ports. He said detailed procedures on shipping and inspections were sent out to the industry on Monday and their dissemination “is also going to drive a surge in requests, but it is early days.” We’re expecting to see a big uptick in applications for transit,” Kenney said. “Indeed, we’re aware that there are a number of empty grain vessels sitting at anchorage in Turkish anchorage areas waiting to arrange the contracts. And once they have their deals arranged they’ll be transiting northbound.” Asked about relations among the parties, since Russia and Ukraine are at war, he said, “I’ve been extremely impressed with the level of cooperation and coordination that has been displayed.” The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, diplomatic sources told Agence France-Presse. The meeting is scheduled to occur on 11 August at 3pm (7pm GMT) according to a statement issued by the UN nuclear safety watchdog. A diplomatic source at UN headquarters in New York told Agence France-Presse that the council’s 15 member nations would gather at the request of Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council - along with Britain, China, France and the United States - which hold veto power over UN resolutions. At least 14 people were killed after shelling in southeastern Ukraine near the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe. The G7 group of most industrialised nations warned that Moscow’s continued occupation of the plant “endangers the region,” and called for return of the facility to Ukrainian control. The UN nuclear safety watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement that its director general Rafael Grossi would brief the Security Council meeting “about the nuclear safety and security situation” at the plant as well as his “efforts to agree and lead an IAEA expert mission to the site as soon as possible”. “I welcome this opportunity to inform the Council. It is vital that the IAEA be present at the plant to help reduce danger of a possible nuclear disaster,” Grossi said. I welcome this opportunity to inform the United Nations Security Council about the extremely serious situation facing one of the world’s biggest nuclear power plants, now located in the middle of an active war zone. An accident at this plant could threaten public health and the environment both in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, as well as further away. It is vital that the IAEA be present at the plant to help reduce danger of a possible nuclear disaster.” Grossi called the situation at the complex “extremely serious”. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine under a UN-backed deal last week docked in Turkey on Wednesday, marine traffic sites showed, following a report that it has finally found a buyer for its maize. The Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni left the Ukrainian port of Odesa on 1 August carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli last weekend. But Ukrainian officials said the shipment’s five-month delay caused by Russia’s invasion prompted the Lebanese buyer to cancel the deal once the ship was already at sea. Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey’s Mediterranean Sea port of Mersin after spending several days anchored just off the coast. The Middle East Eye news site cites a shipping agent as saying that a Turkish buyer has been found for the maize. The “cargo sold.... It will [unload] at Mersin,” Ahmed al-Fares of the Ashram Maritime Agency told the news site. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The first 12 ships to leave the three Black Sea ports designated by the agreement were carrying 370,000 tonnes of corn and foodstuffs, according to Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator at the joint centre in Istanbul overseeing the deal. But that should change once the ships docked in Ukraine leave their ports and new ones come in to pick up wheat that has accumulated with this year’s harvest, Kenney told reporters. We are dealing with three ports that were essentially frozen in time. The silos were full of corn and the ships that were there have been loaded with corn. It’s imperative to get those ships out to get new ships in .... that can deal with the food crisis.” Kenney added that the shipments would be transitioning to wheat. We have cleared the first ship inbound” to Ukraine through the Bosphorus Strait, he said. “That should occur some time next week.” We’re seeing steady progress in the number of ships coming in and out. We’re off to a good start.” At least eight Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The images, from the US-based Planet Labs, show large areas of scorched earth and damage to the runway alongside the charred remnants of military aircraft. Images taken by the private satellite operator at around 8am on 9 August – approximately four hours before the attack – and about 4.40pm on 10 August, show at least eight aircraft parked outside were damaged or destroyed. The before-and-after images are the first independent confirmation of damage to the base, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Eliot Higgins, founder and director of open source investigative website Bellingcat, said he “can’t think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory” in a series of tweets on Thursday. Ukraine says nine Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He said: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” The country’s air force also said on its Facebook page that “nine invader planes” had been destroyed in a short posting, although it did not specify in that message where or how it believed they had been eliminated. Ukraine’s president, Volodoymyr Zelenskiy, referred to the attack in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” The claims could not be verified but the Saky airbase is home to Su-30M fighters, Su-24 bombers and the Il-76 transporter, used regularly to launch missile strikes into Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea and surrounding area. Ukraine’s public coyness about the attack is partly designed to preserve some ambiguity about the means used, sources said, prompting broad speculation as to how Kyiv was able to strike so deep behind Russian lines, in one of the first attacks on Crimean soil since the Russian invasion began in February. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins. At least eight Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, diplomatic sources told Agence France-Presse. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansion of the Nato defence alliance. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator in Istanbul. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Estonia said it had summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry announced, saying the helicopter had flown over Estonia’s south-east without permission. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20bn in international bonds, allowing it to avoid a debt default, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s prime minister says it will save the country almost $6bn, while helping to stabilise its economy and strengthen its army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T11:18:14Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt ‘lining up new 40% windfall tax on electricity generators’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt ‘lining up new 40% windfall tax on electricity generators’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt is reportedly preparing to hit electricity generation companies with a 40% windfall tax on their “excess returns” as he attempts to fund measures to ease the cost of living crisis. The chancellor is considering a levy on the extra profits made by generators above a certain price per megawatt hour, which has yet to be decided. Hunt is also planning to toughen the existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators, raising the tax from 25% to 35% and extending it by two years until 2028. The two windfall taxes are expected to generate £45bn over six years depending on movements in energy prices, according to the Financial Times. The North Sea windfall tax had been forecast to raise around £28bn over four years. The move to curb the profits on electricity generators represents a departure from the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to cap the revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, in line with the EU’s “revenue cap”. Officials have spent more than six months examining methods of taxing electricity generators, which have enjoyed big profits on the back of soaring power prices – linked to the rising wholesale cost of natural gas – while their costs remained largely stable. The government has worked on plans to shift companies on a voluntary basis to contracts for difference, which cap their revenues but guarantee them a long-term income. However, the generation industry has been split on which scheme they favour. Industry sources said generators have increasingly indicated that a one-off windfall tax would be preferable to the uncertainty of options linked to volatile energy prices. “The suggestion has been that the options are simply too complex, and a straightforward windfall tax would give more certainty over the future for investors,” said one energy executive. There are fears that a tax on renewable companies could deter investors from backing large-scale green energy projects. The energy generator SSE has said a windfall tax could damage Britain’s progress on building up domestic sources of electricity. Hunt is expected to present the toughened windfall tax in his autumn statement on Thursday. He is also likely to announce changes to the energy price guarantee, which caps a typical household bill at £2,500. In one of his first acts as chancellor, Hunt shortened Truss’s two-year policy to cut energy bills to six months. He is expected to keep protection in place for millions of vulnerable low-income households and pensioners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-17T15:41:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine urges world leaders to intensify war efforts on first day at Davos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine urges world leaders to intensify war efforts on first day at Davos","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has urged world leaders to intensify efforts to remove Vladimir Putin’s troops from its soil as the country’s war with Russia dominated the first full day of the gathering of the global elite in Davos. With the war clouding the outlook for the global economy in 2023, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, urged the country’s allies to step up supplies of military hardware so that Russia could be more quickly defeated. Asked what was next for Ukraine, Svyrydenko said: “What’s next is success. Russia won’t achieve its goal and we will definitely win this war.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, used a special address to demand that those attending the World Economic Forum use their influence to end Russia’s aggression. Zelenska told delegates in Davos that some were failing to use their influence, or sometimes using it in a way “that divides even more”. “What can life be in a world where tanks are allowed to strike at nuclear power stations? What will happen to inflation when state borders start to collapse, and the integrity of countries is trampled?” she asked. “This war can go further, and make crises wider, if the aggressor does not lose,” Zelenska added. She brought three letters from her husband, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to hand to Alain Berset, the president of the Swiss Confederation, to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and for China’s Xi Jinping, which has been handed to the vice-premier, Liu He, who is attending Davos. The note says that “if people come together, they can move mountains”, Zelenska revealed. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy crisis on an unprecedented scale. “Our world has never ever seen an energy crisis of this depth and of this complexity,” he said. “At the same time it gave a big boost to clean energy development. In the past clean energy was renewables, electric cars, efficiency, heat pumps, they were growing, but the main driver was environmental reasons. The biggest driver [of renewables] today is energy security – homegrown is the energy of peace.” Beata Javorcik, the chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), said the focus had changed since the last Davos meeting in May. “In May, we were talking about reconstruction [of Ukraine]. The focus now is getting through the winter, what’s happening in the here and now”. Javorcik said international bodies such as the EBRD were concentrating on emergency budget support and emergency repairs. “We are helping to keep the lights on, the heat on and the trains running”, she said. At least 7 million Ukrainians have fled abroad since the war started last February and Javorcik said the EBRD was eager to avoid another wave of refugees by providing help over the coming months. “Human capital is as important as physical capital,” she said. Von der Leyen said the EU would not desert Ukraine. “We are in it for as long as it takes, and stand by our Ukrainian friends”, she said. North Macedonia’s president, Stevo Pendarovski, said he feared that the western Balkans were a soft spot in Europe’s security architecture. Pendarovski told a Davos event that Putin’s regime had, for years, tried to provoke the people in the region, through fake news and propaganda. He predicted that Russia could try to deflect the west’s attention from Ukraine, and that the western Balkan region was more prone to that risk than the Baltic countries. “It seems to me that the so-called soft spot in the whole pan-European security architecture right now, apart from Ukraine of course, from that danger from the Kremlin is the western Balkans,” Pendarovski said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","fields":{"headline":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government’s latest budget will do little to meet the UK’s net zero carbon goals, missed opportunities to create a green economy, and would saddle households with high energy bills driven by fossil fuel prices, green campaigners and experts have said. Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T10:07:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 167 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 167 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. In an interview the self-appointed leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine has said “Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence.” Two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. Four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold live fire military training exercises both in Belarus and in Russia during August. Russia launched an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday on morning, but Tehran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its latest invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic Security Service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The United States will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to Ukraine’s government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry called the PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines – also known as “butterfly mines” – “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons” with the potential to inflict widespread casualties among both the military and the local civilian population. The first grain carrying ship to depart Ukrainian ports after the UN-brokered deal is looking for another port to unload its cargo after the initial Lebanese buyer refused delivery due to its five-month delay, Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom has called for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, warning of the risk of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster after shelling of the site caused a reactor to shut down on Saturday. Russia and Ukraine continue to trade accusations over is responsible for the shelling, with the UN calling for international inspectors to be given access. According to reports from the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the nuclear power station is currently operating normally. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/11/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-citizen-detained-in-moscow-ukraine-counteroffensive-reported-in-four-areas","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-11T18:37:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukraine says flood evacuees killed by Russian attack – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/11/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-citizen-detained-in-moscow-ukraine-counteroffensive-reported-in-four-areas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/11/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-citizen-detained-in-moscow-ukraine-counteroffensive-reported-in-four-areas","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukraine says flood evacuees killed by Russian attack – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thank you for following developments today, we will now be closing this blog.

Two villages were officially reported liberated earlier on Sunday, Blahodatne, and Neskutchne. They were the first settlements officially confirmed liberated since the start of the counteroffensive a week ago. This evening, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said a third village had fallen to the advancing Ukrainian forces, Makarivka, a couple of kilometres to the south. “In the areas where our troops are on the defensive, no position was lost,” Maliar added on the Telegram messaging app. Makarivka is believed to have been taken on Sunday morning. “By the way, we didn’t move our main forces yet,” a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. “So there are grounds to believe in the best.” The advance south from Velyka Novosilka represents the most significant gains of the counteroffensive to date, but the Ukrainian forces still have some way to go before they even reach the Russian’s main fortified defensive line. My colleague Julian Borger is in Kyiv and is reporting on Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Ukraine’s armed forces have claimed to have liberated two frontline villages in western Donetsk, he writes, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit’s banner in Neskuchne. You can read his full report here The time in Kyiv is coming up to 8.30pm. Here’s a roundup of today’s news about Russia’s war in Ukraine. Three civilians have been killed and ten others people wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reports. Two of the ten people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia and Ukraine have simultaneously swapped nearly 100 prisoners each. The Ukrainian prisoners included members of the national guard and border guards who had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along Turkstream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, the ministry said. The Kremlin has also said there was no foundation for talks with Ukraine. ‘There is practically no precondition for an agreement at the moment. Moreover, there is no foundation, even flimsy, for any kind of dialogue’, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Rossiya state television. In other key developments: Russian air defence systems have shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, the TASS news agency reported. Ukrainian troops said they had recaptured a village from Russian forces in the south-east, the first liberated settlement they have claimed since launching a counterattack this week. The settlement was identified as Blahodatne in Donetsk region in an unverified video. “We’re seeing the first results of the counter-offensive actions, localised results,” Valeryi Shershen, spokesperson for Ukraine’s “Tavria” military sector, said on television. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the breach of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday led to major flooding. Russian forces also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said. Russia’s most powerful mercenary said on Sunday that his Wagner fighters would not sign any contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its sway. In response to a request for comment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner group, said: “Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,,” adding that the minister “cannot properly manage military formations.” Wagner was integrated into the overall system and completely subordinate to the interests of Russia, he said, but its command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. Kyiv’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from launching an offensive and advancing in the southern Kherson region. She said the action was also intended to help Russia deploy reserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia’s defence minister awarded medals to soldiers on Sunday after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia’s highest military honour, to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. Two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia’s Kaluga region – one near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district, according to the governor of the region, Vladislav Shapsha. There were no casualties and only minimal damage, Shapsha said on Telegram. A US musician was arrested in Moscow accused of selling mephedrone. Russian news media reported on Saturday that a US musician, Michael Travis Leake, who has lived in Russia for more than a decade had been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. That’s it from me, Donna Ferguson, and the Ukraine Live blog. Thanks for following along. If you want to read more news about Ukraine, you can do so here. The Ukrainian prisoners that Russia has just released included members of the national guard and border guards, Reuters reports. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said those released had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. More details have emerged about the Russian attack on a boat carrying flood evacuees. “Three civilians died, ten more were wounded, including two law enforcement officers,” the governor of Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. In a statement on Telegram, he said a 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back and died. Russia and Ukraine have both simultaneously announced the return of nearly 100 soldiers from each side. The TASS news agency quoted Russia’s defence ministry as saying that 94 Russians in Ukrainian captivity had been released and would be taken to a medical institution to be examined. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said that 95 Ukrainian service members had been returned, including some wounded, according to Reuters. Three people were killed and 10 wounded when Russian forces shelled a boat carrying evacuees from flooded occupied territory to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson, Reuters has just reported. It isn’t clear whether this is the same boat in which six civilians were wounded that I referred to in my previous post. Six civilians were wounded on Sunday when Russian forces opened fire on a boat being used to evacuate civilians, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff has said. The civilians were fleeing from flooded, occupied territory to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson, Reuters reported. The area they were in experienced severe flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, which both Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of deliberately blowing up. “The Russian army attacked a boat with civilians evacuating from the left bank of Kherson region,” Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram. “They opened fire at the backs of civilians. Six people were wounded. They arrived in Kherson and were taken to hospital … Doctors are fighting for the lives of the wounded,” he wrote. Russian air defence systems have shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, the TASS news agency has reported. Ukrainian troops said on Sunday they had recaptured a village from Russian forces in the south-east, the first liberated settlement they have claimed since launching a counterattack this week. Soldiers hoisted the Ukrainian flag at a bombed-out building in an unverified video published by Ukraine’s 68th Jaeger Brigade, which identified the settlement as Blahodatne in Donetsk region, Reuters reported. “We’re seeing the first results of the counter-offensive actions, localised results,” Valeryi Shershen, spokesperson for Ukraine’s “Tavria” military sector, said on television. He said the village lay on the edge of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzia regions a few kilometres south of the Kyiv-controlled village of Velyka Novosilka. Ukrainian soldiers stand in front of a building with a Ukrainian flag on it in a location given as Blahodatne, Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the breach of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday led to major flooding. Russian forces also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the reports. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of Russia’s Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along Turkstream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, the ministry said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that counteroffensive and defensive operations were taking place in Ukraine, but would not say what stage they were at. “It’s interesting what Putin said about our counteroffensive. It is important that Russia always feels this: that they do not have long left, in my opinion,” the Ukrainian president added. Zelenskiy’s comments came after Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive was already failing. Russia’s most powerful mercenary said on Sunday that his Wagner fighters would not sign any contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its sway. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner group, has repeatedly attacked Vladimir Putin’s militaryleaders for what he casts as treachery for failing to fight the war in Ukraine properly. Neither Shoigu nor the chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov have commented in public on Prigozhin’s insults and criticism, Reuters reported. But the defence ministry said on Saturday that Shoigu had ordered all volunteer detachments to sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month, a step the ministry said would increase the effectiveness of the Russian army. The ministry did not mention Wagner in its statement, but Russian media reported that it was an attempt by Shoigu to bring the mercenaries to heel. “Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,” Prigozhin said in response to a request for comment. He said Wagner was integrated into the overall system and completely subordinate to the interests of Russia, but that its highly efficient command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. “Shoigu cannot properly manage military formations,” he said, adding that Wagner coordinated its actions in Ukraine with general Sergei Surovikin, nicknamed “General Armageddon” by the Russian media. Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing in the southern Kherson region, Kyiv’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Sunday. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam from inside its associated hydroelectric power station. The site has been under Russian occupation since the early weeks of the invasion in February last year. Moscow has blamed the destruction of the dam on Ukraine. Each side has accused the other of shelling civilians as rescue efforts are carried out, Reuters reported. “The explosion of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station was apparently carried out with the intention of preventing the Ukrainian defence forces from launching an offensive in the Kherson sector,” Maliar said on Telegram. She said the action, which unleashed a vast flood which inundated towns and villages, trapping residents and sweeping away homes, was also intended to help Russia deployreserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia’s defence minister awarded medals to soldiers on Sunday after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia’s highest military honour, to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. The soldiers did not identify the tanks in public. The defence ministry has published several videos and pictures in recent days showing strikes on Ukrainian-staffed armoured vehicles and tanks from Ka-52 attack helicopters and drones. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield claims from either side. The Kremlin has said there is no foundation for talks with Ukraine. ‘There is practically no precondition for an agreement at the moment. Moreover, there is no foundation, even flimsy, for any kind of dialogue’, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Rossiya state television. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam was a fast-moving disaster that is swiftly evolving into a long-term environmental catastrophe affecting drinking water, food supplies and ecosystems reaching into the Black Sea. The short-term dangers can be seen from outer space — tens of thousands of parcels of land flooded, and more to come. Experts say the long-term consequences will be generational. The Associated Press reported: For every flooded home and farm, there are fields upon fields of newly planted grains, fruits and vegetables whose irrigation canals are drying up. Thousands of fish were left gasping on mud flats. Fledgling water birds lost their nests and their food sources. Countless trees and plants were drowned. If water is life, then the draining of the Kakhovka reservoir creates an uncertain future for the region of southern Ukraine that was an arid plain until the damming of the Dnipro River 70 years ago. The Kakhovka Dam was the last in a system of six Soviet-era dams on the river, which flows from Belarus to the Black Sea. Then the Dnipro became part of the frontline after Russia’s invasion last year. “All this territory formed its own particular ecosystem, with the reservoir included,” said Kateryna Filiuta, an expert in protected habitats for the Ukraine Nature Conservation Group. Houses and a sports stadium are seen underwater and polluted by oil in Kherson, Ukraine, yesterday. More now from that ISW daily update. Russian sources are claiming that Ukraine has tactical advantages in conducting assaults at night due to Western-provided equipment with advanced night optics systems. A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are launching assaults at night because western-provided equipment provides Ukrainian forces with “excellent” night vision optics. Russian sources have widely claimed that Ukrainian forces have started or intensified assaults at night in recent days, and Ukrainian forces may be increasingly leveraging the advantages provided by western systems. Reuters reports that two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia’s Kaluga region, the governor of the region, Vladislav Shapsha, said on the Telegram messaging app. One drone crashed near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district. The Kaluga region borders the Moscow region to the north. According to preliminary information, there were no casualties and only minimal damage, Shapsha said on Telegram. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Earlier in the day inside Russia, 15 cars of an empty freight train derailed in the southern Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, the local governor said late on Saturday, adding there was no immediate information about the cause. The accident happened near a train station in the Alexeyevsky municipal district and the train was empty, Gladkov said. Reuters could not independently verify this report. Russian news media reported Saturday that an American musician who has lived in Russia for more than a decade has been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. The reports said Michael Travis Leake is suspected of selling mephedrone, whose effects are similar to those of cocaine and MDMA. A Moscow court ordered him to be held for two months in pre-trial detention, the reports said. He faces charges of production or distribution of drugs, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. An Instagram page under the name Travis Leake Instagram identifies him as the singer for the band Lovi Noch, meaning Seize the Night. News reports said Leake is a former paratrooper with the US military and has lived in Moscow since 2010. Russian drug laws are strict. WNBA star Brittney Griner was arrested in February 2022 after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage at a Moscow airport. She was sentenced to nine years in prison, but was released in December in an exchange for US-imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The US state department said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that it was aware of the reports that a US citizen had recently been arrested in Moscow. It said when a US citizen is detained overseas, the department “pursues consular access as soon as possible and works to provide all appropriate consular assistance”. The department said it would have no further comment due to privacy considerations. Ukrainian forces are conducting counteroffensive operations in at least four areas of the front, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War had said in its daily update. Ukrainian eastern group of forces spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty noted that Ukrainian forces advanced up to 1,400m in unspecified areas of the Bakhmut front, and Russian milbloggers reported Ukrainian advances northwest and northeast of Bakhmut, ISW says. Russian sources reported Ukrainian activity in Luhansk Oblast near Bilohorivka, while the Russian defence ministry and other Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops conducted localised attacks in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, particularly in the Velyka Novosilka area. ISW reports geolocated footage posted on 10 June additionally indicates that Ukrainian forces in western Zaporizhia Oblast made gains during counterattacks southwest and southeast of Orikhiv. It says Ukrainian forces are unsurprisingly taking casualties in initial attacks against some of the best-prepared Russian forces in Ukraine. However, initial attacks – and particularly selected footage that Russian sources are intentionally disseminating and highlighting – are not representative of all Ukrainian operations. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine, I’m Christine Kearney bringing you the latest. Russian news media are reporting that an American musician who has lived in Russia for more than a decade has been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. The reports said Michael Travis Leake is suspected of selling mephedrone. A Moscow court ordered him to be held for two months in pre-trial detention, the reports said. An Instagram page under the name Travis Leake Instagram page identifies him as the singer for the band Lovi Noch, which means Seize the Night. Meanwhile US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War had said in its daily update that Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations in at least four areas of the front. More details shortly, in other key developments: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that counteroffensive and defensive operations were taking place in Ukraine, a day after Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin said Kyiv’s long-vaunted drive to retake territory was well under way. Zelenskiy would not say what stage they were at, but to pass on to Putin that his generals were optimistic and in ‘positive mood’. Counterattacking Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 1,400 metres at a number of sections of the front line near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the past day, a Ukraine military spokesperson said on Saturday. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said over the past 48 hours “significant” Ukrainian operations have taken place in several sectors of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have “likely made good progress” and “penetrated the first line of Russian defences”, the MoD added. However, in other areas “Ukrainian progress has been slower”. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine’s forces have continued “unsuccessful” attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. A drone attack by Russian forces killed three people and injured 27 people, including three children, in Ukraine’s Odesa region in the early hours of Saturday, according to Ukraine’s southern command. Emergency services said but the fire had been rapidly put out and 12 people were rescued from the building. The UN’s top aid official Martin Griffiths has warned Ukraine’s humanitarian situation is “hugely worse” after the Kakhova dam rupture. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Saturday that he planned to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone soon to urge him to withdraw troops from Ukraine. Canada’s minister, Justin Trudeau, landed in Kyiv on Saturday and said Canada will be part of a multinational effort to train Ukrainian fighter pilots. He also announced C$500m ($375m) worth of military aid for Kyiv and said the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was a “direct consequence of Russia’s war”. Russian activists and dissidents say Russian authorities in Kherson region are preventing 1,842 left bank residents, including 338 urgent cases around Olekshy, and nearby, from leaving. The figure includes 148 children and 243 elderly people, said the Anti-War Human Rights Coalition. Russia has fired missiles and attack drones at the central Ukrainian region of Poltava overnight, inflicting “some damage of infrastructure and equipment” at the Myrhorod military airfield, according to the regional governor. A £150m fund to help Ukrainians into their own homes has been announced by the UK government. More than 124,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The UK will also provide an extra £16m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iceland’s decision to suspend its embassy operations in Moscow “destroys” bilateral cooperation adding the action would elicit a “corresponding” response. The southern reach of the Dnipro River is likely to return to its banks by 16 June after the breach of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam this week, a Russian-installed official said on Saturday. Vladimir Saldo said the water level at Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had now dropped three metres (10ft) from Tuesday’s peak, Reuters reported. German investigators are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to damage the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September, the Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency says it has put the last operating reactor at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant into a “cold shutdown” as a safety precaution amid flooding from the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about an upcoming mission to broker peace by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine to try and broker peace, Pretoria said on Saturday. The UN has helped boost Russian exports of food and fertilisers, facilitating a steady flow of ships to its ports ahead of an important grain deal deadline. Top UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as Moscow threatens to walk away from a deal allowing the safe export of food and fertiliser from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports on 17 July if obstacles to its own shipments are not removed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs have warned consumers may end up paying higher bills if the government rushes into providing further state support for power station owner Drax. As part of Liz Truss’s £150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators are being asked to supply electricity below current market rates. Officials have begun to “negotiate” with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. It is understood Drax, which owns the vast power station complex in North Yorkshire and is Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, could also negotiate over units 2 and 3 at its plant, which receive renewable obligation certificate (ROC) payments for burning biomass wood pellets, making them eligible for the scheme. Generators are not obliged to negotiate with the government as the scheme is voluntary. Drax has not yet confirmed whether it plans to rework its contract. It said it is “working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter”. However, there are growing fears that the government is in a weak negotiating position as generators will need to be convinced to forgo high prices that are unlikely to abate for some time, meaning officials could rush into deals that later prove a poor deal for taxpayers if the spike in wholesale gas prices quickly subsides. The thinktank Ember calculates that, from 2012 until 2027, when Drax’s ROC subsidies end, it will have collected more than £11bn in government payouts. It is understood the new contracts could stretch to between 10 and 15 years, opening up the possibility that Drax could land a further decade of state support. The company has drawn criticism from scientists and campaigners who have argued that burning wood to produce electricity is far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Nuclear power station owners Centrica and EDF are keen to enter the initiative and have already begun talks with ministers. The initiative was formally unveiled hours before parliament was suspended due to Queen’s mourning period. Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP and member of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “It is vital that the terms of these renegotiated contracts receive proper parliamentary scrutiny, as it risks locking in higher prices over the longer term and continuing excessive subsidies for technologies we are moving away from as we head towards our net zero targets. “Such long-term financial decisions cannot simply be made unilaterally as a kneejerk response to our current energy crisis, and must be properly debated, with alternatives considered, before any decisions are made that cannot later be unpicked. Particular scrutiny needs to be given to any deal with Drax given the existing levels of government support.” The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government is right to be looking at ways to bring down energy bills. But they should avoid locking bill payers into expensive new 15-year contracts to subsidise sources of energy with dubious environmental credentials. Instead, we should focus on building new renewables which are nine times cheaper than gas.” The Friends of the Earth head of policy, Mike Childs, said: “During a cost of living crisis and with wind and solar power so cheap, it’s astonishing that the government is considering spending more public money on Drax. “If the company is to receive more subsidies, the government must at the very least ensure full transparency and proper parliamentary scrutiny.” Truss and the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, have opposed windfall taxes, however the EU’s decision to impose an emergency levy may increase pressure on Truss to follow suit. The Times reported that some power generators believe a windfall tax would be better than being pushed to sign cut-price contracts. Drax said in July that profit before tax had jumped to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, aided by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, and has signed a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 63% to 709p, valuing the company at £2.84bn, after peaking at 831p in April. Kwarteng said last month, when he was business and energy secretary, that the importing of wood to burn in Drax power station “is not sustainable” and “doesn’t make any sense”. A Drax spokesperson said: “Drax is working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter. “We also plan to invest £3bn by 2030 in critical renewable energy infrastructure projects, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and pumped hydro storage, which will support energy security as well as jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/10/russia-ukraine-war-livehumanitarian-crisis-hugely-worse-after-kakhovka-dam-collapse-says-un-aid-chief","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-10T16:01:32Z","webTitle":"Kyiv reports advances as UK says Russian lines breached in some areas – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/10/russia-ukraine-war-livehumanitarian-crisis-hugely-worse-after-kakhovka-dam-collapse-says-un-aid-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/10/russia-ukraine-war-livehumanitarian-crisis-hugely-worse-after-kakhovka-dam-collapse-says-un-aid-chief","fields":{"headline":"Kyiv reports advances as UK says Russian lines breached in some areas – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A drone attack by Russian forces killed three people and injured 27 people, including three children, in Ukraine’s Odesa oblast region in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to Ukraine’s southern command.

Ukraine’s strategic industry minister, Oleksandr Kamyshin, called the results of an audit of 4,655 bomb shelters across Kyiv “disappointing”. The audit found that just 15% of shelters were suitable for use “without significant issues”. Another 50% were “technically suitable”, said Kamyshin, but needed work to be “put in order”. Of the shelters looked at, 44% were freely accessible, while another 21% would be opened to residents by guards within five minutes of an air raid alarm, Sky News reported. The inspections were ordered by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, last week after three people were killed in the Ukrainian capital when they were unable to access a shelter during a Russian air strike.

The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine’s forces have continued “unsuccessful” attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. Canada’s minister, Justin Trudeau, landed in Kyiv on Saturday and said Canada will be part of a multinational effort to train Ukrainian fighter pilots. He also announced C$500m ($375m) worth of military aid for Kyiv and said the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam is a “direct consequence of Russia’s war”. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Saturday that he planned to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone soon to urge him to withdraw troops from Ukraine. Russian activists and dissidents from the Anti-War Human Rights Coalition say volunteers are reporting that 1,842 left bank residents including 338 urgent cases around Olekshy, and nearby, are being prevented from leaving by Russian authorities. They also include 148 children and 243 elderly people. The latest intelligence update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence said over the past 48 hours “significant” Ukrainian operations have taken place in several sectors of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have “likely made good progress” and “penetrated the first line of Russian defences”, the MoD added. However, in other areas “Ukrainian progress has been slower”. Russia has fired missiles and attack drones at the central Ukrainian region of Poltava overnight, inflicting “some damage of infrastructure and equipment” at the Myrhorod military airfield, according to the regional governor. A £150m fund to help Ukrainians into their own homes has been announced by the UK government. More than 124,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The UK will provide an extra £16m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iceland’s decision to suspend its embassy operations in Moscow “destroys” bilateral cooperation adding the action would elicit a “corresponding” response. The southern reach of the Dnipro River is likely to return to its banks by 16 June after the breach of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam this week, a Russian-installed official said on Saturday. Vladimir Saldo said the water level at Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had now dropped by 3 metres (10 feet) from Tuesday’s peak, Reuters reported. German investigators are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to damage the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September, the Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency says it has put the last operating reactor at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant into a “cold shutdown” as a safety precaution amid flooding from the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about an upcoming mission by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine to try and broker peace, Pretoria said on Saturday. The UN has helped boost Russian exports of food and fertilisers, facilitating a steady flow of ships to its ports ahead of an important grain deal deadline. Top UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as Moscow threatens to walk away from a deal allowing the safe export of food and fertiliser from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports on 17 July if obstacles to its own shipments are not removed. The Wagner group has been accused of stoking “anarchy” on Russia’s frontlines after one of the Kremlin’s military commanders claimed Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenaries had kidnapped and tortured his soldiers during the battle for Bakhmut. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has tweeted that he is in Kyiv to “reaffirm” Canada’s commitment to Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people “as they maintain their resistance against Russia’s brutal war”. President Zelenskiy has also tweeted on Trudeau’s visit saying “in our victory, we will stand together just as we are standing now – on our way to defend life and people”. South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about an upcoming mission by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine to try and broker peace, Pretoria said on Saturday. Ramaphosa announced last month that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, had agreed to receive a six-member African delegation, expected to visit this month. The delegation will group the presidents of the Republic of Congo, Egypt, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia. Ramaphosa’s office did not specify when he spoke to Xi but said the Chinese leader “commended the initiative by the African continent and acknowledged the impact the conflict has had on human lives and on food security in Africa”, Reuters reported. China says it is a neutral party but it has been criticised for refusing to condemn Moscow for its offensive and for its close strategic partnership with Russia. African countries have been badly hit by rising prices for grain since Russia invaded Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine’s forces have continued “unsuccessful” attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that Ukrainian forces had begun their expected counteroffensive in intense fighting in Ukraine, but that every attempted advance had failed, at a heavy cost in casualties. This has not been independently verified. Russia has threatened to walk away from the Black Sea grain deal if demands to improve its own food and fertiliser exports are not met, deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin said on Saturday. The deal struck last July facilitates the “safe navigation” of grain, foodstuffs and fertilisers - including ammonia - for export to global markets. Vershinin was quoted as saying: We cannot be satisfied with how this memorandum is being implemented. Barriers to our exports remain. While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments. More on Ukraine’s counteroffensive coming in from Reuters: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that counteroffensive and defensive operations were taking place in Ukraine, but told reporters that he would not say what stage they were at. Zelenskiy shrugged and raised his eyebrows dismissively at a press conference in Kyiv when asked to respond after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that Kyiv forces had certainly begun their much-vaunted counteroffensive. More news is coming in from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s trip to Kyiv. Trudeau said the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam is a “direct consequence of Russia’s war”, Reuters reported. Trudeau also said that Canada was seizing a Russian-owned Antonov cargo aircraft that landed in Canada last year and starting the process of forfeiting the aircraft to Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said counteroffensive and defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine but would not say which stage they were at, Reuters reported. Canada will be part of a multinational effort to train Ukrainian fighter pilots, President Justin Trudeau has said. Trudeau, who is on a visit to Ukraine, also announced C$500m ($375m) worth of military aid for Kyiv. Of course the Russians did it. Blowing up Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine last week was cowardly – Vladimir Putin’s long-planned response to what he fears is the start of Kyiv’s counteroffensive. Only Russians really had the means, motive and opportunity. Only this malevolent Kremlin regime would wilfully inflict human and environmental havoc on so vast a scale. It’s impossible to prove at this point. And, of course, Putin’s loathsome sycophants lied about it, blaming Ukrainian self-sabotage. That’s what they do, these mobsters. They lied about the Russian-supplied missile that destroyed Flight MH17 over occupied Donbas in 2014. They lied about the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Putin lied blatantly about invading Ukraine, right up to the moment he did. Putin, Lavrov, Medvedev, Shoigu, Peskov and the gang have been lying through their teeth ever since – even as their absurdly neo-imperial “special operation” imploded, Russia’s soldiers died in droves, Ukraine’s cities burned, and reports of war crimes piled up like tortured bodies in a Bucha basement. It’s pathological. They lie to the world, to their people, to themselves. Where is the international fury over Kakhovka? The condemnation of US and European leaders seems almost routine, leaving who is responsible open to question. Western media politely parroted Russian lies, giving time and credence to Kremlin disinformation, as if bogus editorial balance matters more than state murder. You can read the full report here. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Saturday that Iceland’s decision to suspend its embassy operations in Moscow “destroys” bilateral cooperation adding the action would elicit a “corresponding” response. Iceland said on Friday the operations would be suspended from 1 August due to an “all-time low” level of commercial, cultural and political relations between the countries. It said it had asked Russia to scale back its diplomatic activities in Reykjavik, Reuters reported. The Russian foreign ministry said: The decision taken by the Icelandic authorities to lower the level of diplomatic relations with Russia destroys the entire range of Russian-Icelandic cooperation. We will take this unfriendly decision into account when building our ties with Iceland in the future. All anti-Russian actions of Reykjavik will inevitably be followed by a corresponding reaction. When announcing its decision, Iceland said diplomatic relations had not been severed and that the embassy would be reopened once normal relations resumed. The UK will provide an extra £16m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The money consists of £10m for the Red Cross Movement, £5m for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and £1m for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders will be given to Ukraine and are expected to arrive there next week. Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, Andriy Melnyk, tweeted “Welcome to Ukraine Mr Prime Minister” on the arrival of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in Kyiv. He accompanied the post with a photograph of them shaking hands on the platform of a train station. Counterattacking Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 1,400 metres at a number of sections of the front line near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the past day, a military spokesperson said on Saturday. The advance is the latest in a series of similar gains reported this week by Kyiv near Bakhmut, which Russia said it had fully captured last month after the bloodiest and longest battle since it began its full-scale invasion in February 2022. “We’re trying … to conduct strikes on the enemy, we’re counterattacking. We’ve managed to advance up to 1,400 metres on various sections of the front,” the spokesperson for the eastern military command said when asked about fighting near Bakhmut. Serhiy Cherevaty, the official, said in televised comments that Russian forces were trying to counterattack but that they had not been successful, Reuters reported. Ukrainian forces, he added, had inflicted heavy Russian troop casualties and destroyed military hardware in the area. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify this. Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency says it has put the last operating reactor at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant into a “cold shutdown” as a safety precaution amid flooding from the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. Five out of six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces, are already in a state of cold shutdown. Energoatom, the Ukrainian nuclear agency, said in a statement late on Friday that there was “no direct threat” to the Zaporizhzhia plant due to the breach of the Kakhovka dam further down the Dnieper River, which has forced thousands of people to flee flooding and also sharply reduced water levels in a reservoir used to help cool the facility. The last reactor was put into cold shutdown on Thursday, Energoatom said. The site’s power units have not been operating since September last year. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is due to visit Ukraine in the coming days. Here are some more images of Justin Trudeau in Ukraine. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Saturday that he planned to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone soon to urge him to withdraw troops from Ukraine. Speaking at a convention of the German Protestant church in Nuremberg, Scholz said he had spoken to Putin on the phone in the past. “I plan to do it again soon,” he added. Here’s some more on Justin Trudeau’s visit to Ukraine. Trudeau paid his respects at a memorial site in central Kyiv to Ukrainian soldiers who have been killed fighting pro-Russian forces since 2014, Reuters reported. Nato member Canada, which has one of the world’s largest Ukrainian diasporas, has supplied military and financial assistance to Ukraine during the full-scale invasion launched by Russia in February 2022. Russian activists and dissidents from the Anti-War Human Rights Coalition say volunteers are reporting that 1,842 left bank residents including 338 urgent cases around Olekshy, and nearby, are being prevented from leaving by Russian authorities. They also include 148 children and 243 elderly people. The coalition has sent a letter to the US calling for diplomatic pressure to be put on Moscow to allow humanitarian relief. The letter says: The Ukrainian government has appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross, but currently did not receive any feedback. We request you to use diplomatic means to ensure that the Russian side provides assistance to the affected residents of Oleshki, or that the Russian side stops hindering the work of the volunteers willing to help the victims. “At the same time we would like to appeal to the Red Cross to interfere and provide humanitarian aid as it is near impossible for local volunteers to evacuate such an amount of people with the means available. Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has arrived in Kyiv. Footage from the BBC shows Trudeau in the capital. A £150m fund to help Ukrainians into their own homes has been announced by the UK government. More than 124,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The new money will go to councils to help Ukrainian families into private rented accommodation and find work. It will also go towards continuing sponsorship arrangements, as many guests are in their second year in the UK. The funding is being divided according to the number of Ukrainians in each nation – England will receive about £109m, Scotland £30m, Wales £8m and Northern Ireland £2m. Read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us from the wires. The southern reach of the Dnipro River is likely to return to its banks by 16 June after the breach of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam this week, a Russian-installed official said on Saturday. Vladimir Saldo, who heads the Russian-controlled part, said the water level at Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had now dropped by 3 metres (10 feet) from Tuesday’s peak, Reuters reported. “The pumping of water and garbage collection from the streets have started,” he said, adding that more than 6,000 people had been evacuated from the flooded districts of Nova Kakhovka and from Oleshky and Hola Prystan. He said preliminary calculations by the Russian hydroelectricity producer RusHydro indicated the Dnipro would return to its usual course below the now-destroyed Kakhovka power station by 16 June. This could not be independently verified. Here’s more from Prof Snyder. When asked whether he believed the counteroffensive would make good progress, he said: Military history teaches us that these things are very, very difficult to predict, but I think a lot of it hangs on, just as it does generally in war, whether the Ukrainian advances generate political pressure in Moscow and whether that political pressure leads back towards panic in the Russian front lines. I think in general, the Ukrainians have done better than people expect, and I would cautiously predict that they will do better than people expect this time as well. Yale historian Prof Timothy Snyder, who has written about Ukraine and Russia, and also about tyranny and the erosion of democracy, said he did not believe the destruction of the Kakhovka dam would ultimately affect Ukraine’s counteroffensive. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I don’t think … it will have fundamental implications for the Ukrainian counteroffensive for now. It’s diverting Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian soldiers are evacuating people. Ukrainian soldiers are using their drones to drop water onto roofs instead of grenades into Russian tanks. I think that will make a difference for a few days or a few weeks, but I think there are plenty of other directions the Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to take, and remarkably, it’s still taking those. He added it was “remarkable” that Ukraine is able to carry out a counteroffensive and a rescue operation at the same time. The latest intelligence update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence said over the past 48 hours “significant” Ukrainian operations have taken place in several sectors of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have “likely made good progress” and “penetrated the first line of Russian defences”, the MoD added. However, in other areas “Ukrainian progress has been slower”. Meanwhile, Russian performance has been “mixed”, with some units “likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields”. The update added: “The Russian Airforce has been unusually active over southern Ukraine, where the airspace is more permissive for Russia than in other parts of the country. However, it remains unclear whether tactical airstrikes have been effective.” Russia has fired missiles and attack drones at the central Ukrainian region of Poltava overnight, inflicting “some damage of infrastructure and equipment” at the Myrhorod military airfield, according to the regional governor. The attack using ballistic and cruise missiles also damaged eight private residential homes and several vehicles, but no casualties were reported. – Reuters German investigators are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to damage the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September, the Wall Street Journal reported. Investigators have fully reconstructed the two-week voyage of the “Andromeda”, a white pleasure yacht suspected of being involved in damaging the pipelines that supply Russian gas to Europe. It was pinpointed the yacht had deviated from its target to venture into Polish waters, using data from the Andromeda’s radio and navigation equipment, satellite and mobile phones, Gmail accounts “and DNA samples left aboard, which Germany has tried to match to at least one Ukrainian soldier”. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and Poland’s Office of Chancellery of the prime minister did not immediately respond for comment. The Washington Post reported this week that the US had learned of a Ukrainian plan to attack the pipelines three months before they were damaged by the underwater explosions. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told German media that Ukraine did not attack Nord Stream pipelines. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: A drone attack by Russian forces has killed three people and injured at least 10 more in Ukraine’s Odesa oblast region in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to Ukraine’s southern command. Debris from the attack hit a high-rise residential building, causing a fire that has been extinguished. The blast wave also damaged surrounding residential buildings. Emergency services said 27 people, including three children, were wounded, but the fire had been rapidly put out and 12 people were rescued from the building. Russian forces used Iranian-made drones to attack the region, all of which were shot down by Ukrainian forces, according to reports. The UN has helped boost Russian exports of food and fertilisers, facilitating a steady flow of ships to its ports ahead of an important grain deal deadline. Top UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as Moscow threatens to walk away from a deal allowing the safe export of food and fertiliser from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports on 17 July if obstacles to its own shipments are not removed. To convince Moscow to agree to the pact known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative – brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year – a three-year agreement was struck at the same time under which UN officials agreed to help Russia with its own food and fertiliser exports. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said “the past months have shown tangible progress” on improving Russian exports, but added: “Challenges remain but we will spare no effort to overcome all remaining obstacles.” Russia’s ambassador to Turkey said that while Moscow continues talks with the UN on the Black Sea grain deal, there are no grounds to extend it beyond 17 July. The Wagner group has been accused of stoking “anarchy” on Russia’s frontlines after one of the Kremlin’s military commanders claimed Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenaries had kidnapped and tortured his soldiers during the battle for Bakhmut. In a video posted online, Lt Col Roman Venevitin also accused Wagner soldiers of stealing arms, forcing mobilised soldiers to sign contracts with Wagner, and attempting to extort weapons from the Russian defence ministry in exchange for releasing kidnapped soldiers. For more details, here’s the full story: Russia and Ukraine are tussling over control of Ukraine’s counteroffensive narrative as both Moscow and Kyiv reported heavy fighting in the south-central Zaporizhzhia region. Russian president Vladimir Putin confirmed the Ukrainian offensive had begun but said the troops “did not achieve their goals in any sector”. Ukraine’s president Voldymyr Zelenskiy did not make direct reference to developments in the battlefield but praised his soldiers’ “heroism”. While some bloggers have described the first sightings of German and US armour signalling that the Ukrainian counteroffensive was under way, there’s virtually no independent reporting from the frontlines. Ukraine’s counteroffensive is ultimately expected to involve thousands of troops trained and equipped by the west. The US announced an extra $2.1bn in security assistance on Friday, including air defence and ammunition. UN’s top aid official Martin Griffiths has warned Ukraine faces a “hugely worse” humanitarian situation than before after the collapse of the Kakhova dam. This is a viral problem. The truth is this is only the beginning of seeing the consequences of this act. Griffiths says an “extraordinary” 700,000 people are in need of drinking water and the flooding of agricultural land in one of the world’s most important breadbaskets will cause a “cascade of problems”, including lower grain exports, higher food prices around the world, and less to eat for millions in need. Working mainly through Ukrainian aid groups, the UN has reached 30,000 people in flooded areas under Ukrainian control. Griffiths said he met with Russia’s UN ambassador for access to Russian-controlled areas in order to help flood victims. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine, I’m Yang Tian bringing you the latest. UN’s top aid official warns Ukraine’s humanitarian situation has been made “hugely worse” with the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Martin Griffiths said an “extraordinary” 700,000 people are in need of drinking water and flooding in one of the word’s critical breadbaskets could lead to lower grain exports and less food for millions in need. More details shortly, in other key developments: Russian president Vladimir Putin said Ukraine had begun its counteroffensive against Russian troops but that efforts “so far have failed” after Moscow said it repelled several Ukrainian assaults. However, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no formal announcement of specific developments on the battlefield, but praised the “heroism” of his country’s soldiers fighting “tough battles”. Water levels are gradually receding in parts of southern Ukraine that were flooded after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, according to officials. Meanwhile, evidence is growing that the dam was blown up after seismic data showed there was a blast at the site in the early hours of Tuesday. Norsar, the Norwegian Seismic Array, said signals from a regional station in Romania pointed to an explosion at 2.54am. Norsar did not draw conclusions on who was responsible. The US said Russia appeared to be deepening its defence cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it is using to strike Ukraine. Citing newly declassified information, the White House said the drones were built in Iran, shipped across the Caspian Sea and then used by Russian forces against Ukraine. The Wagner group has been accused of stoking “anarchy” on Russia’s frontlines after one of the Kremlin’s military commanders claimed Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenaries had kidnapped and tortured his soldiers during the battle for Bakhmut. In a video posted online, Lt Col Roman Venevitin also accused Wagner soldiers of stealing arms, forcing mobilised soldiers to sign contracts with Wagner, and attempting to extort weapons from the Russian defence ministry in exchange for releasing kidnapped soldiers. Iceland announced it would suspend work at its embassy in Russia as of 1 August, the first country to do so, and asked Russia to limit its operations in Reykjavik. “The current situation simply does not make it viable for the small foreign service of Iceland to operate an embassy in Russia,” foreign minister Thordis Gylfadottir said. Russia will start deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus after the facilities are ready on 7-8 July, Putin told his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko on Friday in a meeting in Sochi, Russia. Nato allies on Friday condemned Russia’s decision to withdraw from the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe (CFE). Hungary said on Friday it had received a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war from Russia, a release that Ukraine welcomed while expressing concern that it had not been informed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Joe Biden for his $2.1bn (£1.6bn) security assistance package. In a tweet, Zelenskiy said the contribution is “more important than ever” since the Kakhovka dam collapse. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, told Zelenskiy on Friday that Japan will offer emergency humanitarian aid worth about $5m (£3.9m) after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, a Japanese government spokesperson has said. Ukraine’s domestic Security Service (SBU) said on Friday it had intercepted a telephone call proving a Russian “sabotage group” blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and dam in southern Ukraine. A one-and-a-half minute audio clip on its Telegram channel of the alleged conversation featured two unidentified men who appeared to be discussing the fallout from the disaster in Russian. One of the men said “Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned.” The Kremlin on Friday accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilian victims of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine in repeated shelling attacks, including one pregnant woman. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the purported attacks “barbaric”. Russia did not provide any evidence to back up its claims. Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on Friday that Crimea’s water supply will not be affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, and the peninsula had enough water reserves for 500 days. A canal from the destroyed reservoir fed drinking water to the peninsula. Kyiv cut access to the canal in 2014, after Russia illegally seized Crimea and claimed to annex it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/peter-dutton-has-reached-into-the-weeds-of-the-climate-wars-and-pulled-out-nuclear-energy-its-beyond-ludicrous","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T11:31:57Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton has reached into the weeds of the climate wars and pulled out nuclear energy.

It’s beyond ludicrous","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I understand patience is a virtue, but it’s not an inexhaustible commodity – particularly when a party of government continues to have a lend of the Australian public in such extravagant fashion over such a long period of time. Peter Dutton has made his captain’s call to oppose Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target for two reasons: to force Anthony Albanese to do a parliamentary deal with the Greens, a situation he senses is risky for Labor politically; and to reserve the right to engage in more weaponised bollocks by blaming rising consumer prices on Labor’s new 2030 target. Dutton’s big partisan play was formalised on Monday night by the shadow cabinet with only a minimum of pushback. Then it was rubber stamped by the Coalition party room on Tuesday morning with only the minimum of pushback. What’s happening now is dead simple: later this week in the House of Representatives, the Liberal and National parties will once again vote against any form of serious emissions reduction. That’s the truth. Voting against action to combat the climate crisis. This behaviour needs to be called for what it is. But Dutton obviously needed something to say on Tuesday apart from, I am an absolute shocker who is leading a political party that can’t seem to face up to the responsibility of leadership grounded in evidence, reason, and prudent risk management, so he sailed forth with news. There would be a review into nuclear energy. If you haven’t been at this deranged rodeo for as long as I have, you may not know nuclear power has practical utility for the Liberal party. Colleagues invoked the prospect of nuclear back in 2006 as a means of leading John Howard to accept the inevitability of carbon pricing. Nuclear energy would need a carbon price in order to be viable, so that technology was a pathway to lead a conservative like Howard to accept emissions trading – a position the Liberals then held until Tony Abbott thought it was politically convenient to weaponise emissions trading as a “carbon tax” and use that to blast the Coalition back into government. Now nuclear is being invoked to leash the Nationals and give the After Dark roster on Sky News something to have #BigFeelings™ about while Liberals work out how on earth to regroup on climate policy over the next three years. Dutton said on Tuesday his new nuclear review would be led by Ted O’Brien. Who, you ask? O’Brien is the new shadow minister for climate change and energy. Dutton then declared it was “high time that Australia had an honest and informed debate on the benefits and costs of nuclear energy”. High time is possibly a little insulting to O’Brien. Back in 2019, when O’Brien was chair of federal parliament’s standing committee on environment and energy, he authored a report intended – as O’Brien put it at the time – to provide “a way forward for nuclear technology in Australia”. Sadly, O’Brien’s path forward proved to be very short. Emerging nuclear technologies only rated a cursory mention in the Morrison government’s subsequent technology roadmap. These technologies had “potential but require R&amp;D and identified deployment pathways”. Here was the sound of an issue being kicked forcefully into the long grass. The Coalition has just been in power for nine years. It had the power to progress a domestic nuclear industry. It didn’t. Now, in opposition, we’ll have O’Brien (2022) agreeing with O’Brien (ignored in 2019), or possibly we’ll have duelling O’Briens. Who says politics is too cruel a profession for closure? I mean no disrespect to O’Brien, who has a couple of masters degrees and proficiency in Chinese. In my book, that makes a person very bright. But what gamechanging insight can he possibly bring to an issue that’s been studied as frequently as nuclear? Only two weeks ago the CSIRO found that wind and solar remains the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia, even when considering additional integration costs arising due to the variable output of renewables, such as energy storage and transmission. In terms of the viability of small modular reactors, the CSIRO said the “status” of that technology had not changed. It said there were no prospects of any domestic projects “this decade, given the technology’s commercial immaturity and high cost”. That was two weeks ago. Back in 2006, the Switkowski review commissioned by Howard found that nuclear power was likely to be between 20% and 50% more costly to produce than power from a new coal-fired plant at current fossil fuel prices in Australia. It said nuclear would only become competitive in Australia in a system where the costs of greenhouse gas emissions were explicitly recognised, and even then, reactors would require government subsidies. Ziggy Switkowski appeared before O’Brien’s inquiry in 2019 and said there was no coherent business case to finance an Australian nuclear industry before adding: “I have emphasised that one of the things that has changed over the last decade or so is that nuclear power has got more expensive rather than less expensive”. The South Australian government, through a royal commission, also examined the viability of nuclear in 2016 and found it wasn’t a goer. I’m technology agnostic. Climate science tells us the urgent imperative is emissions reduction, so in that context, all technology should be considered. But it is beyond ludicrous for the Coalition to decline to support Labor’s new emissions reduction target on the basis that it might drive up energy prices (which is one of the current excuses) and in the same breath, hail the breakthrough prospects of nuclear energy. If the Coalition seriously wants to advance nuclear energy, then the questions it must answer are simple: 1. What carbon price are you willing to support to make this happen; 2.

In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv air defence said it shot down all drones involved. A cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses, were hit in the border village of Chernatske in Sumy, while a hospital was struck in the Dnipro district of Kherson. Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, posted a video thanking the UK for the first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks to arrive in Ukraine. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” he wrote on Twitter. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. “As promised, our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends”, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said on Monday night. “I am sure that they can make the difference on the front.” Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap Ukrainian imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. The UK and Poland will build two temporary villages in western and central Ukraine to provide housing for people who have been forced from their homes by Russia’s invasion, the UK government has said. The villages in Lviv and Poltava will offer accommodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, a fraction of the millions either displaced in Ukraine or who have fled the country since the war began more than a year ago. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. At least two people were killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were damaged or destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region on Tuesday during his tour of areas of the country that have felt the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which saw fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. Zelenskiy told the IAEA head, Rafael Grossi on Monday that safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility could not be guaranteed until Russian troops left. The pair met on Monday to discuss the management of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and had a “rich exchange” according to Grossi. Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday, learning about the operational situation and presenting awards to the military”, his office said. The UN security council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia, China and Brazil voted in favour of the motion to investigate, but it failed as it lacked the nine votes needed in the 15-nation council to carry. The US deputy ambassador Robert Wood said there was no need with separate investigations already under way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:52:45Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 396 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 396 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Maliar, went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured after the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T02:16:42Z","webTitle":"US dismisses ‘transparently false’ Russian claims of Ukraine plan to use ‘dirty bomb’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","fields":{"headline":"US dismisses ‘transparently false’ Russian claims of Ukraine plan to use ‘dirty bomb’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US has rejected as “transparently false” Russia’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory as part of an escalation of Vladimir Putin’s war. Secretary of state Antony Blinken told his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Sunday “the world would see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation”, and vowed to continue supporting Kyiv for as long as necessary. Earlier on Sunday, Kuleba denounced Moscow’s claims as “absurd” and “dangerous”, adding: “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacted swiftly to Moscow’s claims, calling for a united international response. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said in a video address on social media. “I believe that now the world should react as harshly as possible.” Zelenskiy said everyone “understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war. It was Russia who blackmailed with the radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant].” On Sunday, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, spoke to his British, French and Turkish counterparts and claimed in all three meetings that Ukraine may use a “dirty bomb”, a conventional weapon containing radioactive material. Shoigu also spoke to Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, but Moscow did not mention the dirty bomb allegations in its statement summarising that call. The Russian minister cited no evidence for this claim as he warned of “possible provocations” on the part of Kyiv. There is no evidence that Ukraine, which gave up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s, has any radioactive material in its military arsenal. The UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement: “Shoigu alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. The defence secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation.” The Institute for the Study of War said a “false flag” operation by Russia was unlikely, dismissing Shoigu’s calls as a sabre-rattling move designed to intimidate Ukraine’s western allies and split the Nato alliance. Russia faces continued military setbacks, including the likely loss of western Kherson by the end of the year, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/mar/21/australias-miners-urge-europe-to-define-nuclear-power-and-fossil-fuels-with-carbon-capture-as-sustainable","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-21T16:30:39Z","webTitle":"Australia's miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as 'sustainable'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/21/australias-miners-urge-europe-to-define-nuclear-power-and-fossil-fuels-with-carbon-capture-as-sustainable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/mar/21/australias-miners-urge-europe-to-define-nuclear-power-and-fossil-fuels-with-carbon-capture-as-sustainable","fields":{"headline":"Australia's miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as 'sustainable'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Minerals Council of Australia has weighed into a European Commission climate policy debate, urging it to back fossil fuels with carbon capture use and storage (CCS) and nuclear power on a list of environmentally friendly developments. In a written submission to the commission, the minerals council (MCA) said a proposed EU taxonomy for sustainable activities intended to shape investment under a European green deal was inconsistent in how it dealt with clean technologies because it favoured solar, wind and biofuels over nuclear and CCS. The mining lobby group said it was concerned this approach would have a flow-on effect on the types of energy investments backed by EU-based companies across the globe and “increase the cost of reducing CO2 emissions”. It called for an overhaul. InfluenceMap, a London-based thinktank that tracks corporate climate lobbying, said the MCA’s submission suggested it wanted to export its “negative approach to climate policy” by pushing for changes in other parts of the world that would allow continued use of coal and gas. The MCA submission argued there was “no valid basis” for treating CCS and nuclear differently given EU countries currently used coal, gas and nuclear. It quoted the International Energy Agency in saying emissions from existing energy fleets needed to be significantly reduced by 2030 if countries were to achieve the widely held goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The minerals council said this would require technologies such as CCS. “Underpinning the MCA’s concern is the broad-ranging investment impacts the taxonomy will have, not just within the European Union but anywhere European Union-based firms invest,” the submission said. But InfluenceMap’s program manager, Rebecca Vaughan, said the MCA appeared concerned a science-led approach to dealing with the climate crisis would hurt the industries it represented. “While the MCA says it wants the EU to take a technology neutral position, its submission appears to advocate for the continued use of coal and gas with carbon capture utilisation and storage, which is clearly at odds with the commission’s science-based policy,” Vaughan said. The MCA has long been accused of hindering action to tackle the climate crisis in Australia, and campaigned aggressively against Labor’s two attempts to introduce a carbon pricing scheme. In recent years it has come under pressure to change its anti-climate stance from its biggest members, BHP and Rio Tinto. It followed the big mining companies facing repeated calls from their investors to abandon the MCA over its commitment to coal. It resulted in the MCA releasing a climate plan that said it was committed to the Paris agreement and reaching net zero emissions, but did not include a timeframe in which that target should be reached. The EU taxonomy is intended to help it meet a target of at least a 55% cut in its emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050. It considers a development sustainable if it makes a substantial contribution to one of six environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other five and complies with minimum business safeguards. The environmental objectives are: climate change mitigation, climate adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The commission said it expected the taxonomy would “create security for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies to plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and eventually help shift investments where they are most needed”. Tania Constable, the MCA’s chief executive, said “the technology-led transformation required” could not happen without Australia’s minerals and raw materials. She said InfluenceMap had got it wrong. “[It] clearly opposes a lowest-cost, faster-paced approach to global decarbonisation,” she said. “The MCA and all of its members are taking serious action on climate change and are committed to the Paris agreement and its goal of net zero emissions. The MCA advocates the inclusion of all low and zero emissions energy sources in the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy because unequal treatment of nuclear and CCUS in particular undermines the EU’s own objectives.” The final version of the EU’s sustainable finance rules was due in January but a decision was delayed until April after 10 countries objected to the initial proposal because they wanted gas to be deemed a sustainable energy source. Nuclear energy plays a significant role in some EU countries, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported its future was uncertain in wealthy nations as ageing plants were expected to close due to cost and regulatory decisions. It said this trend could affect climate goals. The forecast decline of nuclear has coincided with generation from cheaper renewable energy growing significantly from a low base. CCS, which most commonly involves capturing emissions and pumping them underground, remains at a relatively early stage of development despite pledges of billions of dollars in funding. It is used in some industrial processes, but has sometimes been financially viable only when employed to increase oil extraction from an underground reservoir. It is yet to be proved viable as a means of reducing emissions from fossil fuel power generation. One of the world’s most prominent CCS projects, the Petra Nova power generation facility in Texas, was mothballed last year because of its poor financial performance. The Morrison government has backed CCS as one of five priorities to receive support under its low-emissions technology roadmap, and opened a $50m fund for applications earlier this month. Several observers noted it was a relatively little funding if the government was serious about developing the long-stalled technology. Some of is expected to be will be dedicated to exploring the “use” of captured CO2 to turn it into products such as building materials. Nuclear energy remains banned in Australia. Some Coalition MPs and industry leaders want the prohibition lifted. • This article was amended on 23 March 2021 to include the EU’s criteria for a sustainable activity and the IEA’s assessment of nuclear generation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T14:09:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the partially occupied region of Zaporizhzhia, where he meet with UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency said they had “a rich exchange on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant”. In a message on Telegram, Ukraine’s president said “I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said. Zelenskiy posted to his official Telegram that“Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reported, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. Zelenskiy on Sunday urged all Ukrainians to remain engaged with developments in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. “Now, just as it was a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, real hostilities are taking place geographically far from many,” said the Ukrainian president in his nightly address. Heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said Sunday in a televised interview broadcast.

The economic affairs committee, which counts former Bank of England governor Lord King among its members, has warned Britain is at risk of a “disorderly transition” away from fossil fuels and has urged the government to set out a detailed plan including deadlines for investment decisions. The committee said the invasion of Ukraine had provided a “wake-up call” on the vulnerability of energy supplies and said there was a gap between the government’s low-carbon power generation ambitions and “practical plans for delivery”. In a report, entitled Investing in energy: price, security, and the transition to net zero, the committee made a series of recommendations. These include: a drive to improve home insulation; developing financing models for new technologies including carbon capture and storage; blue and green hydrogen; and re-examining the onshore wind sector. The peers want to see energy security objectives set alongside climate change goals in a National Planning Policy Framework and enabling short-term investment in North Sea oil and gas that will pay back quickly “to limit the risk of stranded assets”. The committee also called for the UK Infrastructure Bank to focus on “financing innovative and potentially riskier projects” and for the Treasury to definitively rule out a windfall tax on power generators. Lord Bridges of Headley, the chair of the committee, said: “I hope the next prime minister understands the needs for an operational delivery plan for net zero because we have a government that has increased ambition but now needs to join the dots between different policies to make sure that we don’t fall into a gap between ambition and delivery. The next PM needs to take this issue by the scruff of its neck and really come up with a plan to deliver.” The report comes days after the high court ordered the government to outline exactly how its net zero policies will achieve emissions targets, after a legal challenge from environmental groups. The committee hopes the government can allay concerns among businesses and investors over returns made from large-scale energy infrastructure projects. Construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant has been delayed and is billions of pounds over budget, while questions remain over the financing of its sister plant, Sizewell C, which has been proposed in Suffolk. Bridges said the UK needed to make sure that in the transition away from fossil fuels it did not become reliant on minerals that are used in renewable power technology such as solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. He said: “We need to be very focused on ensuring we don’t swap one form of dependency in terms of sources of oil and gas for another source of dependency, which is on countries that own rare earth minerals, supply chains and rare and low-carbon technology, processing and manufacturing, notably China.” In compiling the report, the committee received evidence from experts across the industry including representatives of power station operator EDF, regulator Ofgem, energy firm SSE, consultancy KPMG and Rolls-Royce, which hopes to build a fleet of mini nuclear power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-24T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘A combination of failures:’ why 3.6m pounds of nuclear waste is buried on a popular California beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","fields":{"headline":"‘A combination of failures:’ why 3.6m pounds of nuclear waste is buried on a popular California beach","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 2 million visitors flock each year to California’s San Onofre state beach, a dreamy slice of coastline just north of San Diego. The beach is popular with surfers, lies across one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the Unites States and has a 10,000-year-old sacred Native American site nearby. It even landed a shout-out in the Beach Boys’ 1963 classic Surfin’ USA. But for all the good vibes and stellar sunsets, beneath the surface hides a potential threat: 3.6m lb of nuclear waste from a group of nuclear reactors shut down nearly a decade ago. Decades of political gridlock have left it indefinitely stranded, susceptible to threats including corrosion, earthquakes and sea level rise. The San Onofre reactors are among dozens across the United States phasing out, but experts say they best represent the uncertain future of nuclear energy. “It’s a combination of failures, really,” said Gregory Jaczko, who chaired the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the top federal enforcer, between 2009 and 2012, of the situation at San Onofre. Buried waste That waste is the byproduct of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (Songs), three nuclear reactors primarily owned by the utility Southern California Edison (SCE). Federal regulators had already cited SCE for several safety issues, including leaking radioactive waste and falsified firewatch records. But when a new steam generator began leaking a small amount of radioactivity in January 2012, just one year after it was replaced, it was SCE’s most serious problem yet. A subsequent report from the NRC’s inspector general found federal inspectors had overlooked red flags in 2009, and that SCE had replaced its own steam generators without proper approval. SCE tried to fix the problem but decided in 2013 to shut the plant down for good. Activists thought they had scored a victory when the reactor shut down – until they learned that the nuclear waste they had produced would remain on-site. That wasn’t supposed to be the case. Under the US Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government was to move waste into a centralized, remote federal facility starting in 1998. In 2002, George W Bush approved Yucca Mountain, a site about 100 miles from Las Vegas, as a permanent underground nuclear waste repository. But in 2010, the Obama administration scrapped the controversial plan. Without a government-designated place to store the waste, the California Coastal Commission in 2015 approved the construction of an installation at San Onofre to store it until 2035. In August 2020, workers concluded the multi-year burial process, loading the last of 73 canisters of waste into a concrete enclosure. San Onofre is not the only place where waste is left stranded. As more nuclear sites shut down, communities across the country are stuck with the waste left behind. Spent fuel is stored at 76 reactor sites in 34 states, according to the Department of Energy. Handling those stockpiles has been an afterthought to the NRC, the federal enforcer, said Allison Macfarlane, another former commission chair. “It was not a big topic at the NRC, unfortunately,” Macfarlane said. “In the nuclear industry in general the backend of the nuclear cycle gets very little attention. So it just never rises to ‘oh this is a very important issue, we should be doing something.’” Plenty of risks, and not enough oversight The waste is buried about 100ft from the shoreline, along the I-5 highway, one of the nation’s busiest thoroughfares, and not far from a pair of faults that experts say could generate a 7.4 magnitude earthquake. Another potential problem is corrosion. In its 2015 approval, the Coastal Commission noted the site could have a serious impact on the environment down the line, including on coastal access and marine life. “The [installation] would eventually be exposed to coastal flooding and erosion hazards beyond its design capacity, or else would require protection by replacing or expanding the existing Songs shoreline armoring,” the document says. Concerns have also been raised about government oversight of the site. Just after San Onofre closed, SCE began seeking exemptions from the NRC’s operating rules for nuclear plants. The utility asked and received permission to loosen rules on-site, including those dealing with record-keeping, radiological emergency plans for reactors, emergency planning zones and on-site staffing. San Onofre isn’t the only closed reactor to receive exemptions to its operating licence. The NRC’s regulations historically focused on operating reactors and assumed that, when a reactor shut down, the waste would be removed quickly. It’s true that the risk of accidents decreases when a plant isn’t operating, said Dave Lochbaum, former director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists. But adapting regulations through exemptions greatly reduces public transparency, he argued. “Exemptions are wink-wink, nudge-nudge deals with the NRC,” he said. “In general, it’s not really a great practice,” former NRC chair Jaczko said about the exemptions. “If the NRC is regulating by exemption, it means that there’s something wrong with the rules … either the NRC believes the rules are not effective, and they’re not really useful, or the NRC is not holding the line where the NRC should be holding line,” he said. Close calls In 2015, the NRC tried unsuccessfully to revise its decommissioning rules and reduce the need for exemptions. But commissioners never acted, despite a 2019 Office of Inspector General audit that questioned whether the rule would ever see the light of day and that estimated that eliminating exemptions could save the NRC, utility and taxpayers about $19m for each reactor. “The problem you have here is that the NRC is simply not doing its job as a regulator. So what it has done is allowed the industry to basically determine the conditions under which this material is stored on a temporary basis across the country,” echoed retired Rear Admiral Len Hering, who served more than 30 years in the US navy and was awarded a 2005 presidential award for leadership in federal energy management from President George W Bush. Meanwhile, at San Onofre, two close calls drew the ire of activists and townspeople. In 2018, workers found a loose piece of equipment in one of the canisters, causing a 10-day work stoppage to ensure the error didn’t pose a threat to the public. In a separate incident several months later, a canister filled with radioactive waste became wedged when employees were loading it into the ground and nearly dropped 18ft. The second incident was not made public until a whistleblower brought it up at a community event. After these incidents, the NRC cited SCE for failing to ensure equipment was available to protect the canister from a drop, and failing to notify the NRC in a timely manner. In a memo, NRC staff told SCE it was “concerned about apparent weaknesses” in managing storage oversight. SCE was fined $116,000 but permitted to continue loading casks within one year. Another concern is that the CEO of Holtec, the manufacturer of the canisters, told a 2014 community meeting that the canisters are difficult to repair. “It’s not practical to repair a canister if it were damaged,” Kris Singh said. Singh walked that statement back last September, but questions remain as to what San Onofre would do if a canister did indeed appear damaged. According to a plan the California Coastal Commission approved in July 2020, SCE will also inspect two of the 73 buried canisters every five years, and a test canister every two and a half years, starting in 2024. But critics say they are not confident SCE would self-report given the utility’s record. “It’s a self-reporting industry,” Hering, the retired rear admiral, said. “And they simply can’t be trusted.” Thinking about ‘how systems will fail’ Holtec did not responded to requests for comment for this story. In an email, a spokesman for the NRC declined to comment on the 2018 incidents at San Onofre, and said that possible accidents are significantly fewer than at an operating reactor. “The NRC has thoroughly reviewed this issue and believes that the spent fuel can be stored safely on site at San Onofre. It can’t be moved off site because there is no federally approved disposal site for high-level waste, although we are currently reviewing two applications for interim storage facilities in west Texas and New Mexico,” the spokesman said. Al Bates, manager of regulatory affairs at San Onofre, said there was a probability that incidents “manmade or by Mother Nature” might happen at San Onofre. But if they do, he said, there would be little impact on public safety. “The fact of the matter is, there’s, yes, it’s high-level nuclear waste. But, yes, the technologies that we’re using are extremely robust for any possible scenarios,” he said. He also disputed that the exemption process leaves the public out of the process, noting that requests are public record and that SCE adds information about decommissioning to its website and through a community panel. “It’s an open book,” Bates said. “We’re not trying to get away with anything. We’re doing the same thing that other utilities have done to rightsize regulations around the true nature of decommissioning and the fact that decommissioning is a much lower risk to the public … therefore regulations have to correctly acknowledge that.” “We have no motivation to hide anything. As a matter of fact, if you want to lose your job in nuclear power try to hide something – you’ll never work in nuclear power again,” said Randall Granaas, senior nuclear engineer at San Onofre. John Dobken, spokesperson for Songs, also stressed that the waste is stored safely, but said the right thing to do would be to relocate the waste off-site – a decision only the government can make. “It’s important to know there are some who want to make this about fear and it shouldn’t be about fear,” he said. “It should be about doing the right thing, and the right thing is about relocating the spent fuel from an interim storage site and eventually into a geological repository, and that’s what we’re working towards.” However, many of these potential problems might have been avoided, Jaczko said, if SCE had considered another location for its fuel, instead of leaving it on the reactor site, or if it had more adequately consulted with the community. “I think that a better solution could be had with a little bit more work. And it wasn’t done and now it’s created this very polarized community that has strong concerns about what’s being done and doesn’t feel like they’re being listened to. And they’re not,” he said. It’s worth considering how things fail, though, argued Rod Ewing, nuclear security professor at Stanford University’s center for international security and cooperation, and author of a 2021 report about spent nuclear waste that focuses on San Onofre. “The problem with our safety analysis approach is we spend a lot of time proving things are safe. We don’t spend much time imagining how systems will fail,” he said. “And I think the latter is what’s most important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T18:30:14Z","webTitle":"Putin threatens to ‘freeze’ west by cutting oil and gas supplies if EU imposes price cap – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","fields":{"headline":"Putin threatens to ‘freeze’ west by cutting oil and gas supplies if EU imposes price cap – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, according to reports. Ukraine’s goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said. Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on “almost the entire southern frontline”, Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. The strikes used missiles or rockets and 10 warplanes were destroyed, he said. The attacks Zaluzhnyi took responsibility for reportedly included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a day after the UN called for a demilitarised zone around the plant. A local official said the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Remarks by Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection or shield around the perimeter of the facility. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said, warning that Russia would “sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen”. The leader of Russia’s governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said it would be “correct and symbolic” to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told reporters. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. James Cleverly has reaffirmed the UK’s “steadfast support” for Ukraine in his first call as foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said he spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday. In a statement shared on social media, Cleverly said: I just spoke to Dmytro Kuleba in my first call as foreign secretary. I reaffirmed the UK’s steadfast support for Ukraine as they resist Putin’s barbaric invasion. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all and I will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom. The leader of Russia’s governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said it would be “correct and symbolic” to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Pro-Russian officials in occupied parts of Ukraine had previously suggested that a referendum on joining Russia would be held on 11 September. But on Monday, Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine said they are “pausing” a planned referendum because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Writing on his party’s website today, Turchak said that in any case, voting would “definitely” take place this year. Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on “almost the entire southern frontline”, Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said in an interview with France 24. The Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to be “progressing well”, he said, adding: The Russians seem surprised by the methods used. The destruction of ammunition depots and logistical hubs, particularly the railroads, have considerably destabilised them. Today, if the forces stationed west of the Dnieper River no longer receive shells, they will no longer be able to defend themselves. If they no longer receive food, it will be dramatic for some units. He also said: I think that before the winter, the Ukrainians could take over the whole right bank of the Dnieper, including the city of Kherson. If Ukraine succeeded in retaking this region, it would be a “major coup” and would be “very damaging” for Vladimir Putin, he added. Russian natural gas deliveries to the EU have dropped by 48% so far this year, according to the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Russia is in talks about a major infrastructure project to deliver gas to China via Mongolia, Vladimir Putin said earlier today. Gazprom has for years explored the possibility of supplying gas to China via Mongolia through a gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2. The proposed pipeline could carry 50bn cubic metres of natural gas a year, Gazprom has said, which is slightly less than the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. In a televised meeting with Mongolia’s prime minister, Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene, Putin said: We are in discussions about the possible implementation of a major infrastructure project, I mean the supply of Russian gas to China via Mongolia. The Kyiv Independent’s defence reporter, Illia Ponomarenko, has said “something incredible” is happening in the north-east Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region is reportedly seeing some success. On Tuesday, a Moscow-appointed official in the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces had “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. The Wall Street Journal’s Yaroslav Trofimov reports that the speed of Ukraine’s advance has left many stunned. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, CNN reports. Since launching its counteroffensive last week, Ukrainian forces have made gains in the south with ambitious ground assaults after sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the frontlines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has seen Ukraine achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka. Nova Kakhovka houses an important hydroelectric plant as well as a canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukraine has stepped up attacks in the east of the country in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the south to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, according to US officials. Ukraine’s goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said. Vladimir Putin has said he wants to revise a fragile international agreement to allow the export of Ukrainian grain in a move that could threaten the deal and revive fears of a renewed Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, issuing a false claim that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. The divisive statements came during a speech in which Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. The speech, nominally dedicated to the economy and trade, was one of the Russian leader’s most belligerent and defiant since the beginning of the Ukraine war. At one point, Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war that has killed tens of thousands of people, including thousands of its own soldiers. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” said Putin, when asked about the cost of the invasion, which began more than six months ago. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. In a post on Telegram, Vereshchuk said: I appeal to the residents of the districts adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant … evacuate! Find a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has spoken with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pledge his country’s continued support for Kyiv, a German government spokesperson said. The pair discussed further ways to help Ukraine, including measures to assist in the country’s reconstruction, the spokesperson said. During the call, Scholz outlined intense preparations for an international conference on this matter, to be held in Berlin on 25 October, they added. Scholz and Zelenskiy also agreed that protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was of great importance, and backed measures recommended in yesterday’s IAEA report which called for a protection zone around the site. Britain’s newly appointed foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has spoken with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, to discuss working together to persuade other countries to support Kyiv against Russia’s invasion, Kuleba said. Kuleba tweeted that he and Cleverly “see eye to eye on the main goal: Ukraine must win”. He added: We will work actively together to persuade others across the globe to support it, especially those who may still have doubts. The Ukrainian foreign minister said he was Cleverly’s first call following his appointment by Liz Truss as her foreign minister on Tuesday. Kuleba said: The fact that our call was foreign secretary’s first speaks for itself. It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. A “parallel” Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said in the coming months, Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant Ukraine advance in the east. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea.

The report has not been independently verified. Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP).

Germany is well placed to “survive” the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Scholz vowed that Germany will keep moving “at great speed” to shed its reliance on Russia for power, adding that gas reserves were at over 86% capacity and would be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of the entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Read the full story by my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Isobel Koshiw. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a day after the UN called for a demilitarised zone around the plant. A local official told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank if the Dnieper river from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said: There are fires, blackouts and other things at the [plant] that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger. In recent days, residents have been given iodine pills to help protect them from a radiation leak. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the UN Security Council on Tuesday that “something very, very catastrophic could take place” at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant. It is feared that fighting could lead to a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl. The resumption of grain exports from Ukraine and maintaining food and fertiliser supplies contributed to a drop in global wheat prices in August, the UN has said. It came after Vladimir Putin called for talks to change the UN-brokered deal, signed in July to avoid a global food crisis, claiming exports were not going to the world’s poorest countries as planned. A UN spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative told Reuters: In August, the Food and Agriculture Organisation cereal price index decreased by 1.4% from the previous month. This drop...was due in part to the resumption of commercial exports from the Black Sea ports in Ukraine. According to UN data, Turkey, which is not part of the EU, has been the most common single destination for Ukraine shipments and that they have also been sent to China, India, Egypt, Yemen, Somalia and Djibouti. The spokesperson added: As of today...we have seen 100 ships leaving Ukrainian ports carrying over 2,334,310 metric tons of grains and other foodstuffs across three continents, including 30 percent to low and lower-middle income countries. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. In an article published by Ukrinform, a state news agency, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army said the strikes used missiles or rockets and that 10 warplanes were destroyed. The attacks he took responsibility for included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility, reports Reuters. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a windfall tax, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, said in remarks broadcast by Ukrainian TV: One of the ways to create a security zone at the ZNPP could be to set up a peacekeeping contingent there and withdraw Russian troops. Kotyn’s remarks came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Former UK defence secretary Michael Fallon clashed with the French president Emmanuel Macron saying he did not understand those who say that Russian president Vladimir Putin should not be left humiliated at the end of the Ukraine war. Macron has at times called for Putin not to win, but also not to be humiliated. But Fallon, speaking at an economic forum in Poland, said: I do not understand people that say that Putin must not be humiliated by failure. He needs to fail and to be humiliated if we are not to concede he has any kind of legitimate right to be any part of Ukraine. If we weaken now by allowing Russia to continue along this path it seems the Baltic States, Moldova, Georgia, the West Balkans - all of them - will be vulnerable in the future. Fallon was defence secretary from 2014 and 2017 in the wake of the Russian-led incursion into Ukraine, and in his remarks described the West’s response at the time as feeble. He also called for the West to consider providing Ukraine with a modern air defence iron dome as a permanent form of security against future Russian attacks, possibly with a Polish contribution. Describing the state of the military counter-offensive inside Ukraine as “at a delicate stage”, he said the level of sanctions against Russia should not only be stepped up, but enforced since some countries were allowing Russian oil to be retankered and relabelled in international customs. He added: Politicians need to better and more fully explain the sacrifice that is going to be required not just in the field of energy but in terms of fiscal transfers. This is a war not just of territory but of principle. Fallon also called for the Russian middle class to be banned from travelling across Europe: Young Russians can enjoy the beaches of the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea whereas every young Ukrainians has in one way or another to defend their country. Even in an autocratic regime where the media is controlled, you cannot exempt the Russian population from proper responsibility for what is being done in their name. He also revealed his deep exasperation with Europe’s response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. He said Putin noticed the west’s weak response to the Maidan in 2004, when the European Union proved itself wholly unable to defend a fragile democracy. Putin noticed again when Europe applied only limited sanctions after the seizure of Crimea, excluding oil and gas, and unbelievably allowing 10 European countries to honour their existing arms contracts to Russia supplying weapons that even today are being used against Ukraine. Above all, Putin noted the lack of a clear path for Nato and EU membership, Fallon said. He said Poland by contrast recognised what Putin represented long before the rest of Europe, and called on the UK to build its ad hoc defence links with Poland and Ukraine in the future. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told reporters. Denisov was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: We are actively preparing for it. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. It would also be the Chinese leader’s first overseas trip since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Xi has only left mainland China once since the start of the pandemic, to make a one-day visit to Hong Kong. The summit “promises to be interesting”, Denisov was also cited as saying. He added: I do not want to say that online summits are not full-fledged, but still, direct communication between leaders is a different quality of discussion … We are planning a serious, full-fledged meeting of our leaders with a detailed agenda, which we are now, in fact, working on with our Chinese partners. When asked about the trip, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said he had “nothing to offer” and did not provide any information. Germany is well placed to “survive” the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Scholz vowed that Germany will keep moving “at great speed” to shed its reliance on Russia for power, in a speech to parliament that was heavily critical of his predecessor chancellor Angela Merkel’s energy policies. Germany has worked effectively to fill up its gas storage tanks and by speeding up the building of terminals to receive liquefied natural gas, Scholz said. The gas reserves, currently over 86% capacity, will be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. He added: Because we started so early, when it wasn’t even such a big awareness of the problem in Germany, we are now in a situation that we can head into the winter courageously and bravely - our country can survive. He said he was working to seal new cooperation with close European partners in order to “guarantee a secure energy supply” for the country. We have spoken with our friends on the west European coast, with the Netherlands and Belgium for them to expand (LNG) terminals and pipeline capacities with France which will for the first time deliver gas to us. Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Speaking at an economic forum in Vladivostok in Russia’s far east, the president said Russia “will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests … We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” A Ukrainian presidential adviser has described Russian complaints about a landmark deal allowing Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea as “flabbergasting”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Reuters: The agreements signed in Istanbul … concern only one issue, and that is the transfer of cargo ships through the Black Sea. He added: Russia can’t dictate where Ukraine should send its grain, and Ukraine doesn’t dictate the same to Russia. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced sanctions against a number of European military leaders and security figures in response to what Moscow described as the west’s “unfriendly anti-Russian” policy. In a statement, it said it was banning a number of the European military leaders, senior security figures and representatives of weapons companies from entering Russia. The ministry did not name the individuals. Speaking at an economic forum in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. The Russian leader described European calls for a price cap on Russian gas as “stupid” and said they would lead to higher global prices and economic problems in Europe. Last week, G7 countries agreed on a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlin’s war coffers. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said. The Russian president said: Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we won’t fulfill them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. He added: We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything. Russia “would only have one thing left to do”, Putin said. As in the famous Russian fairytale, we would sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen. He said Germany and western countries themselves were to blame for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline not being operational and that Ukraine and Poland decided on their own to switch off other gas routes into Europe. He added: Nord Steam 1 is practically closed now. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of threatening Europe’s nuclear security by shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and claimed Russia had no military equipment at the facility. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection around the perimeter of the facility. The UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” IAEA chief Grossi warned. The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. UN secretary general, António Guterres, urged the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in, and said he supported the recommendations put forward by the IAEA’s Grossi. Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izyum would become vulnerable on their north-west flank. Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television that a “counter-attack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that.” Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. A “parallel” Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said in the coming months, Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant Ukraine advance in the east. Vladimir Putin has said western sanctions on Russia were short-sighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he also claimed the developing world had been “cheated” by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss and her US counterpart Joe Biden have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Truss’s call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called ”extreme economic problems caused by Putin’s war”. Putin said the way Britain chooses its leaders is “far from democratic”, a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Truss’s appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, not by the whole country. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. A Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. Russian officials have alleged that Ukraine was behind the attack on Col Artyom Bardin. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. Putin has also said that Ukraine had threatened Europe’s nuclear security by shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and that Russia had no military equipment at the facility. Reuters reports: The Russian president added that he trusted a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which visited the power station last week, but criticised the IAEA for not saying that Ukraine was to blame for shelling on the site. Kyiv and Moscow both blame each other for military attacks on the site which has triggered fears of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster at Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, and is worried about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. “The option of switching off the station is being assessed,” Oleh Korikov said during a news briefing on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has said the way Britain chooses its leaders is “far from democratic”, a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Truss’s appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, and not by the whole country. “The people of Great Britain don’t take part, in this instance, in the change of government. The ruling elites there have their arrangements,” Putin told an economic forum in Vladivostok. Vladimir Putin has claimed that Russia had not lost anything in a global confrontation with the US over the conflict in Ukraine but had actually gained by setting a new sovereign course that would restore its global clout, the Russian president said on Wednesday during a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum. Reuters reports: Putin increasingly casts the conflict in Ukraine, which he calls a “special military operation”, as a turning point in history when Russia finally threw off the humiliations which accompanied the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. In an attempt to underscore Russia’s tilt towards Asia, Putin, speaking to the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian Pacific city of Vladivostok, said that the West was failing while Asia was the future. In his main speech, Putin hardly mentioned Ukraine beyond a reference to grain exports. But when asked by a moderator if anything had been lost from the conflict, Putin said Russia had gained and would emerge renewed and purged of hindrances. “We have not lost anything and will not lose anything,” Putin, Russia’s paramount leader since 1999, said. “Everything that is unnecessary, harmful and everything that prevents us from moving forward will be rejected.” “In terms of what we have gained, I can say that the main gain has been the strengthening of our sovereignty, and this is the inevitable result of what is happening now,” Putin said. “This will ultimately strengthen our country from within.” He did, though, acknowledge that the conflict had unleashed “a certain polarisation” in both the world and in Russia. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi tells CNN’s Christiane Amanpour we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the plant. “The situation continues to be very worrying,” Grossi said. “The shelling continues, so we are still facing a very grave danger. The mere fact there is continuity of attacks and shelling, deliberate or not, wittingly or unwittingly, people are hitting a nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. So I must say that the danger continues.” He continued, underlining the huge dangers posed: “I demand nuclear safety is indispensable. Nuclear security is indispensable. We are playing with fire.” When asked about the IAEA establishing a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, Grossi said there must be a differentiation between a demilitarised zone versus creating a “nuclear safety and security zone”. “What we are talking about here is the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone immediately, which is perhaps more modest than a full demilitarisation of the area, but extremely effective in getting commitment from all sides to avoid any aiming at the plant, any shelling at the plant, any use of any means and calibers of artillery in a direction of the plant.” Grossi continued: “What is urgently needed now – today – is that we agree on establishing a protection, a shield, a bubble around the perimeter of the facility. This is not something which is impossible to do – not at all. The IAEA has the mandate to protect the safety and security of the plant and the people there. I hope to consult very quickly and establish this as an interim measure in the hope that there will be further things.” When asked whether the remaining IAEA inspectors would stay at the nuclear plant as part of a permanent mission, Grossi confirmed the IAEA would remain on site. “And if somebody wants us to leave, then let that someone explain why is the IAEA forced to leave.” The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has said. Reuters reports: “In the last couple of weeks and months the border crossing by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,” he told a press conference in Lithuania. Vladimir Putin, during the same speech, also claimed that the developing world had been “cheated” by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis. Putin took aim at the deal, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, saying Ukrainian grain exports were not going to the world’s poorest countries. He said: Once again, they simply deceived developing countries and continue to deceive them. With this approach, the scale of food (supply) issues in the world will only increase, unfortunately. To our great regret, this can lead to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.” Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has said the west’s sanctions on the country were short-sighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Putin said the west had undermined the global economy with an “aggressive” attempt to impose its dominance across the world. He added that Russia had done everything it could to ensure Ukraine was able to export grain, but that problems in the global food market were likely to intensify and that a humanitarian catastrophe was looming. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss and her US counterpart Joe Biden have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Truss’s call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called ”extreme economic problems caused by Putin’s war”. Biden and Truss “reinforced their commitment to strengthening global liberty, tackling the risks posed by autocracies and ensuring Putin fails in Ukraine”, according to Downing Street. No 10 noted the “enduring strength of the special relationship” with the US, something that appeared at times strained during the reign of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. The leaders also committed to deepening alliances through Nato and the Aukus defence pact, established to counter China’s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. The White House said the leaders discussed close cooperation to help Ukraine “defend itself against Russian aggression”, as well as the challenges posed by China, Iran’s ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons, securing sustainable and affordable energy and the need to protect the Good Friday agreement. Truss’s first call to a foreign leader was to Zelenskiy. The prime minister, who is the UK’s fourth Conservative prime minister in six years, told him “Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term” and deplored Putin’s attempts to weaponise energy. Accepting an invitation to visit Ukraine soon, the new prime minister said it was “vital Russia’s blackmail did not deter the west from ensuring Putin fails”, according to Downing Street. Honoured to be the object of Truss’s first call, Zelenskiy hailed what he said would be a “profound and productive relationship” with the new leader, with whom he discussed how to increase the pressure on Russia and raise the costs of its invasion. “It is very important that Great Britain retains a leadership role in consolidating the free world and protecting freedom,” he said. A Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukraine was behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. “Photo of the destroyed pontoon bridge near Darivka in the Kherson Region,” the force said in a Telegram update. “The Rashists [Russians] used it to cross the Ingulets River.” The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. “Approximately 250 meters from the crossing, the satellite also recorded a cluster of Russian military equipment and a large number of trenches,” the force added. Moscow has sent a request to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requesting “additional explanations” on some areas in their report following a visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the request had been made on Wednesday, according to Russian media outlets. Other Russian officials have criticised the agency for not identifying Ukraine as the perpetrator of attacks on the plant. A “parallel” counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said on Telegram late on Tuesday night: We are advancing and pressing almost along the entire frontline. In the coming months, we can expect the defeat of the Russian army in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant advance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the east.” Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. The town of 27,000 people lies between Kharkiv and Russian-held Izyum, a city with a major railway hub used by Moscow to supply its forces. Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Russian official with the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram on Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izyum would become vulnerable on their northwest flank. The Ukrainian armed forces concentrated mass fire on the mobile groups of the Donetsk People’s Republic, which had taken up defensive positions in nearby forests. At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire.” Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television, without giving locations, that a “counter-attack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss spoke with her Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pledge her “full backing” for Ukraine during a call on Tuesday. Truss reiterated the United Kingdom’s “steadfast support” for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy, a statement released by Downing Street read. In her first call with a counterpart since becoming prime minister, she reiterated to the Ukrainian leader that he had her full backing, and Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term. The leaders discussed the need to strengthen global security and the measures necessary to cut off the funds fuelling Putin’s war machine. The leaders deplored Putin’s attempts to weaponise energy, and the prime minister said it was vital Russia’s blackmail did not deter the west from ensuring Putin fails. She also underscored the importance of ensuring the UK and our allies continue to build energy independence.” Zelenskiy said he congratulated Truss on the appointment to her new role, saying he felt that the leaders “will be able to build a profound and productive relationship”. He added that he extended an invite to the new British prime minister to visit Ukraine. The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Secretary general António Guterres urged for the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. An agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he said. Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters ahead of the council meeting, “if we demilitarise then the Ukrainians will immediately step in and ruin the whole thing.” The UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant and confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. The IAEA said it was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Grossi said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released its findings from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Secretary general António Guterres urged for the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. “An agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he said. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters ahead of the council meeting, “if we demilitarise then the Ukrainians will immediately step in and ruin the whole thing.” Biden and newly appointed British prime minister, Liz Truss, have vowed to partner against Russia and show their “continued support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression” after speaking by phone on Tuesday. A Downing Street spokesperson said Truss reiterated to the Ukrainian leader that he had her full backing, and Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term,” while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he felt the two leaders “will be able to build a profound and productive relationship”. The UN nuclear watchdog said its experts found extensive damage at the plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant and confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Grossi said. A “parallel” counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and northeastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. “We are advancing and pressing almost along the entire frontline,” Oleksiy Arestovych said on Telegram late on Tuesday night. “In the coming months, we can expect the defeat of the Russian army in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant advance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the east.” Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Russian president Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials. “It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. “They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres … agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on.” US president Joe Biden’s administration has rejected calls from Ukraine to brand Russia a “state sponsor of terrorism,” saying it would have “unintended consequences” to Ukraine and the world. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the designation would hamper aid delivery to Ukraine or prevent aid groups and companies from participating in a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey to ship grain from Ukraine’s blockaded ports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Putin recycles old grievances on Victory Day Russia launched a fresh wave of drone, missile and airstrikes on cities across Ukraine this week, as Moscow stepped up attacks on the eve of its Victory Day parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany. A tumultuous year of fighting has passed since Vladimir Putin last addressed Russian soldiers on Red Square in Moscow to mark the country’s victory over the Nazis. But the Russian leader’s Victory Day message to the nation on Tuesday, made hours after more than a dozen Russian missiles were downed over Kyiv, was nearly identical to that of last year as he cast the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against an aggressive, Russophobic and woke west, writes Pjotr Sauer in his analysis of the celebrations. What was left unspoken by the Russian president was the battering his army has received over the past 12 months in Ukraine, which was revealed by the scaled-down military parade that followed his speech. The muted parade reflects a sense of unease after recent attacks on Russian soil, the Guardian writes in its editorial. Meanwhile, Russia is also becoming a cultural wasteland, writes William Fear. Ukraine needs more time before its counteroffensive Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine needs more time before it can launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russia, Luke Harding reported, adding that some armoured vehicles promised by the west have yet to arrive. The president said newly formed brigades were ready to attack. “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Zelenskiy’s comments in an interview with several media outlets including the BBC are the clearest sign yet that a major Ukrainian military push is unlikely to take place in the next few weeks. The Czech president, Petr Pavel, a decorated retired general who was previously Nato’s principal military adviser, privately warned Ukraine’s leadership against the disaster of a rushed counteroffensive, Daniel Boffey reported this week. Meanwhile, Peter Beaumont travelled to Kherson, where villages are preparing for the counteroffensive. UK will send long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine Britain has become the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in the counteroffensive, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response. Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding reported this story. Hours after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he needed more western weapons to be confident of a victory this summer, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, told MPs that the missiles – which cost more than £2m each – were “now going in, or are in the country itself”. The gift of the missiles was supported by the US, Wallace added, although previously Washington had declined to give Ukraine long-range missiles of its own, fearing that the outcome could escalate hostilities in the 15-month war. Zaporizhzhia plant facing ‘catastrophic’ staff shortage Russia plans to relocate about 2,700 Ukrainian staff from Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Ukraine’s atomic energy company has claimed, warning of a potential “catastrophic lack of qualified personnel” at the Zaporizhzhia facility in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. Workers who signed employment contracts with Russia’s nuclear agency Rosatom following Moscow’s capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant early in the war are set to be taken to Russia along with their families, Energoatom said in a Telegram post on Wednesday. Russian forces were also evacuating residents from the area near the plant, with more than 1,600 people, including 660 children, evacuated so far, a Moscow-installed official in the region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned last weekend that the situation around the plant had become “potentially dangerous”. Ukrainian soldiers struggle with post-traumatic stress Volodomyr Kucherenko’s problems with post-traumatic stress began not with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but eight years ago when the war began in the Donbas. In the midst of what was supposed to be a truce, he was resting with his unit, which included his brother-in-law, when they were mortared in the yard of a village house. Injured in the leg during the first strike, his brother-in-law threw himself over Kucherenko to protect him from shrapnel as more rounds came in. The wounds he sustained protecting his comrade would prove fatal. Kucherenko’s experience is far from unique, Peter Beaumont reports. After more than a year of brutal and continuing combat, Ukraine’s wounded – both physically and psychologically – have become an inescapable fact in a horrific war often fought at close quarters under shell fire. French journalist killed in Russian rocket strike in Ukraine A French journalist working for Agence France-Presse was killed in a Russian rocket strike near Bakhmut. Arman Soldin, a 32-year-old video coordinator, died on Monday when a Grad missile landed close to where he was lying, Luke Harding reported. Soldin was with Ukrainian soldiers in the town of Chasiv Yar, six miles (10km) from Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months. At least 11 journalists, fixers and drivers for media organisations have been killed covering the war in Ukraine, according to the group Reporters Without Borders. Risk of cyber-attack is main Eurovision worry, says BBC The risk of a cyber-attack is the “main worry” for broadcasters staging the Eurovision song contest on behalf of war-torn Ukraine, a BBC executive has said. Experts from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre have been drafted in to help thwart any attempts by pro-Russian hackers to sabotage the competition’s public vote on Saturday, Josh Halliday reports. Kate Phillips, the BBC’s director of unscripted programmes, said there was no specific intelligence about an attack but that there were “so many contingency plans” in place if it happened. Phillips said the contest would have had high security in any event but the war in Ukraine meant “we have had to up it as much as we possibly can”. Inside Ukraine’s most creative bomb shelter In the early days of February 2022, Kharkiv artist Mykola Kolomiets had no idea of the momentous and deadly events that were coming his way. “No one believed that the war was going to start,” says Kolomiets, sporting an orange woolly hat and an infectious grin, “even though we were warned by the experts. My girlfriend joked that the studio would make the perfect bomb shelter.” You can see why, Charlotte Higgins writes: the studio is a labyrinthine, subterranean series of interconnected rooms. What it lacks in natural light – I spot a single window, taped up against the possibility of shattering glass – it makes up for in colour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T16:11:00Z","webTitle":"Putin has gambled away gas leverage, says German vice-chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Putin has gambled away gas leverage, says German vice-chancellor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has gambled away his gas leverage over Europe, Germany’s vice-chancellor has claimed as he sounded a note of cautious optimism over his country’s energy supplies during a visit to Norway. Russia’s war in Ukraine had caught Berlin at a vulnerable moment since it was over-reliant on natural gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and had failed to build up infrastructure for alternative supply channels, said Robert Habeck, the German deputy head of government and economic minister. “The German problem, or the central European problem, was that half of our eggs were in the basket of Putin,” the Green politician said at a joint press conference with the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, in Oslo. “And he destroyed them.” At the start of 2023, however, Germany was “one-third done” being able to replace ceased Russian deliveries of gas, oil and coal through other channels, such as speedily built liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and an increase of imports from Norway, now Europe’s largest supplier of gas. Norway’s energy minister, Terje Aasland, announced on Thursday that Oslo would again be able to deliver 122bn cubic metres of natural gas to Europe this year, up 8% from deliveries in 2021. While emphasising that Germany’s energy situation remained “very very tight and complicated”, Habeck sounded a note of optimism. “Right now, I can say the storages in Germany are full, around 90%, we will withstand this winter, and the prices are going down.” With central Europe enjoying a relatively mild winter so far, he said, there was a “fair chance” its storage tanks would not be completely empty at the end of the cold season. Amid shortages of gas and fears of power outages, European neighbours have voiced incredulity with Germany sticking to its plan to phase out nuclear power – a decision made under the conservative chancellor Angela Merkel but massively pushed for by Habeck’s Greens. The minister for economic affairs and climate action again dismissed talk of further U-turns on Germany’s nuclear exit plans. His government’s focus was to scale up renewable electricity from about 46% to 80% by 2030, he said, adding: “I would advise everyone to focus on one plan and not disrupt everything again.” Since gas power plants formerly played a crucial role balancing out fluctuating power production from renewables, Germany will probably have to upgrade its grid and open up new storage options to comply with Habeck’s plan. The Green politician, who has proved fleet-footed in dancing around the ecological party’s old dogmas in his first year in power, suggested in Norway he would continue in a similar vein in 2023. In Oslo, Habeck and his Norwegian counterparts signed two declarations to cooperate more closely in areas including hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage (CCS) – two technologies that have in the past proved controversial with the German Greens’ party base. Habeck said while he had previously shared concerns around the safety of CCS – whereby carbon emissions are trapped in filters and then piped to storage locations underground – Norway’s experience with the technology had proven it was safe and efficient. “Better to put CO2 into the earth than into the air,” he said. CCS is banned in Germany, but the government of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has recently indicated it would look into putting the use of the technology back on the table. The hydrogen agreement between Oslo and Berlin foresees Norway providing Germany with “blue hydrogen”, which is low-carbon but not zero-emissions like green hydrogen, the latter being produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Environmentalists fear scaling up blue hydrogen imports could create new dependencies on fossil fuels. Habeck on Thursday described green hydrogen as “superior”, but added: “The only thing is, you need a sufficient amount of it,” and as long as production was insufficient, blue hydrogen was potentially a superior alternative to natural gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:51:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Russia moved ahead on Thursday with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has begun withdrawing its forces from the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and transferring its positions there to regular Russian troops, according to its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it described as the “complete lack of results” in an investigation to identify who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. Ukraine said on Thursday it had shot down all 36 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks which it claims likely targeted key infrastructure and military facilities. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations can reveal. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter. An entry in the Dutch land registry shows that the plot of land was seized on 12 May by the national public prosecutor’s office for financial, economic and environmental offences. The agency is responsible for enforcing sanctions compliance. Dutch cadastre documents show that the land plot was seized as part of a criminal investigation. You can read more of this exclusive, by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, here: America has long asked Ukraine not to use US-provided military equipment to carry out attacks inside Russian territory, Gen Mark Milley, the top US general, said on Thursday. Milley, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said his office was looking into imagery appearing to show vehicles allegedly used in an attack around the Russian border region of Belgorod. But he said the US position against such US equipment being used inside Russia was clear to Kyiv, Reuters reports. During talks held this week in Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence minister personally thanked Ben Wallace for the UK’s continued military support for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence has said. The UK defence secretary met his counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, after the UK provided Ukraine with long-range precision strike capability earlier this month. British sources have said giving Storm Shadow missiles was compatible with the UK’s signature to the voluntary missile technology control regime, which is intended to limit the proliferation of cruise missiles. Wallace said in comments released on Thursday: I was pleased to visit Kyiv again to meet with my good friend Oleksii Reznikov to discuss the next stages of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion. The UK continues to offer equipment, training and advice to Ukraine’s armed forces. I also visited some of the military commanders who have been so bravely pushing back Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two US strategic bomber planes away from the Russian border as they flew over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. “The crew of the Russian fighter aircraft identified the aerial targets as two US air force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said in a statement. The US aircraft did not cross the border and the fighter jets returned to their home airfield, it added. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Ukraine said on Thursday that it would open more embassies in Africa, as it announced its intention to stage a historic summit with leaders from the continent. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, made the comments in a statement to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). He said: We have recently adopted our first African strategy and intensified our political dialogue with many countries on the continent. This year, we are going to establish new embassies in different parts of the continent and plan to hold the first Ukraine-Africa Summit. I invite the leaders of your countries to take part in this important event. In a lower section, the address read: “We are hearing calls for peace from various countries and leaders. We support them as such and think they need to be directed first and foremost to Russia as the country that started this war.” Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, confirmed on Thursday that the relocation of some tactical nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russia signed a deal with its close ally Belarus earlier on Thursday about the storage of the warheads at a special facility that should be finished in just over a month’s time. It is unclear at this stage how many nuclear weapons would be kept in Belarus. Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, and have a relatively short range. Speaking in Moscow, Lukashenko said “the movement of the nuclear weapons has begun,” AP reports, but he was not clear whether any actually had arrived in his country. Lukashenko, who sparked rumours of being seriously ill when he cut short a Victory Day appearance in Red Square on 9 May before resurfacing in public on 15 May, was attending a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council with Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plan for the nuclear deployment, Moscow’s first outside Russia’s borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, was announced by Putin in an interview with state television on 25 March. The Russian president has said the west is fighting an escalating proxy war against Russia. The US government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds, AP reports. The Danish foreign ministry has confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned by Russia over the Nord Stream investigation (See 12:34), and said authorities in Denmark, Germany and Sweden were continuing their investigations, Reuters reports. “Denmark has been providing ongoing updates to Russia regarding the investigation’s progress and responding to their inquiries. We will continue to do so,” the ministry said in an email. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner has claimed his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and handing over control to the Russian military. Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts, Hanna Maliar, the deputy minister of defence, said. Russia and Belarus signed a deal formalising the procedure for deploying Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, AP reported. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after reports claimed that emergency services had been called to the building. Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said on Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. The European Commission has repeated calls for China to play a constructive role in establishing peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. “The EU expects China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role (...) and to recall the necessity to respect the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity (...) by unconditionally withdrawing all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the EU said in a statement on Thursday. Last week, Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement. He is set to visit Russia on Friday. Finland will provide Ukraine with additional military aid worth around €109m, with the package containing ammunition and anti-aircraft weapons, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, has been quoted by the Kyiv Post as saying. Finland is also among the European countries helping Ukraine defend itself on the battlefield, sending Leopard tanks to assist in combat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, for the military package, which he says is “urgently needed on the battlefield”. Zelenskiy tweeted: I thank Finland and President @niinisto personally for the prompt implementation of our agreements reached in Helsinki. The 16th package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which will include anti-aircraft systems and ammunition, is urgently needed on the battlefield. Together to victory! Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and adviser to Ukraine’s interior minitry, has shared an unverified clip that purports to show a drone attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs yesterday. Russia claimed on Wednesday it had repelled three unmanned vessels that attempted to strike the reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea, but the video appears to show that at least one of the drones got extremely close to the ship, even though it remains unclear if any damage was caused. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence issued this statement: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km north-east of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfil its tasks. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament has offered words of reconciliation over second world war-era mass murders that have strained relations with its neighbour and strategic ally Poland for 80 years. Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers that the two countries should work together to identify and honour Polish victims buried in Ukraine, sounding a new tone in contrast to the recent angry reaction of Ukraine’s ambassador to Polish expectations of an apology. About 100,000 Poles were massacred in 1943-44 by Ukrainian nationalists and others in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine. “Human life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,” Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers. “With this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.” Poland this year is marking the 80th anniversary of the 1943-44 massacre. Entire villages were burned down and all their inhabitants killed by the nationalists. Poland calls the events a genocide. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians died in retaliation. Associated Press reports Stefanchuk thanked the families of the victims for cultivating a memory that “does not call for revenge or hatred, but which serves as a warning that nothing like that can ever happen between our nations again”. He said identification and honoring of the victims “without bans or barriers” is “our joint moral and Christian obligation.” Poland’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Łukasz Jasina, had last week said that on the 80th anniversary Poland was expecting an apology from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Zvarych, reacted by saying that any suggestions of what Kyiv or Zelenskiy should do were “unacceptable and unfortunate”. Here are some of the latest pictures from Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner, claimed on Thursday that his forces had started pulling out of the city. Ukraine, which denies that Bakhmut has fallen to Russia, insisted it still controlled a “micro district” of the devastated city and said it was still advancing on the flanks, AFP reports. There has been an update on the reports of the alleged detention of two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia (See 06:56am): The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the saboteurs working for Ukrainian foreign intelligence had laid explosives on 11 pylons of the Leningrad and Kalinin nuclear power stations. “The plan of the Ukrainian special services was to prompt the shutdown of the nuclear reactors, disrupt the operation of the nuclear power plants and cause serious economic and reputation damage to the Russian Federation,” the FSB said in a statement. The attacks were due to take place on the eve of the 9 May anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, added the FSB, which said the saboteurs had been recruited in 2022 by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. These claims could not be independently verified. The Leningrad station, located on the Gulf of Finland close to St Petersburg, is Russia’s biggest atomic power plant. The Kalinin nuclear power station is 350km north of Moscow. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that Russia says it has captured, but where Kyiv’s forces claim they still have a small foothold, Reuters reports. “Every one of them is a hero of our state. Many of the ones we are returning from captivity were considered missing. The relatives of these people have gone through a difficult time,” said Andriy Yermak, the senior official. There was no immediate information available about the forces Russia received from Ukraine in exchange. Here is some more reporting on the exchange from The Kyiv Independent: Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year. In a statement, the ministry accused all three countries of trying to conceal who was behind the blasts, adding that it was unhappy about what it called the opaque nature of the investigation and its refusal to engage with Russia. According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives. The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries have said the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible. The two countries and Germany have been investigating the incident. Japan scrambled jet fighters after spotting Russian military planes over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan on Thursday, the defence ministry said. It detected one Russian information-gathering aircraft IL-20 flying round-trip from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific and another IL-20 flying toward the waters near Sado Island before turning toward the continent, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The EU agreed on Thursday to suspend restrictions on imports from Ukraine for a further year after warding off an import ban on grain imposed by some EU nations, Reuters reports. The Council of the EU, the grouping of EU governments, said in a tweet that EU ministers responsible for trade had agreed to the extension at a meeting on Thursday. The EU lifted tariffs and other restrictions for an initial 12 months in June 2022. In reaction to the news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for the “temporary liberalisation” to become permanent, as he continues to seek EU accession for Ukraine. He tweeted: As we move towards the EU, this temporary liberalization should become permanent – without any exceptions or restrictions. I am grateful to all EU members for their support, which brings us closer to the EU accession. Last month, EU governments agreed to extend the suspension of duties and quotas on imports from Ukraine by a year to help its economy during the war with Russia. Ukraine gained EU candidacy status in 2022 at record speed, but while it was an initial step to membership, the process usually takes many years to complete. In addition to Russia announcing on Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country (See 09:46), Moscow has additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September, Reuters reports. We reported earlier (See 10:27) that Russia is said to have replaced Wagner private military units with regular troops in the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian mining city that has been largely devastated by a year of deadly fighting. Reuters has new quotes from Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, who had an update after reports of Wagner forces withdrawing from the eastern Ukrainian city and handing over their positions to regular Russian troops. Maliar wrote in comments on the Telegram app: “In Bakhmut’s outskirts, the enemy has replaced Wagner units with regular army forces. Inside the city itself Wagner fighters remain.” She also said that Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts of the city. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, claimed that the number of Russian attacks in the area had fallen in the last three days, and that there had been two military engagements in the last 24 hours, though shelling continued. You can read more on the fighting raging in Bakhmut here: Unverified footage of drones being shot down over Kyiv last night has been posted by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. He tweeted: Another sleepless night for many of us. Another attack on Kyiv. We hold on, go to work in the morning, thankful to our air defense and all our friends who keep Ukraine in their hearts and bring our Victory closer. Russia unleashed a barrage of drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, but the city’s air defences shot all of them down, Ukrainian authorities claimed on Thursday. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. Yesterday he warned of a new revolution in Russia if leaders did not improve their handling of the war. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counter-offensive coming from Ukraine that would be marked by a single significant shift of gear. He wrote: “Once again about the counter-offensive. This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down 36 out of 36 Shahad drones launched into Ukraine by Russia overnight. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that some areas of Chernivtsi were left without power after lines were damaged by falling drone debris. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine” as the two countries signed an agreement on the positioning of nuclear weapons in Belarus. During a visit to Minsk Sergei Shoigu said “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Russia had always held Kyiv responsible, and that it didn’t really matter exactly which Ukrainian units were behind it. Podolyak on Thursday responded by saying Ukraine had nothing to do with the “strange and pointless” attack. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brink tweeted: “After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative.” Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Earlier today Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counteroffensive coming from Ukraine that would mark a significant shift of gear. He tweeted: Once again about the counteroffensive. Without further questions. 1. This is not a “single event” that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. 2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow. 3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive. However, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, notes: “Except, at some point, Ukrainian ground forces will need to attack with sufficient combat mass …” Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Yesterday, Julian Borger reported for the Guardian from Kyiv that Progozhin had said that 20,000 of its fighters have been killed in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. He also warned that Russia could face another revolution if its leadership does not improve its handling of the war. Prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war, with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said in an interview posted on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. “First the soldiers will stand up, and after that – their loved ones will rise up. There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.” Reuters reports Russian prosecutors have asked a court to recognise crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the Moscow region during the second world war as a genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union. Russia said on Thursday it would expel five Swedish diplomats in what it said was a retaliatory measure for Sweden’s “confrontational course” in relations with Russia. The Russian foreign ministry said it was responding to the expulsion of five of its diplomatic staff from Sweden last month, which it called an “openly hostile step”. Relations between the two countries have worsened since Sweden last year announced its intention to join Nato after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports the Russian statement said ties had “reached an unprecedented low”. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide said on Thursday that Ukraine had nothing to do with a “strange and pointless” drone attack on the Kremlin and played down the findings of two US media reports. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, told Reuters in a statement that Russia was trying to reduce arms supplies to Kyiv by playing on western fears of a possible escalation because of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed that a drone attack on the Kremlin this month was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brinktweeted: After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine”. Russia launched part of its full-scale invasion and failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian soil in February 2022, in what it termed a “special military operation”. In statements published on Telegram by Russia’s ministry of defence, Sergei Shoigu is quoted as saying his meetings with his Belarusian counterpart have become more regular, saying: This is especially important in the context of the rapid growth of tension, the destruction of the foundations of strategic stability and the unprecedented intensification of international confrontation. Everything possible is being done to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine, which is receiving all kinds of military support. The Republic of Belarus has been and remains our faithful ally and reliable partner. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson has said of reports in the New York Times that Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin that “it doesn’t make much difference which of the units of the Kyiv regime is behind it”. Reuters reports Dmitry Peskov told the media: “We immediately said that the Kyiv regime was behind this.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denied at the time that Ukraine was responsible. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Tass has more detail on the document signed today concerning arrangements for Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons. On Telegram it quotes Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu saying “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. It also reports Shoigu noted the measures implemented by Russia and Belarus “comply with all existing international legal obligations”. Tass writes: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 25 March that Russia, at the request of the Belarusian side, would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, as the US has long done on the territory of its allies. According to the head of the Russian state, on 1 July it is planned to complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the Iskander missile system, which can be a carrier of nuclear weapons, and has assisted in re-equipping Belarusian aircraft to be able to use special ammunition. Belarusian servicemen have undergone appropriate training in the Russian Federation. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has started withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video published on Thursday, Reuters reports. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. The defence ministers of Russia and Belarus on Thursday signed a document on the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. Separately, citing Russian media, Reuters reported that the Russia defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the west was waging an “undeclared war” against Russia and Belarus. Shoigu is in Minsk for a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the CSTO member states, which include Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia and Belarus, which are close allies over the conflict in Ukraine, agreed earlier this year to deploy part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal in Belarus. Russia launched its failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian territory last year. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on the overnight situation, writing on its official Telegram channel: At night, air defence forces destroyed 36 of the 36 ‘Shahed’ drones that Russia launched over Ukraine, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian military struck Tsyrkuny in the Kharkiv region. The S-300 missile hit the ground. A private house was damaged, there were no injuries. In the Chernivtsi region, two power lines were damaged as a result of the fall of the drone debris – part of the Dnipro district was cut off. Three residential buildings were damaged. Yesterday, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 83 times: four people were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted to Telegram to state that in the last 24 hours one person has been killed and six injured by Russian shelling in the region. He listed a number of locations where houses and infrastructure had been destroyed, including Horlivka, Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties, Reuters reports Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. It writes: US officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration. US intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation. The New York Times goes on to say: US officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorised the Kremlin drone attack is “low” but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved. The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the US – Ukraine’s biggest supplier of military equipment – uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame US officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine. American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Zelenskiy, officials said. At the time, Zelenskiy said “We didn’t attack Putin or Moscow”, as he addressed journalists during a visit to Helsinki. Russia’s FSB security service says it has detained two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency RIA. More on that story now: Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment,said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. Investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: A second fire, which appeared to be unrelated, broke out at a market in Akos, in the Moscow region on Wednesday evening. Russia’s emergency services said on Telegram that the fire had increased from 500 sq metres to 1,800 sq metres and had been localised. No victims were reported. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, saying: “The fire broke out in the building of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in the centre of Moscow.” They cited an unnamed government source and said “a fire broke out on one of the balconies.” Emergency services were on the scene, the source told Tass. Almost an hour later, the news agency published a second story saying: “The Ministry of Emergency Situations did not detect a fire in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation for Moscow told reporters on Thursday.” Both stories were still up on the website at 5am Thursday, Moscow time. Unverified video circulated on social media early on Thursday showing smoke emerging from the ministry building. In one video of the building seen by CNN, a woman could be heard saying: “The smell of burning is horrible.” Denis Kapustin, Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used US military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, but declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately not from the Western partners”, he said. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, spoke to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled the raid on the Belgorod region. Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as homegrown, internal Russian strife. Two groups operating in Ukraine – the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion - have claimed responsibility. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who introduced himself by his call-sign White Rex. “I cannot reveal those upcoming things, I cannot even reveal the direction. The ... border is pretty long. Yet again there will be a spot where things will get hot.” Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. Via AFP: Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram that Russia “again attacked Kyiv from the air”. “The attack was massive,” the statement added. “The enemy continues to use attack tactics in several waves, with intervals between groups of attacking drones.” He added that “all detected air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv were destroyed” by Ukrainian air defence systems. The attacks were carried out using Iranian-made Shahed drones, the statement added, citing preliminary information. Air alerts were also reported in the cities of Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. And Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital. Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Here are the other key developments: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. In Belgorod, nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iranians on Wednesday to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia. Iranian-made Shahed drones supplied to Moscow have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The simple question is this: what is your interest in being an accomplice to Russian terror?” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “What is the benefit to Iran of such cynical killing?” Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” The Russian private army Wagner lost 20,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, and a similar number of its regular troop. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. The European Union has discussed sending Ukraine the profits from €196.6bn of Russian assets that are stuck inside the plumbing of global financial markets, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T19:23:47Z","webTitle":"Reports EU set to suspend visa travel agreement with Russia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","fields":{"headline":"Reports EU set to suspend visa travel agreement with Russia – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week, The Financial Times reports.

It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban.` Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. But Ukrainian officials later said the hit resulted significant civilian damages: damaging nine multi-story buildings and 40 private homes. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. The United States today called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the United Nations. The 191 signatories review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty every five years, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. It is unclear if Russia will try to fill its increase in armed forces members by recruiting more volunteer “contract” soldiers or by lifting annual targets for conscriptions, British intelligence says. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing says that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. Two people were killed in Russian firing on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram. Concern persists about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Volodymyr Zelenskiy met today with representatives of his defence and security sector, his office said. The secret meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. They discussed the situation at the front and the needs of the Ukrainian forces. The United States today called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the United Nations.

But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. Vedant Patel, a deputy spokesman for the US state department, said in a statement that Moscow did this “in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe that is currently occupied by the Russian military. The latest draft text had expressed “grave concern” over military activities around Ukrainian power plants, including Zaporizhzhia, according to Agence France-Presse. Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused the other of shelling the plant, and its operator has warned of the risks of a radioactive leak. “For the Russian Federation to not accept such language in the face of overwhelming international consensus underscores the need for the United States and others to continue urging Russia to end its military activity near ZNPP and return control of the plant to Ukraine,” Patel said. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk oblast, said explosions were heard at an agricultural facility in Russian-occupied Svatove. This facility was used as a Russian military base. Russia claimed that its forces struck workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region last night, damaging a facility where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force were being repaired. Ukrainian officials said the strike caused much more civilian damage than the Russians would acknowledge. With energy prices continuing to skyrocket across Europe, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, today called on the EU to separate electricity prices from those of gas to keep them from rising further due to the war in Ukraine, saying “we can’t let Putin decide every day” the price of energy, Agence France-Presse is reporting. “Electricity prices must go down,” he said in a statement. “We have to stop this madness that is happening right now on energy markets.” Nehammer said he would raise the issue at an emergency meeting the bloc is due to hold on the issue. He said he has already discussed it with the leaders of Germany and the Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency. Last week, the year-ahead contract for German electricity reached €995 ($995) a MWh while the French equivalent surged past €1,100 – more than a tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In the UK, the Ofcom energy regulator said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from 1 October to an average of £3,549 a year. It is just after 6pm in Ukraine.

Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia. Reuters reports that the US computer firm – a key supplier of servers in Russia – has joined others in curtailing operations since Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. Dell suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia in February, saying it would monitor the situation to determine next steps.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops would “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall have secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members would be allowed to leave the country so long as they had permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russian forces had turned the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military military base, putting the whole continent at risk. He said on Twitter: For decades, nuclear safety has remained Ukraine’s top priority, especially given our tragic past. Russian invaders turned Zaporizhzhya NPP into a military base putting the entire continent at risk. Russian military must get out of the plant – they have nothing to do there! Russia and Ukraine have each traded accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant. As we reported earlier, Russia’s defence ministry claimed there was more Ukrainian shelling of the plant over the past two days. However, Ukrainian authorities said that Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the power plant overnight. Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram on Sunday that Russian forces struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, about a two-hour drive from the plant, and the town of Orikhiv further east, Reuters reports. Emma Graham-Harrison reports for us from Chernihiv: The woods outside Chernihiv were quiet in late August when Anatoliy Pavelko scrambled into a 10-metre bomb crater with a trowel and an icebox full of sample jars. He wanted to find out what the Russian FAB-250 bomb left behind when it carved this gaping hole into the ground in the spring. Four months earlier, the environmental lawyer was dug in on a frontline just a few kilometres away, shells crashing around him in the bitter fight to keep Russian forces out of Kyiv. Now he has taken temporary leave from his unit of volunteers and returned to Chernihiv for a more familiar battle on a different front in the war against Moscow. Russia’s invasion has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and destroyed homes and entire cities. It is also devastating Ukraine’s environment, an “ecocide” that activists worry is going largely unrecorded amid the broader national tragedy. Read more: Toxins in soil, blasted forests – Ukraine counts cost of Putin’s ‘ecocide’ Simon Tisdall writes for us today to argue that Putin is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him? “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. So wrote American author Henry David Thoreau in 1854. It’s a fate that is rapidly overtaking Vladimir Putin as he struggles to escape the disastrous trap he set for himself in Ukraine. Russia’s president keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected. He didn’t expect car bombs in Moscow and humiliating attacks on fortress Crimea, either. Least of all did Putin anticipate 80,000 Russian soldiers dead or wounded. Dying with them is his Peter the Great pipe dream of a “greater Russia”. Extinct already is his reputation as anything other than a killer and a crook. An endless military quagmire is not a scenario Putin can afford as slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? Read more here: Putin is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him? These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The Financial Times is reporting that the EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week. The plan to freeze the 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports. It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban. The FT reports: As a first step, ministers plan to give political support to suspending the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement at a two-day meeting in Prague that begins on Tuesday, three officials involved in the talks told the Financial Times. A senior EU official involved in the talks said: It is inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities, on our marinas. We have to send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable. Parts of the 2007 deal relating to free movement of government officials and businessmen were suspended in late February. A wider suspension would remove preferential treatment for Russians when applying for all EU visas, requiring more documents, making them more expensive and significantly increasing waiting times. The senior EU official added that deeper changes could be introduced by the end of the year: We are in an exceptional situation and it requires exceptional steps. We want to go beyond suspending the visa facilitation. Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. In an update on the conflict, Russia’s defence ministry said: The high-precision weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the city of Zaporozhye, on the territory of the Motor Sich plant, hit the production shops, in which the helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force were repaired. They also claimed that Ukrainian forces have been shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant over the past two days. As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia continue to accuse each other of shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear facility in what has become a dangerous flashpoint in the war amid concerns about the potential for a radiation leak. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv: Ukrainians are likely to experience the coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17 and 18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. “Heating season”, the period when the central heating is on, will come later and end earlier, said Vitrenko. The target depends on Ukraine’s international allies giving it the necessary funds to import 4bn cubic metres-worth of gas, as well as no wildcards playing out – such as Russia destroying gas infrastructure or further decreasing its gas supplies to Europe.

Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram. Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia. Reuters reports that the US computer firm – a key supplier of servers in Russia – has joined others in curtailing operations since Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. Dell suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia in February, saying it would monitor the situation to determine next steps. Concern persists about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops would “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall have secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members would be allowed to leave the country so long as they had permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. Around 46,750 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war with Ukraine, the country’s foreign ministry said on in an update posted on Twitter. The update added that Russia has also lost 3,171 vehicles and fuel tanks, 234 aircraft and 1,942 tanks, since the start of the conflict in February this year. Russia does not give a running total of troop losses or equipment destroyed or taken. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. Rustem Umerov, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, thanked the UK for supplying the country with underwater drones. A press release on Saturday from the Ministry of Defence said: Six autonomous minehunting vehicles will be sent to the country to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coast. Three of these will be provided from UK stocks, with a further three to be purchased from industry. The lightweight autonomous vehicle is designed for use in shallow coastal environments, operating effectively at depths of up to 100m to detect, locate and identify mines using an array of sensors so the Ukrainian Navy can destroy them. Dozens of Ukrainian Navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, with the first tranche having already begun their training. Dan Sabbagh reports for us from Kramatorsk: A Russian missile slammed into Valentina’s garden on a residential street in Kramatorsk at about 6pm on a warm August evening, landing among the squash and cabbages to the rear of the pensioner’s house, smashing windows, destroying the roof, scattering glass, tiles, bricks and rubble everywhere. Valentina, 75, was sitting outside under a grapevine, just about far enough from the blast to escape only with cuts and bruises, some all too visible on a visit to her ruined home five days later. But while the wounds will heal, the trauma will linger. “All my life I worked hard. Why? Why? What did I do?” Valentina cried as she surveyed the wreckage, with no apparent prospect of help with the necessary clear-up, too shocked to know what to do next. Perhaps it was time to relocate to relative safety elsewhere in Ukraine? “How can I go? I have nothing to go with,” she asked. Read more: ‘We were born here’: Ukrainians in frontline towns face painful choice The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree allowing Ukrainian passport holders who have entered Russia since Moscow’s offensive to live and work in the country indefinitely. Until now, Ukrainians could stay in Russia only for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. To stay longer or to work, special authorisation or a work permit was required. Agence France-Presse reports that the new measure allows Ukrainian citizens and people from Ukraine’s separatist eastern regions that Russia recognises as independent to work in Russia without a work permit and to live in the country “without a time limit”, according to the temporary decree published on Saturday. The decree also forbids the deportation of Ukrainian citizens, except for those released from prison or those deemed to pose a threat to Russia’s security. Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia. Reuters reports that the US computer firm – a key supplier of servers in Russia – has joined others in curtailing operations since Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. Dell suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia in February, saying it would monitor the situation to determine next steps. Dell spokesperson Mike Siemienas said on Saturday: In mid-August, we closed our offices and ceased all Russian operations. Russia’s industry ministry said on Friday that many of the researchers and engineers working for Dell in Russia had already been offered new jobs, after media reports saying the company was making a full exit. Miranda Bryant and Mark Townsend report: A “shocking” 50,000 Ukrainian refugees in the UK could be made homeless next year, the government has been warned, but ministers are refusing to offer a fresh package of support to offset the impending crisis. As the cost of living crisis bites and with no end in sight to the war with Russia, fears are mounting that the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme will unravel next month when refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative accommodation in place. Although Boris Johnson has framed the UK’s response to Russia’s invasion as a principled triumph, a number of organisations warn that a key response of his government to the conflict’s refugee crisis could prompt a “disastrous rise in homelessness”.

Identifying as a black Ukrainian, Eno says most of the ideas that have changed his life as a designer have come from tough times in Ukraine. As he waits to bring his machines from Kyiv, and works on new shows while navigating the unfamiliar Hungarian system, he is optimistic about the future, telling other Ukrainian refugees: ‘If we had the will to withstand the Russians we also have the willpower to move and forge ahead in life.’ Russia has lost “tens of thousands” of troops and it is not yet clear how they will seek to recruit more soldiers, the latest British intelligence update said. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing said that President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The briefing said that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. This is because Russia has lost tens of thousands of troops; very few new contract servicemen are being recruited; and conscripts are technically not obliged to serve outside of Russian territory. However it “remains unclear” how Russia will try to fill its increase in armed forces members, said the MoD. It could recruit more volunteer “contract” soldiers or lift annual targets for conscriptions, the update added. Two people were killed in Russian firing on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold.

We have not been able to independently verify these battlefield reports. Millions of tonnes of food from past harvests in Ukraine still need to be cleared to make room in silos for the next one, the United Nations coordinator for the grains agreement says. More than 1m tonnes of grains and other foods have been exported under the grains deal brokered by Turkey and the UN, Reuters reports. Amir Abdulla, the UN coordinator for the Black Sea grain initiative, said on Saturday that the deal “has started creating some space but much more grain needs to shift to make space for the new harvest”. Ukrainian and Russian forces continue to accuse each other of shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with Ukraine saying Russian forces fired on areas just across the river from the complex and Russia saying Ukrainian shells hit a building where nuclear fuel is stored. The claims on Saturday came amid continuing concerns about the potential for a radiation leak at Europe’s largest nuclear facility, Associated Press reports. The governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said Russian Grad missiles and artillery shells hit the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each 10km (six miles) across the Dnieper River from the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Ukrainian forces had fired on the plant from Marhanets. Seventeen Ukrainian shells hit the plant over the past day, he said, with four striking the roof of a building that stored nuclear fuel.

The hugely expensive and dangerous legacy of the UK’s 20th-century nuclear revolution amounts to 700,000 cubic metres of toxic waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses. Much of it is stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, which the Office for Nuclear Regulation says is one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. As yet, there is nowhere to safely and permanently deposit this waste. Nearly 50 years ago the solution of a deep geological disposal facility (GDF) was put forward, but decades later the UK is no nearer to building one. Experts say new nuclear facilities will only add to the problem of what to do with radioactive waste from nuclear energy and that the “back end” issue of the hazardous toxic waste from the technology must not be hidden. An assessment by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) says spent fuel from new nuclear reactors will be of such high temperatures it would need to stay on site for 140 years before it could be removed to a GDF, if one is ever built in the UK. The prime minister’s nuclear ambition, it is understood, rests with even more modern nuclear reactors, known as advanced modular reactors. But nuclear waste experts say no one knows how to deal with the waste from such reactors, because they are such a new technology. “It is essential to talk about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle when you are considering building new nuclear power stations,” said Claire Corkhill, a professor of nuclear material degradation at the University of Sheffield and a member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, an independent body that advises the government. “Whilst we have a plan to finally and safely deal with the waste, it is less certain how this will be applied to the modern nuclear reactors that the government are planning to roll out. “These are completely different to previous reactors and we are at a very early stage of understanding how to deal with the waste. In my personal view, I do not think we should be building any new nuclear reactors until we have a geological disposal facility available.” The cost of decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s has risen to £131bn, according to the latest NDA annual report. This is likely to rise further as the costs of building a deep geological disposal site rise to up to £53bn. Attempts to build an underground dump for nuclear waste have so far failed. Nine years ago an attempt to site one in Cumbria was rejected. A new attempt to find a site is in its early stages. Three sites in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire are being examined. If it goes ahead, it could be years before building starts, and the GDF would only be available to receive waste from the late 2040s. “The amount of legacy waste is not small in terms of nuclear waste,” said Corkhill. “It is expensive to deal with. These materials are hazardous and we are looking at an underground footprint of some 20km at a depth of 200 metres to 1,000 metres. So regarding new nuclear sites, we need to think about whether it is possible to build a GDF big enough for all the legacy waste and the new nuclear waste.” The power stations that need decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Waste from more recent nuclear facilities including Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and Sizewell C, which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited in a GDF. It is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new nuclear reactors. Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: “Despite 65 years of using nuclear power in Britain, we are still, at best, decades away from having facilities to safely dispose of the waste. Until we know this can be done, it is premature to embark on a major new programme of nuclear power plants.” NDA documents show that as of 2019, the volume of nuclear waste that needs to be permanently disposed of in a deep GDF is 773,000 cubic metres. Of that waste, 10% is from new nuclear facilities, while the rest is legacy waste. A government spokesperson said: “This is not an either/or situation. As the prime minister has said, nuclear will be a key part of our upcoming energy security strategy alongside renewables. We are committed to scaling up our nuclear electricity generation capacity, and building more nuclear power here in the UK, as seen through the construction of Hinkley Point C – the first new nuclear power station in a generation. “Alongside this we’re developing a GDF to support the decommissioning of the UK’s older nuclear facilities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T01:10:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 256 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 256 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian troops have been looting Kherson ahead of a potential withdrawal from the south-eastern Ukrainian city. Items taken range from art and cultural exhibits to ambulances and tractors. There has been an assassination attempt on a judge who sentenced two Britons to death in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Alexander Nikulin, who said Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner should be shot by a firing squad, was shot in Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, on Friday night. The local supreme court justice is in a serious condition in hospital. Russian troops are allegedly searching for residents in the Kherson region who are refusing to evacuate, before the forces’ potential withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has claimed its forces killed another 600 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has said the country did supply Russia with drones but that it took place before President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Kyiv. The drones have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed talk of limited Iranian supplies to Russia, saying Kyiv had downed 11 drones on Friday alone. He said: “If Iran continues to lie about the obvious, it means the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia pays Iran for such cooperation.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Iran “should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine will be much larger than the benefits of Russia’s support”. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he does not believe Russia will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The 300,000 troops Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability” as the Russian military is struggling to train them, UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported. Scheduled power cuts will take place on Sunday in seven Ukrainian provinces including major cities such as Kyiv. Other provinces affected are Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Poltava. About 500 power generators have been sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries to help with the energy problems caused by Russian attacks. At least 112,000 Russians have emigrated to Georgia this year, border crossing statistics show. Reuters reported that the first large wave of 43,000 arrived after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February and the second wave came after Putin announced a nationwide mobilisation drive in late September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T21:35:18Z","webTitle":"Russia steps up Ukraine ‘dirty bomb’ claim in letter delivered to UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","fields":{"headline":"Russia steps up Ukraine ‘dirty bomb’ claim in letter delivered to UN","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia has stepped up its nuclear propaganda and delivered a letter to the United Nations claiming that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a “dirty bomb” on its territory, an allegation dismissed by Kyiv, western governments and weapons experts as absurd and an attempt at distraction or pretext for Moscow’s own escalation. The letter was addressed to the UN secretary general and the Gabonese ambassador, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the security council, and follows calls by Russia’s defence minister to foreign ministers in recent days making similar unfounded allegations. At the same time, Russia circulated a 310-page document in the security council, repeating earlier debunked claims that Ukraine and its western backers had been working on a bioweapon. Asked about the Russian claims on Tuesday, US president Joe Biden said: “I spent a lot of time today talking about that.” The letter was delivered at a time when Russia is still suffering battlefield losses in Ukraine and anxious to reverse the momentum. Nato has entered its second week of annual drills rehearsing for nuclear war, and Russia is expected to launch its own annual exercises this week. The Russian UN letter presented no evidence for Moscow’s claim that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a dirty bomb, an explosive device designed to disperse radioactive materials over an area to render it at least temporarily uninhabitable. Instead, it lists all the possible sources of radioactive isotopes to which Ukraine could conceivably have access, but makes several mistakes, suggesting whoever drafted the letter had no grasp of the science involved, experts said. Ukraine’s uranium mines are listed as one possible source for material for a dirty bomb, but natural uranium ore would be useless for such a purpose. “You can’t make a dirty bomb with uranium ore. It’s a bunch of rock that contains tiny inclusions of uranium 99% of which only a tiny bit is radioactive. Only long-term sustained exposure can result in harm to humans,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a senior research associate at the project on managing the atom at the Harvard Kennedy school’s Belfer Center. Other sources of radioactive material the letter mentioned were spent fuel at the Chornobyl nuclear plant, but that has been cooling for decades and would not do much harm. Other sites it listed with potentially more toxic material are sealed and monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), so any diversion would be spotted and flagged. The letter also claimed Kyiv intended the bomb to be a false-flag operation, in which the Ukrainians would claim it was a Russian low-yield nuclear weapon containing highly enriched uranium, which would be detected in the atmosphere. But the traces left by a dirty bomb would be completely different from a real nuclear weapon, which would leave behind products of nuclear fission. “There is no world in which dispersed spent nuclear fuel or some kind of radioactive material from research facilities could be mistaken for, or misrepresented as, byproducts of a nuclear fission reaction,” Budjeryn said. “It is just elementary physics.” The Russian letter also pointed to another “heinous scenario” supposedly plotted by Kyiv, to sabotage a nuclear power plant under its control or shell the Zaporizhzhia plant under Russian occupation. But again it offered no evidence why Ukraine would carry out an act of such significant self-harm. The flimsiness of the claims led some diplomats and experts to suspect it was not intended to convince anyone but to send a message, but it is unclear what that message may be. One possibility is that it is meant to look like a cover for Russia’s own plans to use such a device in the latest of a long series of efforts to deter Ukraine’s backers from continuing their support. Another option is that it is simply a distraction from Russia’s continuing military setbacks in Ukraine, intended principally for domestic consumption. “I guess because they need something to sell to Russian media when they are pushed out of Kherson,” one western diplomat at the UN suggested. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia’s accusation was a sign that Moscow – which has threatened to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine – was planning such an attack and preparing to shift the blame to Ukraine. In Washington on Tuesday Biden said: “Russia would be making an incredible, serious mistake if it were to use a tactical nuclear weapon.” Asked about the Russian dirty bomb claims, he replied: “I’m not guaranteeing that it’s a false flag operation yet. Don’t know, but it would be a serious mistake, a very serious mistake.” The Kyiv government has asked the IAEA to verify that no radioactive materials in Ukraine have gone missing, and the UN nuclear watchdog said it was preparing to send inspectors to two unidentified Ukrainian sites, both already subject to frequent inspections. At the same time, the Ukrainian nuclear power authority, Energoatom, reported that Russian occupying forces were carrying out secret construction work within the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Energoatom said it believed the Russians “are preparing a terrorist act using nuclear materials and radioactive waste” stored at the plant compound. The Russian allegations come amid reports suggesting Russian forces and Wagner mercenaries had suffered heavy losses in recent days in fighting in the key Donbas city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of four months of ferocious Russian efforts to advance there with little to show for the effort. The flurry of Russian accusations has been met with deep scepticism in the west with analysts pointing to Moscow’s history of false allegations – including its characterisation of Ukraine as a “neo-Nazi” regime – to justify its own aggression. France, Britain and the US said the allegations were “transparently false” and Washington warned Russia there would be “severe consequences” if Russia used any nuclear material, while saying there were no signs of that yet. “There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a dirty bomb or a nuclear bomb,” said the state department spokesperson, Ned Price. Perhaps significantly, the Russian allegation has prompted rare communication with the west, with Moscow’s armed forces chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, speaking on Monday to his US counterpart, Mark Milley, for the first time since May. Early on Tuesday, Ukraine’s army chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said he too had spoken to Milley. Most analysts believe there is little chance a false-flag dirty bomb attack could really be used as a pretext for a nuclear detonation. “If this was a false-flag event, we would know it instantly, nobody would blame Ukraine,” said William Alberque, an arms control expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Radiological weapons are so identifiable, so scrutinised. You can make a chemical weapon from scratch,” but “nuclear material has a fingerprint” based on the facilities used to create it, he told AFP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-10T05:42:05Z","webTitle":"Queensland LNP pledges net zero 2050 target at next election amid ‘deeply troubling’ rise in emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Queensland LNP pledges net zero 2050 target at next election amid ‘deeply troubling’ rise in emissions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Queensland’s opposition has announced it will bring a net zero emissions target by 2050 to the next state election at the LNP’s annual convention in Brisbane over the weekend.

How do we make sure that we don’t just talk about targets that we actually achieve energy reduction?” The announcement drew immediate criticism from environmentalists and the Queensland Greens who argued the target did not go far enough. “Our emissions targets should be based on the science, not political manoeuvring,” Dave Copeman, director of the Queensland Conservation Council, said. “I hope the next LNP emissions reduction policy is in line with climate science necessary to keep warming to 1.5 degrees.” Copeman welcomed the LNP’s support of Labor’s policy on coal royalties but criticised the party’s consideration of nuclear power at the annual conference. “Regrettably senior LNP leaders continuing to raise the distraction of nuclear power, suggests they are still looking for soundbites, not science-based solutions,” he said. “Solar, wind and storage are the proven technology that provides cheaper, cleaner power … If we continue the climate wars, we risk missing out of the investment and future-proof jobs that the renewables transformation will create.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning South Brisbane MP Amy MacMahon tweeted that the Palaszczuk government and Queensland opposition now have the same net zero target by 2050. “It’s not science-based. And on our current trajectory, we’re not going to meet even this,” she said on Sunday. The Palaszczuk government last year accused the LNP of “crab walking” towards climate action and attempting to “cobble something together” in the lead-up to the federal election. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the Liberals have backed a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In Western Australia, the Liberals have promised zero emissions by 2030. While the federal Liberals support a target of net zero emissions by 2045. The Queensland state government took their net zero emissions target by 2050 to the state election in 2020, alongside its existing 2030 target to cut emissions from 2005 levels by 30%. In response, the LNP said it would scrap both the interim target and the net zero target by 2050 and instead align the state to the federal government’s targets. The Coalition did not have a net zero target at the time but had committed to an emissions reduction of 26–28% below 2005 levels by 2030. “Unlike Labor who have promised change to only go backwards, the LNP will work with the private sector, energy market institutions, households and businesses as we transition towards a sustainable energy future,” Crisafulli said when he was the environment spokesperson. “To increase the amount of renewable energy, the LNP will fast-track approvals for major projects, including renewable energy projects to reduce power bills and create more green jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T06:14:32Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong hits back at China’s claim Aukus nuclear submarines will fuel an arms race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","fields":{"headline":"Penny Wong hits back at China’s claim Aukus nuclear submarines will fuel an arms race","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit back at China’s response to Aukus, insisting that its criticisms of the nuclear-powered submarine deal are “not grounded in fact”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions. After the announcement of a multi-decade plan that could cost as much as $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, Wong said no rational observer could conclude Australia was the source of a regional arms race. She urged China to take up a US offer to agree on “guardrails” to avoid an outbreak of war, despite the concept being derided by Beijing last week. Australia has previously accused China of lacking transparency about its own rapid military buildup. “Nobody wants to see escalation. Nobody wants to see a miscalculation,” Wong said on Tuesday. “I think the region is entitled to seek that the great powers manage competition respectfully and appropriately.” Hours after the Aukus plans were announced by the US, the UK and Australia on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry repeated its longstanding position that the deal reflected “a typical Cold War mentality” that would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN also denounced the “irony” that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. When asked about that comment, Wong said: “That response is not grounded in fact.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. She also said “a number of other countries have” nuclear-powered submarines – and they were allowed under the NPT. “Australia’s motivation is peace,” she said. Observers say the Aukus arrangement is novel, because it would be the first time that fissile material and nuclear technology had been transferred from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the Australian government is believed to disagree with this being characterised as a “loophole”, and it has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the program. Wong vowed to continue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in place “the highest quality arrangement … to ensure this material is managed in a way that is consistent with the NPT”. The UK and the US say they will provide Australia with nuclear material in “complete, welded nuclear power units that will not require refuelling” during the more than 30-year lifetime of the submarines. In a fact sheet issued on Tuesday, the Australian government added: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” The government has, however, promised to store the nuclear waste in Australia in a location yet to be decided. In recent weeks, Australian ministers and officials have paved the way for the Aukus announcement in a series of calls and meetings with counterparts across the Indo-Pacific. But ambassadors in Canberra are expected to be briefed in detail over the coming days. Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing on Monday to offer a briefing. Wong said the government had put in place “a comprehensive strategy” leading up to the announcement and made it a priority to re-engage with the Pacific and south-east Asia “in a very focused way”. The Aukus plan would give Australia “a greater capability of contributing to that strategic equilibrium which is necessary for the sort of region we all want to live in”. “Certainly it gives Australia a capability that very few countries have and that comes with responsibilities, which we are very aware of,” Wong said, adding that the plans would not undercut diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. “Our focus and our attention should be on averting conflict, on keeping the region stable, peaceful and prosperous, and ensuring that sovereignty can be protected.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the best way to reassure the region would be for Australia to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Indonesia – which joined with Malaysia to raise strong concerns about Aukus after it was first announced in 2021 – responded more cautiously on Tuesday. The Indonesian foreign ministry said it was the responsibility of all countries to maintain peace and stability in the region, and it expected Australia to develop “a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. On the eve of the announcement, China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper quoted Chinese analysts as claiming Australia was “planting a time bomb” and would bear the cost of its “expensive mistake”. But the incoming Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said last week Aukus should be seen in the context of China’s own push to build the world’s largest navy. China currently operates 56 submarines, of which 12 are nuclear-powered, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. Australia plans to buy at least three and as many as five Virginia-class submarines from the US in 2030s. The first Australian-built submarines, based on a yet-to-be-completed British design, should enter into service in the 2040s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:38:25Z","webTitle":"German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","fields":{"headline":"German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said he is working as fast as he can to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies, as pressure mounts on his government to come up with solutions to tackle a looming crisis. On the first day of a three-day visit to Montreal, Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, on Monday. “Canada plays a really, really central role for the development of green hydrogen,” Scholz said. “That’s why we are very glad to be able to expand our cooperation in this area on this occasion too.” The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany, but Trudeau downplayed the likelihood of a separate agreement on direct exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), due to logistical constraints and costs. “There are a number of potential projects that are in the books for which there has never been a strong business case,” Trudeau said. “It needs to make sense for Germany to import LNG from the east coast.” Scholz thanked Canada for allowing the export – despite sanctions on Moscow – of a refurbished turbine that Russia said it needed to continue providing natural gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The fact Russia has yet to request the needed turbine, which is currently in Germany, showed the Russian claims about technical issues hampering gas supplies to Russia were a ruse, he said. “Russia is no longer a reliable business partner,” Scholz said. “It has reduced gas deliveries everywhere in Europe, always referring to technical reasons that never existed. And that’s why it’s important not to walk into [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s trap.” The visit is taking place amid a heated debate in Germany triggered by growing concerns that Russia may completely close down its already considerably reduced gas flows to the country. The government faces pressure to prolong the life of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations, which are due to go offline by the end of the year as part of a withdrawal strategy announced in 2011. In recent days there have even been calls for it to reinstate the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, which was mothballed by the German government as a reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Scholz said at the weekend a decision on the nuclear power plants would probably be made in the coming days. But Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice-chancellor and economy minister and the leading Green, stressed this would only help to decrease gas consumption by about 2% and said “for the little it would bring us, it’s the wrong decision”. The government has dismissed out of hand the idea of resurrecting the defunct Nord Stream 2 project, repeatedly referring to the idea as “morally reprehensible”. But the fact it has been brought up at all illustrates the extent to which the pressure is growing on Scholz to come up with workable strategies to cope with the unprecedented situation, which threatens to plunge the German economy into recession and leave millions facing soaring energy bills and freezing homes. The deals struck with Canada will do little to help Germany in the near future, with this winter and next expected to be beset by an energy shortage and record prices. The head of the intelligence service has warned of the dangers of unrest from a radicalised minority consisting of rightwing extremists and conspiracy theorists, which he said were planning to exploit the situation. Leading economists have warned that rising energy bills on top of other living cost hikes will push increasing numbers of Germans into poverty and could trigger social unrest. Against this backdrop the government is keen to stress that once the infrastructure is in place to support hydrogen and LNG Germany will be on a safer footing. The optics of Scholz and Habeck landing in Montreal with their delegation are seen as sending an important immediate message to German voters that the government is taking action. In recent months it has often come across as stunned into stasis as it reeled from the shock realisation that Europe’s largest economy had made itself dangerously dependent on a single energy source in its pursuit of a green transition. Ahead of the visit, Habeck said Germany was “staring in the face of a very critical winter”. Habeck told German TV that the rapid filling up of national gas storage facilities – which are currently at just under 80% capacity – was encouraging, but warned that Russia could yet further reduce the flow and there was therefore no room for complacency. At present only about 20% of the levels of gas due via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline are reaching Germany."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-04T02:22:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 346 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 346 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United States has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.2bn (£1.8bn) which will include precision-guided rockets and Hawk air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the ground launched small diameter bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with European Union leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, Ukraine’s president said the country would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies were “quickened, specifically long-range weapons”. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the Samp/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. The EU has promised that a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth €10bn (£8.9bn/$10.8bn) and “hit the trade and technology that supports [Russia’s] war against Ukraine”. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as Zelenskiy hosted the EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-a-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. An American medic has been killed while working on the frontlines in Ukraine, just weeks after arriving in the country. Pete Reed, 34, was killed on Thursday while he was helping evacuate civilians when his vehicle was reportedly hit by a missile in Bakhmut. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed, saying de-mining was “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery would be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz’s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany’s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003. Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T16:35:02Z","webTitle":"Who will fund Sizewell C nuclear plant and when will it be built? | explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Who will fund Sizewell C nuclear plant and when will it be built?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is poised to sign off as prime minister by giving the green light for a new nuclear reactor costing up to £30bn. The decision to offer funding for the Sizewell C in Suffolk, in his final week in Downing Street, is expected to unlock significant private funding for the project after years bogged down in planning approvals. However, it would come after Johnson promised not to make any major spending decisions before leaving office. Here is the state of play. What is Sizewell C? The power station is planned to sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast. When complete, it is estimated the 3.2 gigawatt plant will be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. Sizewell C is expected to plug a gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities – most UK plants will be shut by 2030. Sizewell B is due to close in 2035, although its lifetime may be extended. How is it going to be funded? The plans were originally developed by France’s EDF, which holds an 80% stake in the project, and the Chinese state-backed nuclear power company CGN, which has a 20% holding. However, ministers are keen to avoid further Chinese involvement in UK nuclear sites amid worsening relations between Britain and China. CGN holds a stake in Hinkley Point C – the delayed and over-budget Somerset plant upon which plans for Sizewell are based. The UK government and EDF are expected to each take a 20% stake, while bankers at Barclays have been tasked by officials with finding investors for the remainder. Pension and infrastructure specialist funds are seen as the most probable candidates to invest. How much will it cost? Estimates have crept up from £20bn to a current range of £20bn to £30bn. The government will make a final decision on how much taxpayer funds will be put in – thought to be around £6bn – next year. Ministers have already committed £100m to the project and plan to use a so-called “regulated asset base” funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk to encourage their involvement in vital infrastructure deals. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has estimated that taxpayer backing will add an extra £1 a month to household bills. However, research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. The average estimate in the study put the combined cost at £35bn, or £2.3bn a year. When will it be built? The site is a crucial pillar in Johnson’s plan to green-light eight new nuclear reactors over the next eight years. However, the approval process has suffered multiple delays. The progress of Hinkley Point C – which earlier this year pushed back its opening to June 2027, a decade later than planned – has not provided an encouraging blueprint. The University of Greenwich forecasts predict it will take 15 years to build Sizewell C, or 17 years under its gloomiest forecast, and cost £43.8bn. Greg Clark, the levelling up secretary, this week unveiled proposals designed to speed up the approval of nuclear power stations and off-shore windfarms. The fast-track process will also be applied to major roads and airport runways. What are the objections against Sizewell C? The project has faced opposition on several fronts from critics who say nuclear projects are too slow to build and costly, as well as those concerned over safety and nuclear waste. Campaigners question the track record of the pressurised water reactor proposed for the site and the cost to consumers. Opponents also worry whether local infrastructure is capable of handling a site that could bring 6,000 workers to the area and thousands of extra vehicles. The threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed and risk of coastal erosion and flooding have also been raised. What happens next? A final decision is expected from the government on the project next year. With Johnson’s decision before his departure, the situation has echoes of Hinkley Point C, when Theresa May put the project on hold in 2016 in her first weeks as prime minister amid security concerns. May eventually approved the project and, if Liz Truss is successful in the Tory leadership race, her rumoured chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to be supportive of Sizewell C. However, the process may also be held up by a legal challenge by the Together Against Sizewell C campaign, over planning consent for the plant, which was given against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T18:10:41Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel awarded Germany’s top order of merit despite criticism of legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel awarded Germany’s top order of merit despite criticism of legacy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germany’s former leader Angela Merkel has been awarded the country’s highest order of merit despite criticism over her legacy, receiving praise for her discipline and passion during 16 years as chancellor. She was presented with the honour by the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in Berlin on Monday evening in recognition of her contribution to German political life at an event attended by her political allies, including the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the former national football coach Jürgen Klinsmann, Ulrich Matthes, an award-winning actor who had helped improve how she delivered speeches, as well as family and friends. The Großkreuz, or “large cross”, is the most important order of its kind. It has been received by two previous chancellors: Konrad Adenauer in 1954 and Helmut Kohl in 1998. Paying tribute to Merkel, Steinmeier, who served in her government as foreign minister, praised her “enormous stamina, tremendous amount of self-discipline” in steering Germany, from 2005 to 2021, including through the pandemic, and the crises over eurozone debt and refugees. He also referred to her attempts to prevent Russian aggression after the annexation of Crimea. Steinmeier said Merkel stood out as Germany’s first female chancellor and as a citizen from the communist East Germany in a male-dominated party who had succeeded in politics. She achieved this despite having “no role model, no old boys’ network to guide” her through the “political undergrowth”, he said, adding: “Your mainly male adversaries often struggling to read you.” Merkel looked on, often biting or pursing her lips nervously and only occasionally smiling, appearing uncomfortable at the praise being heaped on her and having to recall some of the events mentioned. She could not have avoided the criticism surrounding the event. But some commentators and opponents said the award had come too close to the end of Merkel’s 16-year chancellorship to allow an assessment of her legacy. Others have called it problematic that her actions arguably contributed to the problems Germany – and Europe – is now facing. Merkel’s decisions to withdraw Germany from nuclear power and to try to forge a working relationship with Moscow including encouraging energy dependency on it – now seen by most Germans as a huge mistake – are both under heavy scrutiny given Russia’s war against Ukraine. Allies of Merkel have defended her record, pointing out her attempts to keep Germany and Europe on an even keel during a period of considerable upheaval. Accepting the award, Merkel, fighting the effects of a cold to which she briefly referred, thanked those she said had supported her during her time in office, individually naming those she had personally invited, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, Neil MacGregor, the British art historian and former museum director who she said had helped broaden her cultural horizons at a time when she was forced to be tunnel visioned about life. Merkel also thanked Klinsmann, who had unexpectedly ignited her interest in football as coach of the German national team. “He doesn’t really fit into today’s concept, because I’m not particularly sporty,” she said to laughter, but added that she had “never let him out” of her sight and that he was the person who showed her what it was “possible to achieve”. She also paid tribute to her husband, Joachim Sauer, a leading German quantum chemist whose passion for his field had “sometimes helped him I believe” to endure the daily strain of his wife’s job over 16 years. Before the ceremony at Berlin’s Bellevue Palace, Steinmeier had come under particular criticism and faced accusations he was trying to save his reputation, which was tarnished over the close ties he sought with Russian politicians, including Sergei Lavrov, his then counterpart in Moscow, when he served as foreign minister under Merkel. Some of the sharpest criticism in the run-up to the ceremony came from within the ranks of Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Carsten Linnemann, the deputy chair of the CDU, told German breakfast television that while it was clear Merkel had contributed greatly to Germany, “especially internationally”, she had also “made mistakes, even flagrant ones”. In particular he cited her decision to withdraw Germany from nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster of 2011 as “a mistake in the way it was carried out”, because he said there had been little thought as to how it could be achieved. “There was no thought as to how exactly we wanted to reasonably become self-sufficient regarding our energy supplies,” he said, in reference to Germany’s dependence on Russian gas and lack of adequately developed alternative energy supplies. Linnemann also called Merkel’s refugee politics a “blatant failure”, because, he said, “we did not protect the borders, which is something that needs to be discussed as openly as the positive aspects”. Criticism also came from within the leadership ranks of the pro-business Free Democratic party and the far-left Die Linke. In contrast, the party leaders of her effective rivals the Social Democrats and the Greens, Saskia Esken and Omid Nouripour, voiced their praise for her and their support for the decision to reward her. Esken told the news portal RND: “In particular I value her diplomatic skill and her empathic wisdom with which she repeatedly managed to forge viable coalitions and compromises on the national as well as the international stage.” Nouripour said Merkel had shaped Germany “like only few others have done”. He said it was not necessary “to be in agreement with everything she did in order to recognise her great service”. Merkel has rarely been seen in public since her time in office ended in December 2021. Last year she condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine but emphasised her diplomatic efforts to avert the conflict, saying “I therefore will not apologise”, when asked if she would do so. She is writing a book about her time in office with her longstanding adviser, Beate Baumann, which is due for publication in autumn 2024 simultaneously in Germany, North America and the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T17:17:27Z","webTitle":" Russia launches six hypersonic missiles in massive barrage against Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","fields":{"headline":" Russia launches six hypersonic missiles in massive barrage against Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia launched six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences in the early hours of Thursday morning as it unleashed its largest missile barrage against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. At least six people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 440 miles (700km) from the frontline, according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. In the capital, Kyiv, the seven-hour alert through the night was the longest of Russia’s five-month air campaign. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. For much of Thursday the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – was forced to rely on diesel-powered generators after Ukrainian authorities said missile attacks had damaged power lines. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the frontline and both sides have warned of a potential for nuclear accidents there caused by fighting. The power grid operator Ukrenergo said in the afternoon that the power supply had been restored and the plant was switching away from generators. Russian-installed officials called the temporary cutoff a Ukrainian provocation. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, urged again for a protection zone around the plant. “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,” he told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation board of governors. Ukraine’s air force said the attack comprised, in total, “81 missiles of various types”, launched from Russian aircraft and carriers in the Black Sea. Defence forces destroyed 34 cruise missiles and four drones, it added. “Unfortunately, a missile of the Kinzhal type hit an infrastructure object,” said Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv region’s military administration. The military administration said 40% of people in the capital were without heating on Thursday morning. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the Holosiivskyi district, and two people were wounded in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Smoke could be seen rising from a facility in Holosiivskyi and police cordoned off all roads leading to it. The governor of Odesa region said a mass missile attack hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also struck. Kharkiv was left without electricity as a result of the overnight attack, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn and an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. Multiple settlements were shelled on Wednesday, damaging houses and commercial buildings, he added. Other blasts were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said the strikes were in response to what Moscow called a terrorist attack in Bryansk region last week, when members of a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps staged an incursion from Ukraine. Russia said two civilians were killed in the incident, which Ukraine accused Moscow of staging as a false “provocation”. The missile barrage came after Ukraine’s military said late on Wednesday it had managed to push back intense Russian attacks on the city of Bakhmut, despite a Russian claim of control over its eastern half. As one of the bloodiest battles of the year-long war ground on in the small city’s ruins, Ukrainian defenders – who last week appeared to be preparing for a tactical retreat – remained defiant. “The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a letup in storming the city of Bakhmut,” the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. “Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.” The battle for Bakhmut, which is still under Kyiv’s control, has raged for seven months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of buildings collapsed or charred. The few remaining civilians have been confined to basements for months with no running water, electricity or gas. Ukrainian military and political leaders now speak of hanging on to positions and inflicting as many casualties as possible on the Russians to grind down their fighting capability. Despite rumours of an imminent retreat of his troops, Zelenskiy said during an address on Wednesday evening that he had instructed the Ukrainian army to find forces to bolster the defence of the city. “I told the chief of staff to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said the battle for Bakhmut and the surrounding Donbas region was “our first priority”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T11:49:42Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog to head mission to Chernobyl as Russians withdraw from site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","fields":{"headline":"UN nuclear watchdog to head mission to Chernobyl as Russians withdraw from site","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The head of the UN atomic watchdog has said he aims to lead a mission to Chernobyl as soon as possible, after Russian troops were reported to have largely withdrawn from the decommissioned nuclear power station. Rafael Grossi tweeted on Friday that he would head an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) “assistance and support” mission to the highly contaminated site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in the first of a series of such visits to Ukrainian nuclear plants. The announcement came after Ukrainian officials said the Russian soldiers who had occupied the highly contaminated plant since 24 February – the first day of the invasion – had left taking several Ukrainian service personnel with them. Some Russians remained in the surrounding exclusion zone, they said. The Ukrainian state power company Energoatom alleged that the pullout followed a number of Russian soldiers receiving “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone, a claim the IAEA said it could not independently confirm but would investigate. Energoatom said the troops had “panicked at the first sign of illness”, which “showed up very quickly”. Chernobyl’s No 4 reactor exploded on 26 April 1986, killing hundreds and spreading radioactive contamination west across Europe. The IAEA said earlier on Friday Kyiv had informed it that Russia had transferred control of the site back to the Ukrainians charged with overseeing the safe storage of spent fuel rods and maintaining the concrete-encased ruins of the reactor. But the UN agency said it could not independently confirm the claim that the Russian soldiers, whose capture of the plant raised fears around the world of increased radiological risks, had been exposed to radiation. Energoatom did not say how many soldiers were involved and gave no details of how they had been affected. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said Russian troops were exposed to radiation after digging trenches in the forest. Some Ukrainian reports have suggested the soldiers were taken to a special medical facility in nearby Belarus after driving tanks through the exclusion zone, kicking up radioactive dust. The Kremlin has not commented on the claims. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Associated Press on Friday it seemed unlikely a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but added that it was impossible to know for sure without more details. Citing plant workers, Energoatom said in a statement on Friday that the “Russian occupiers, as they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, took members of the national guard, whom they had held hostage since 24 February, with them”. The Ukrainian government had repeatedly expressed safety concerns about Chernobyl and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops, whose presence prevented the normal rotation of personnel for several weeks. Russian forces also retreated from the nearby town of Slavutych, where Chernobyl workers lived, Energoatom said, and the IAEA said it was preparing to send its first assistance and support mission to Chernobyl within the next few days. Grossi was due to hold talks with senior Russian officials in Kaliningrad on Friday after visiting a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday on his first trip to the country since the invasion. The IAEA chief, who has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the conflict – Ukraine has 15 reactors at four active nuclear power plants, as well as stores of nuclear waste at Chernobyl and elsewhere – was expected to hold a press conference at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna later on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T14:06:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 400 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 400 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Moscow court has formally arrested a reporter for the Wall Street Journal in relation to espionage allegations, according to Russian law enforcement agencies. Russia’s top security agency said Evan Gershkovich was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Ekaterinburg while allegedly trying to obtain classified information. The security service alleged that Gershkovich “was collecting classified information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex.” The Wall Street Journal “vehemently denies” allegations of espionage against Gershkovich, the newspaper said in a statement. The Moscow court has ordered Gershkovich should be held in pre-trial custody for nearly two months until 29 May, according to a court document. Gershkovich told the court that he was not guilty of espionage, state-run Tass news agency is reporting. A lawyer representing Gershkovich was not allowed to attend the hearing, according to Tass. Russian forces have had some success in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday evening, adding that their fighters were still holding on in a battle that has lasted several months. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War’s regular update appears to support this, saying, “geolocated footage published on March 28 and 29 indicates that Russian forces advanced in southern and southwestern Bakhmut.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow will continue to give the US advance notice about its missile tests despite suspending participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty, reversing a statement he made on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Alexei Moskalyov, a Russian man who was sentenced to two years in prison for discrediting the Russian armed forces, and whose daughter was taken into care, has been detained after fleeing house arrest, human rights activist and lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said on Thursday. It was earlier reported that Moskalyov was arrested in Minsk in Belarus, having fled his house arrest. The UK Ministry of Defence reports, citing Russian media, that authorities are preparing to launch a major recruitment campaign aimed at signing up 400,000 new troops to fight in Ukraine. Ukrainian volunteers who have been evacuating civilians from the frontlines of the war with Russia say some parents have been hiding their children in basements to prevent them from being taken. While parents have given different reasons, most volunteers have attributed the phenomenon to a combination of poverty and the psychological condition of the families, who have been living under bombing for months. European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski would support curbs on trading with Ukraine if Poland proposed such a solution, he said on Thursday, amid anger from farmers over the effect of Ukrainian imports on grain prices. Lawmakers from the pro-Russia, far-right Freedom Party walked out of the lower house of Austria’s parliament on Thursday during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, protesting that it violated Austria’s neutrality. Austria says its neutrality prevents it from military involvement in the conflict and while it supports Ukraine politically it cannot send the country weapons in its fight against the Russian invasion. The Freedom Party (FPÖ) had warned days before that it would hold some form of protest against the address. Four bankers who helped a close friend of Vladimir Putin move millions of francs through Swiss bank accounts have been convicted of lacking diligence in financial transactions. The four were found guilty on Thursday of helping Sergey Roldugin, a concert cellist who has been dubbed “Putin’s wallet” by the Swiss government. China said its military was willing to work together with the Russian military to strengthen strategic communication and coordination. Dymtro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has criticised the fact that Russia will take over chairing the UN security council on 1 April, describing it as a “bad joke”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to attend the Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on 3 April to 5 April. He will meet Kuleba, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. King Charles III lauded the current unity between the UK and Germany in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying “the scourge of war is back in Europe”. The king said both the UK and Germany had shown “vital leadership” and praised Berlin’s decision to provide large military support to Ukraine as “remarkably courageous, important and appreciated”. Criticism by some European governments – including Ukraine’s – of a plan for a full return of Russian and Belarusian athletes to international sport is deplorable and cuts into the autonomy of sport, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, Thomas Bach, said on Thursday. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that Moscow was still talking to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the idea of a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has been controlled by Russian forces since March 2022. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, had made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine on Wednesday amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked.” Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/27/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Six months of hell in Ukraine: how Putin’s war reached deadlock This week, Ukraine celebrated 31 years of independence from Soviet rule and marked six months of fighting against Moscow’s forces. The Russian president’s hopes of a swift victory have come to nothing. Peace talks have stalled. Where do we go from here? asks Shaun Walker. In the early hours of the morning of 24 February, the Russian assault began, with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and ground troops pouring into the country from three directions. That fateful decision has changed Ukraine, Russia and the world irrevocably over the intervening six months. Thousands of Ukrainians are dead and millions displaced. In the chaotic first days, events moved incredibly fast. By the end of the first week, the country had already settled into a new reality. Split-second decisions often meant life or death. Throughout the occupied areas around Kyiv, Russian soldiers committed murder and other war crimes, leaving psychological wounds that are likely to fester for generations. In the southern city of Mariupol, stories of burying bodies in shallow courtyard graves, of sheltering in damp, freezing basements, of illness, miscarriages, starvation and deprivation, were reminiscent of the second world war. However, amid all the horror and trauma, an uplifting story emerged of a newly united country where previous divisions evaporated in the face of the existential threat from the east. Ukraine independence day overshadowed by fear Isobel Koshiw and Emma Graham-Harrison reported from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, where the fear of escalating Russian attacks overshadowed a sombre independence day on Wednesday. A display of destroyed Russian tanks and other military equipment on the main street replaced the usual military parade through the city centre, both a celebration of Ukraine’s military success and a trolling of Moscow’s expectations of a quick victory. “I’m constantly worried and praying that our skies remain blue,” said Yana Pasychnyk, a choral singer in one of Ukraine’s national choirs. “People I know, my godson even, is fighting at the front. There’s no celebration today. I can’t even believe that this is happening”. Many in the capital took stock of both their achievements and losses. Few outside Ukraine, even among its allies, expected the country to hold off Russia’s army so effectively, including in a decisive victory outside Kyiv. Shortly before Zelenskiy was scheduled to appear before the UN security council, news of a Russian strike at a train station in the eastern Ukrainian town of Chaplyne surfaced. At least 25 people were killed and 50 wounded. Shelling disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The plant was disconnected twice after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors, Isobel Koshiw explained. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday. “If the diesel generators had not turned on … if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident.” Earlier in the week, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company shared a detailed plan drawn up by Russia to disconnect the plant with Emma Graham-Harrison. Petro Kotin said Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system.” The plant’s electricity connections were already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also downed, Kotin added. Daughter of Putin ally killed by car bomb in Moscow Andrew Roth covered the moment the daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue and ally of Vladimir Putin was killed in a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday night. Darya Dugina, whose father is the Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, died when the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving was ripped apart by a powerful explosion at about 9.30pm local time (1930 BST), according to investigators. Prominent Russian hawks tried – without evidence – to quickly blame Kyiv for the attack, calling it an “assassination attempt” orchestrated by Ukraine’s intelligence services. Kyiv has strongly denied the allegations. Shaun Walker mused how each new claim over the attack seemed to raise more questions than it answered. Russia’s FSB security service claimed to have cracked the case, alleging a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment entered Russia with her 12-year-old daughter in tow before moving around in her Mini Cooper, planting and detonating a professional explosive device and finally leaving the country undetected. If the FSB’s version of events were true, it is a shocking agency failure and, if false, it is a strangely self-incriminating tale to invent. Other versions of events floated also seemed far from watertight. The former Russian MP Ilya Ponomarev, now living in exile in Kyiv, claimed that partisans from a hitherto-unknown group called the National Republican Army were behind the attack. But Ponomarev did not provide any evidence, and many observers have dismissed the claim as a publicity stunt. Officials in Ukraine suggested the killing was more likely to be a “false flag” operation, organised by the Russian state in order to frame Ukraine and provide a justification for further violence. Five predictions for the next six months in the Ukraine war Dan Sabbagh provides a rundown of what to expect for the next six months of Russia’s invasion. 1. The war will probably run on for a year at least but is essentially deadlocked and its intensity is lessening. Six months of war may have gone by, but neither Ukraine nor Russia are ready to stop fighting. There have been no recent negotiations and movement in the frontlines has been minimal since June. Both sides are struggling for momentum and increasingly appear combat-exhausted. 2. Ukraine has no means of effective conventional counterattack, while guerrilla raids are an optimistic way to precipitate a Russian collapse. Ukraine would like to retake Kherson in the south but has so far failed to do so, shifting its strategy to mounting long-range missile attacks and daring special forces raids on Russian bases deep behind the frontlines. 3. Russia is likely to be shifting to holding on its gains and annexing Ukraine territory. Russia has no new offensive plan but by holding large swathes of Ukrainian territory in the east and south, it is actively talking about holding annexation referendums. With cooler weather fast approaching, it is likely to focus on consolidating what it has. 4. Winter will precipitate a fresh refugee crisis and create an opportunity for whoever can best prepare. Ukraine has no gas heating available for many in frontline areas, and is concerned Russia will target its energy grid and even turn off the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, precipitating what could be a fresh wave of migration abroad in the winter. Spring, though, could be the time for a renewed attack, with each side wanting to replenish and prepare for another fighting season. 5. The west needs to decide if it wants Ukraine to win or just hold on. Ukraine would have been defeated without western military aid. But at no point so far has the west supplied enough artillery or other weapons, such as fighter jets, that would allow Kyiv to drive the invaders back. At the same time, the west needs to match humanitarian help to the huge and growing need.

No wonder Australian kids don’t vote conservative","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Among the myriad indicators of Liberal dysfunction, one statistic leaps out: voters under 34 now prefer the Greens to the Coalition. The figures suggest Australian youth reject the traditional alternative government, opting instead for a party considerably to Labor’s left. No one should be surprised that conservatism does not appeal to those with nothing to conserve, nor that young people reject a status quo so manifestly stacked against them. The recent stories about student debt illustrate the rigged hand dealt to the young. Hecs-Help debts don’t gather interest. That’s because they’re not meant to grow – but, suddenly, they are. Back in the day, the indexation of student loan to inflation didn’t signify much. In today’s economy, however, an average debt of $25,000 jumps by $1,760 after June. According to the National Union of Students, the latest rise in CPI increases the liabilities of graduates by a remarkable $4.5bn. The hike feels both grotesquely unfair, but also, in a way, entirely predictable, another grim example of young people punished for doing everything right. The social theorist Stuart Hall famously described race as the modality through which class gets lived. Something similar might be said about age, a category into which every injustice seems to crystallise. Consider housing. Despite a softer property market, home ownership remains impossible for much of the population. If rising interest rates pushed prices down marginally, they rendered mortgages correspondingly less viable, while contributing to a precipitous increase in rents. To put it another way, people still can’t buy houses – and now they can’t rent them, either. The housing crisis screws lots of people (Anglicare describes fewer than 1% of rental properties as within the budget of those on the minimum wage) but, in particular, it screws the young, who can’t muster deposits for bank loans, and feel deep in their bones they never will. Understandably, many contrast their circumstances with the norms prevailing a few decades ago, back when Matt Groening could conceive a TV show centred on a schlubbish everyman in a dead-end job and then portray Homer Simpson living in a spacious suburban house with a wife and three kids. Homer still toils in Springfield’s nuclear power plant but his demographic cohort now runs the world. In Australia, most of our politicians attended (as did this writer) university back when students paid next to nothing for education. Not coincidentally, the average parliamentarian owns, or has a stake in, two houses, with many MPs having considerably more. Karen Andrews, for instance, reportedly owns seven properties and Tony Burke, six; one-time public housing tenant Anthony Albanese now gets $115,000 in rent from his real estate portfolio. The generational unfairness evident manifests just about everywhere. Take a look at the ABC’s mind-blowing visualisation (really – just look at it!) of the stage-three tax cuts, a policy to which Labor apparently remains committed. As Guardian columnist Greg Jericho writes: “Almost half of the total benefits go to the richest 3% and so massive are the costs at $300bn over 9 years, that you could raise jobseeker from its current rate of $693 a fortnight to $1,925 and you would still end up with a smaller government deficit in 2032-33 than you would with the Stage 3 tax cuts.” But it’s also worth noting that, as well as facilitating a tremendous transfer of wealth to the rich (such as politicians, who stand to benefit by $18m in the next decade), the change disproportionately rewards older Australians, with those under 25 receiving only 2.8% of the billions directed to the ageing and the well-to-do in 2024. Even as he slashes the governmental revenue base, Albanese wants to spend $368bn on nuclear submarines. I’ve written previously on the dangers of the arms race playing out in Asia Pacific and the astonishing insouciance with which strategists now discuss conflict between nuclear powers. But recall, too, how when the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald convened a panel of anti-China hawks to urge a “psychological shift” in preparedness for war, its experts also suggested the reintroduction of military service. Now, we’re not going to see conscription any time soon but the very suggestion illustrates the dynamic of intensifying geostrategic tension: old people might plan wars but young people will have to fight them. And then there’s climate change, the most profound generational crime imaginable. Environmentalists describe the period after the second world war as “the great acceleration”, when the spread of American-style consumer capitalism massively intensified the depletion of nature. That era also coincided with the baby boom. By contrast, if you’re 20 now, you’ll turn 47 in 2050, meaning you’ll still be in the prime of life as, on current trends, parts of the planet become too hot for human habitation, extreme weather grows increasingly common, millions of people get driven from their homes and extinctions cascade through the biosphere. That’s the legacy handed to young people by their elders, a crisis on a scale unparalleled in human history. No wonder the kids don’t vote Liberal – and that so many of them mistrust the ALP. Of course, as a theory of social change, generationalism only gets you so far. Poverty, racism and bigotry affect people of all ages. No one can live on Australia’s welfare system – but, statistically, one of the biggest groups forced to do so consists of women over 45. While most voters under 30 despise the conservatives, you can still find plenty of young men attracted to the far right. For all the memes mocking Karens, today’s progressives owe a huge intellectual debt to a New Left founded by boomers. Sure, some Vietnam-era protesters aged into a sour conservatism but plenty of them didn’t: at any environment or refugee rally, you’ll encounter octogenarians far more militant than the gen Zers around them. As for climate change, it’s an oppression multiplier, with global heating disproportionately affecting all the traditional victims of injustice. Nevertheless, it’s entirely right for young people to feel cheated by what they’ve inherited, to despair about those politicians who won’t live to see the consequences of their environmental timidity, and to despise the greybeards wringing their hands about gender diversity and drag queens while lauding as a comic genius an old guy in a dress. A thousand years or so ago, Bob Dylan warned parents that their sons and daughters were beyond their command. If youth rebellion was justified then, it’s a million times more warranted today. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-seeing-first-localised-results-says-kyiv-icc-probe-of-kakhovka-dam-disaster-has-begun","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T17:56:19Z","webTitle":"Too soon to say where counteroffensive going, US says, but Washington confident Kyiv will prevail – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-seeing-first-localised-results-says-kyiv-icc-probe-of-kakhovka-dam-disaster-has-begun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-seeing-first-localised-results-says-kyiv-icc-probe-of-kakhovka-dam-disaster-has-begun","fields":{"headline":"Too soon to say where counteroffensive going, US says, but Washington confident Kyiv will prevail – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Monday it was too soon to say exactly where Ukraine’s counteroffensive was going, but said Washington was confident that Kyiv would continue to have success in trying to take back its land seized by Russia. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said the US was determined to maximise its support for Ukraine so that it could succeed on the battlefield. One man was killed and another was wounded in a Russian attack on the small town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region of south-east Ukraine, the regional governor, Yuri Malashko, said on Monday. Malashko said three bombs damaged private houses and communications in the small town, about 5 miles (8km) from frontlines. He said the man who was killed was 48 and the one who was wounded was 32, Reuters reported. Footage released by Ukraine shows marines in a village it claims to have recaptured in its counteroffensive against Russian forces. Soldiers held up the Ukrainian flag in Storozheve, in a video posted online. The defence minister thanked the 35th Separate Brigade of Marines for regaining control of the village. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday he was concerned that Russia would on 17 July quit a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Moscow has been threatening to walk away from the deal, known as the Black Sea grain initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year, if obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser shipments are not removed. The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are working on a scheme to combat the suspected theft of Ukraine’s grain by using chemical identification of grain origin, Britain’s food and farming minister, Mark Spencer, said on Monday. Spencer told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London that Britain was leading on the scheme and that G7 countries were also working closely with Ukraine, the world’s fourth largest grains exporter. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. The largest Nato military jet exercise since the foundation of the alliance was taking place today in the skies over Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. About 10,000 soldiers from 25 countries were involved, making use of 250 military jets – 70 from Germany – to prepare for an attack on one of Nato’s members. Although the exercise was planned long before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it is nevertheless being viewed as a signal towards the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin marked Russia’s national day on Monday by appealing to Russians’ patriotic pride at what he said was a “difficult time” for the country. However, speaking at a lavish award-giving ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin made no direct comment on the latest developments in Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive and have retaken several villages in the eastern Donetsk region over the past few days. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and farther south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after the mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all “volunteer units” should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. The former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev celebrated Russia Day by posting a an edited image to Telegram that showed Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Work has started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed from the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Lawyers for Ukraine at the top UN court have rejected Russia’s account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a “rambling conspiracy theory”, in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russia forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew, in July 2014, Reuters reports. Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had “overall control” over the separatist forces. Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the international court of justice, Russia said Ukraine’s MH17 case was based on “nonsense” and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened. On Monday, Ukraine’s lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been “subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory” about the shooting down of MH17 that would be “better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet”. Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and to order it to pay reparations. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Monday it was too soon to say exactly where Ukraine’s counteroffensive was going, but said Washington was confident that Kyiv would continue to have success in trying to take back its land seized by Russia. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said the US was determined to maximise its support for Ukraine so it could succeed on the battlefield. He said a “robust” package of political and practical support for Ukraine could be expected at the upcoming Nato summit in Vilnius. Footage released by Ukraine shows marines in a village it claims to have recaptured in its counteroffensive against Russian forces. Soldiers held up the Ukrainian flag in Storozheve, in a video posted online. The defence minister thanked the 35th Separate Brigade of Marines for regaining control of the village. The location of the footage can be verified from the buildings, trees and road layout but the date the video was filmed could not be verified. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday he was concerned that Russia would on 17 July quit a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Moscow has been threatening to walk away from the deal, known as the Black Sea grain initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year, if obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser shipments are not removed. “I am concerned and we are working hard in order to make sure that it will be possible to maintain the Black Sea initiative and at the same time that we are able to go on in our work to facilitate Russian exports,” Guterres told reporters. A fifth village has been liberated by Ukrainian forces as part of its counteroffensive, it has been reported. The Institute for the Study of War reported that Ukraine said earlier on Monday that Kyiv had reclaimed five towns and villages. Sky News has since reported: The fifth has now been corroborated by the Zaporizhzhia separate territorial defence brigade, which said they had taken Novodarivka. “Numerous attempts by the enemy to return the settlement under control, which lasted several days, were unsuccessful,” the Zaporizhzhia separate territorial defence brigade said. One man was killed and another was wounded in a Russian attack on the small town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region of south-east Ukraine, the regional governor, Yuri Malashko, said on Monday. Malashko said three bombs damaged private houses and communications in the small town, about 8km (5 miles) from frontlines. He said the man who was killed was 48 and the one who was wounded was 32, Reuters reported. Officials have said several hundred residents remain in the town, although infrastructure there has been largely destroyed by Russian forces, which seized most of the Zaporizhzhia region in the early months of its full-scale invasion last year. Ukraine says its troops have taken back four villages from Russian forces in the south-east after hitting back to try to recapture occupied territory. The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are working on a scheme to combat the suspected theft of Ukraine’s grain by using chemical identification of grain origin, Britain’s food and farming minister, Mark Spencer, said on Monday. Spencer told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London that Britain was leading on the scheme and that G7 countries were also working closely with Ukraine, the world’s fourth largest grains exporter. “We believe [chemical identification] will be an effective means for deterring further theft of Ukraine’s grain,” Spencer said. Britain announced a new wave of sanctions last month on Russia over its war against Ukraine, targeting “shady individuals and entities” connected to the suspected theft of Ukrainian grain, Reuters reported. Targeting entities involved in grain trading is unusual as such activity typically comes under humanitarian exemptions from sanctions. Russia and Ukraine are major grain exporters to developing countries in Africa and the Middle East. Suspilne reports that a man has died and private housing and communications have been destroyed as a result of a Russian attack. Citing a regional authority, it said: “As a result of a Russian strike with guided aerial bombs on Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, a man died, another was hospitalised. Destroyed private houses and communications.” Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine has been striking at civilian and humanitarian targets, and that it makes no military sense. In quotes carried by Tass, the Russian president is reported to have said: Why, frankly, is the enemy hitting residential areas? No logic. For what, why, what’s the point? And obviously humanitarian targets – it’s amazing. And there is no military sense, it’s zero. He is said to have made the comments during conversations while giving out awards earlier today. As of May 2023, the UN had recorded 18,802 civilian casualties, including 6,754 killed, in areas of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv and attacked by Russian forces. Ukraine has launched some cross-border shelling into Russian regions bordering the country including Kursk and Belgorod, and is accused of launching drone attacks on targets within Russia’s borders. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a video of the latest prisoner exchange on Twitter. To accompany the footage, Ukraine’s president wrote: “Every time we bring our people back from Russian captivity, we remember our fundamental goal: we will not leave anyone of ours, nothing of Ukraine to the enemy. “Yesterday we returned 95 more of our guys, our warriors, from captivity. In total, since 24 February last year, we have already returned 2,526 Ukrainians. […] “We remember everyone, we are searching for each and every one of them, and we have to bring them all back. And we will!” The largest Nato military jet exercise since the foundation of the alliance is taking place today in the skies over Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. About 10,000 soldiers from 25 countries are involved, making use of 250 military jets – 70 from Germany – to prepare for an attack on one of Nato’s members. Although the exercise was planned long before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it is nevertheless being viewed as a signal towards Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin. The manoeuvres, called Air Defender 2023, are taking place under German leadership. They are being interpreted, in Germany at least, as a chance for Europe’s largest country to prove its military capabilities, even as it has been perceived as being reluctant or slow to provide full-blown support to Ukraine. However, recognised now as the second biggest provider of military support to Ukraine after the United States, German defence chiefs say it is a useful exercise not least in proving Germany’s commitment to European and international security. Civilian aircraft are expected to be mildly affected by the exercises, with some delays due at airports in Germany. However, Ingo Gerhartz, inspector of Germany’s air force, said delays would be kept to a minimum. The exercise had been deliberately timed to take place before the main holiday period to cause as little disruption as possible. However, Matthias Maas, the head of the German air traffic controller union, GdF, said he expected the exercise would have a “massive impact” on the timetable of civil airlines. President Vladimir Putin marked Russia’s national day on Monday by appealing to Russians’ patriotic pride at what he said was a “difficult time” for the country. However, speaking at a lavish award-giving ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin made no direct comment on the latest developments in Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive and have retaken several villages in the eastern Donetsk region over the past few days. “This public holiday marks the inseparability of our centuries-old history, the greatness and glory of the fatherland,” Putin told the assembled dignitaries. “Today, at a difficult time for Russia, [feelings of patriotism and pride] unite our society even more strongly … [and] serve as a reliable support for our heroes taking part in the special military operation [in Ukraine],” Putin said. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have moved along both sides of the river, southwards from the town of Velyka Novosilka, declaring the liberation of a string of villages: Blahodatne on the east bank and Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve on the west side. The armed forces have published pictures of their units holding up flags in what were claimed to be the recaptured villages. The claims could not be independently verified, but Russian military bloggers confirmed the Ukrainian advance and reported heavy fighting overnight and on Monday morning for the next village along, Urozhaine, on the east bank of the river, straddling the road south-east towards Mariupol. Russia’s defence ministry on Monday said Ukrainian forces had attempted to press their offensives in the south of the Donetsk region in the last 24 hours, Russian news agencies reported. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the battlefield reports. Swiss authorities said several government websites were targeted in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday that was claimed by pro-Russian hackers. The attack comes as the Swiss parliament prepares for a video address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, scheduled for Thursday, and coincides with a national holiday in Russia, Reuters reported. Switzerland’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said that “various websites of the federal administration and enterprises affiliated with the confederation were unavailable” in the wake of the attack, claimed by the NoName hacking group. “The NCSC is analysing the attack together with the administrative units concerned and defining appropriate measures,” it said in a statement. The NCSC, which did not link Zelenskiy’s upcoming address to the attack, said the NoName group had also been behind a separate attack against the Swiss parliament’s website last week. Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have liberated several frontline villages in western Donetsk, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit’s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, Kyiv said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on Monday morning. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and farther south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank The Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all “volunteer units” should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a an edited image to Telegram which shows Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. Three civilians were killed Sunday and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt at the weekend to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has reported that Avdiivka was struck this morning. He posted to Telegram: The terrorists hit the city again this morning, at 09.10am, with two rockets. According to preliminary information, there were no casualties; the wounded are provided with medical assistance in a local hospital. Kyrylenko posted images which he said showed damage to the House of Culture on Tsentralnyi Prospect, and damaged residential high-rise buildings. The claims have not been independently verified. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a photoshopped image to Telegram which shows Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Russia’s initial full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 included a failed attempt to take Ukraine’s capital with forces launched from Belarus. Here are some more images that have been sent over the news wires of the flooding in Kherson James Waterhouse, the BBC’s Ukraine correspondent, has this to temper enthusiasm for the news being released from Kyiv about the liberation of villages in Ukraine’s south. He writes: The sight of soldiers once again liberating villages is an exciting one for Kyiv and its allies. What we will hear less about, is where progress has been slower or nonexistent. In the Zaporizhzhia region, a lot of men &amp; equipment have been lost as Ukraine probes for weaknesses. Lt Dmitry Mishov, a member of Russian service personnel who, rather than be sent to serve in Ukraine, defected to Lithuania and applied for political asylum, has given an interview to the BBC in which he said: I am a military officer, my duty is to protect my country from aggression. I don’t have to become an accomplice in a crime. No one explained to us why this war started, why we had to attack Ukrainians and destroy their cities? In the military no one believes the authorities. They can see what is really happening. They are not some civilians in front of the telly. The military do not believe official reports, because they are simply not true. I was not refusing to serve in the army as such. I would serve my country if it faced a real threat. I was only refusing to be an accomplice in a crime. Had I boarded that helicopter [for an unspecified mission he suspected was deployment to Ukraine], I would have taken the lives of several dozen people, at the very least. I didn’t want to do that. Ukrainians are not our enemy. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine is in the UK at the moment, and has tweeted indicating the psychological toll residents of Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine are under. Melinda Simmons wrote: I am in the UK for some meetings and how it feels to not be in Ukraine after living through nightly Russian airstrikes is beyond words. A motorbike backfires and hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Any kind of bang and my heart races. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Reuters reports Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday.

In return, volunteer fighters would get the same benefits and protections as regular troops, including support for them and their families if they are wounded or killed. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Emma Graham-Harrison reports for us on the likely destruction of Polina Rayko’s house in Oleshky, Kherson, which famously housed her artwork painted all over the walls. It is thought to be under water after the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. Read more here: ‘Masterpiece’ house is latest victim of Putin’s war on Ukrainian heritage Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on developments in the last 24 hours: In the morning and at night, the Russian army attacked Kharkiv oblast: a man was wounded in Shevchenkove, another was injured during the shelling of Vilkhuvatka. In khorosheve, one two-story building was destroyed, the other was damaged. As of this morning, the average level of flooding in the Kherson region is 3.29m. Since yesterday evening the water has receded by 64cm. The Kakhovka reservoir has already lost more than 72% of its water. Over the past day, three people were killed and 12 injured in Kherson oblast due to shelling by the Russian army; one person died in Donetsk region, two others were injured; in Zaporizhzhia, a woman was wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. It is Russia day today, and in occupied Luhansk the Russian-imposed leader Leonid Pasechnik has issued a statement saying that the claimed annexation of the Ukrainian region by the Russian Federation had given it “a new life”. Tass quotes Pasechnik saying in a statement: Having reunited with Russia, we felt the attention from the state, the unity and mutual assistance of the peoples of a vast country. Social protection, large-scale construction, modernisation of education and healthcare, the revival of agriculture and industry – Luhansk region, without exaggeration, received a new life. Luhansk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed to annex late last year, despite not controlling the entirety of the territory. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Kherson over the news wires. Ukraine has issued this video which shows footage from the liberation of Storozheve. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on her Telegram channel. It is a really tiny place, a hamlet, across the Mokri Yaly river from Blahodatne, which was recaptured over the weekend. She wrote: The national flag is flying over Storozheve again, and it will be the same with every settlement until we liberate all Ukrainian land. Thank you Rear Adm Mykhailo Ostrogradskyi, 35th Separate Brigade of Marines. To be continued … Glory to Ukraine! According to Russian military bloggers, the battle is on now for Urozhaine to the south, as the Ukrainians fight their way village to village, on both sides of the river. Ukrainian officials say the Russians blew up a small dam on the Mokri Yaly upstream, in an effort to hinder the offensive. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that a 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. It cited the local authority as the source of the information. My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, has described the latest developments as “incremental, but real progress” for Ukraine, while posting an image which purports to show the liberation of the village of Storozheve. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian forces gained territory over the weekend while carrying out counteroffensive operations in at least three areas of the frontline, the Institute for the Study of War has said. The US thinktank said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The institute said in its update that Kyiv had reported that Ukrainian forces were conducting offensive operations in the Bakhmut area and that Russian sources had reported continued Ukrainian ground attacks on the northern and southern flanks of the city, in the Donetsk region. Geolocated footage and Russian sources indicated that Ukrainian forces liberated multiple settlements during continued ground attacks south, southwest and southeast of Velyka Novosilka in western Donetsk oblast. The institute quoted the Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, as saying Russian forces were transferring their most combat-capable units from the Kherson direction towards the Bakhmut and Zaporizhia areas. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots, a day after Kyiv said it had made the first modest gains in reclaiming territory from Russia in its counteroffensive. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and further south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, but also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. Reuters also reported that Ukraine had said on Sunday that its troops had made advances on three villages in Donetsk: Blahodatne, Neskuchne and Makarivka. The claims could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Russian officials. Some prominent Russian military bloggers indicated that while Ukrainian forces took Blahodatne and Neskuchne, fighting for Makarivka was going on. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In his nightly video address on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said representatives of the court had visited the Kherson region in recent days. He said: On the very first day after the disaster, the general prosecutor’s office sent a corresponding request to the international criminal court concerning an investigation of this disaster and the work has already begun. Zelenskiy said it was important that international legal experts saw the aftermath of the disaster, including incidents of shelling of flooded areas. Officials said three people were killed on Sunday in Russian shelling of boats carrying evacuees. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian rescue teams had evacuated about 4,000 residents from affected zones, including areas on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River. Ukraine has said its troops have recaptured three villages from Russian forces in its south-east, the first liberated settlements it has reported since launching a counteroffensive last week. Kyiv’s forces posted unverified videos showing soldiers hoisting the Ukrainian flag at a bombed-out building in the village of Blahodatne, in the Donetsk region, and posing with their unit’s flag in the adjacent village of Neskuchne, Reuters reported. Valeryi Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s “Tavria” military sector, said on television on Sunday: We’re seeing the first results of the counteroffensive actions, localised results. Ukraine’s army also retook Makarivka, the next village to the south, and advanced between 300 and 1,500 metres in two directions on the southern front, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a statement. She added: No positions were lost on the directions where our forces are on the defensive. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that a Ukrainian military push was well under way but that it had failed so far to breach Russian defensive lines and had taken heavy casualties. Kyiv officials have imposed a strict period of operational silence and urged Ukrainians not to disclose any information that could compromise the operation. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a roundup of the latest developments to bring you up to speed. Ukraine says it is seeing the first results of its counteroffensive and that its forces have recaptured three villages from Russia in south-eastern Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces posted videos showing them raising the Ukrainian flag in the village of Blahodatne in the Donetsk region and posing with their unit’s flag in the adjacent village of Neskuchne, while Kyiv said its troops had also retaken the village of Makarivka to the south. “We’re seeing the first results of the counteroffensive actions, localised results,” Valeryi Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Tavria military sector, said on television. Counteroffensive operations were launched last week. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said work had already begun in an investigation by the international criminal court into the Kakhovka dam disaster and the vast flood damage it caused. He said representatives of the court had visited the Kherson region in recent days after the dam breach, which Ukraine has accused Russian forces of causing. More on both those stories shortly. In other news: Three civilians were killed and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his fighters would not sign contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its control. “Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,” Prigozhin said on Sunday, adding that the minister “cannot properly manage military formations”. Wagner was completely subordinated to the interests of Russia, Prigozhin said, but its command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the Kakhovka dam breach led to major flooding. Russia also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in the Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said, while the Tass news agency reported Russian air defence systems shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said. Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from launching an offensive and advancing in the southern Kherson region, according to Kyiv’s deputy defence minister. Hanna Maliar said the action was also intended to help Russia deploy reserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia and Ukraine have simultaneously swapped nearly 100 prisoners each. The Ukrainian prisoners included members of the national guard and border guards who had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Russia’s defence minister has awarded medals to soldiers after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia’s highest military honour, on Sunday to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. Two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia’s Kaluga region – one near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district, according to the region’s governor, Vladislav Shapsha. There were no casualties and only minimal damage, he said on Telegram. A US citizen arrested in Russia on drugs charges this week is a military veteran and musician who has lived in Moscow for nearly a decade. Travis Michael Leake and a friend, Valeria Grobanyuk, were arrested in a drug raid that has the potential to further ignite tensions between Washington and Moscow. “I don’t understand why I’m here,” said a man shown on camera and identified by Russian state media as Leake. “I do not admit my guilt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T19:03:56Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B owner says it will not extend life of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point B owner says it will not extend life of nuclear plant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The owner of one of the UK’s six nuclear power plants has said it will not extend its life beyond a planned shutdown in summer, despite officials raising concerns over the danger of blackouts in the months that follow. The French-owned EDF Energy sent a memo to staff on Monday in which it said it would not postpone the closure of the two reactors at Hinkley Point B in Somerset, which are scheduled to be shut down on 8 July and 1 August. The closure of the plant will remove nearly a gigawatt of power generation capacity from the UK’s system – enough to supply 1.5m homes – before a winter in which the war in Ukraine is expected to weigh heavily on electricity supplies. The government has played down fears of power cuts later this year, after it emerged that officials had modelled a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that could include millions of households being forced to limit their electricity consumption at peak times. That modelling, which was first reported by the Times, included an option to extend Hinkley Point B, something mooted by experts and politicians for months. But it is understood the government had not made any formal request for EDF to keep the reactors open. The government is scrambling to secure enough electricity to maintain buffers during the winter as households struggle with a cost of living crisis driven by energy prices that are expected to increase further in the autumn. Last week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to the National Grid’s electricity system operator, asking it to work with the owners of coal-fired power plants that were due to closed down in September to extend their operating lives. This was despite the government’s commitment to rapidly phase out the heavily polluting fuel. Chris Philp, a culture minister who does not have oversight of the energy industry, told Times Radio on Monday morning that Kwarteng was considering whether Hinkley Point B might continue beyond its “planned end of life”. But later in the day EDF wrote to staff: “Although it is technically feasible to extend operations [at the nuclear plant] for up to six months, the time required to do this and to be confident we would be ready for winter operating has now run out.” The memo, which was revealed by the Financial Times, added that an extension would involve compiling a detailed safety case that would have to be approved by the UK’s nuclear regulator. A government source said any decision to apply for an extension would be a matter for EDF and the regulator, and added that the government had secured enough power capacity even without extending the operation of the coal or nuclear plants. However, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said it was very likely that EDF would require a written request from a minister before deciding to go through the laborious process of submitting a new safety case to the regulator, which is run at arm’s length from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). “On Hinkley B, there is no technical reason it can’t continue to operate, if they can satisfy the regulators. For EDF, it will be fundamentally an economic decision,” said Malcolm Grimston, an honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London’s centre for energy policy and technology. Insiders in the sector expressed concern over the lack of time the government had left to take any action, with one saying: “They’ve left it right to the very end, and we’re not sure if it’s possible.” Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents engineers including those who work in the nuclear industry, said: “All options to prevent energy blackouts this winter must be explored. “The government must ask nuclear power plant operators to urgently explore safely extending the life of reactors due to be decommissioned in the coming months, including Hinkley Point B, which is otherwise due to come offline this summer.” A spokesperson for Boris Johnson said: “Neither the government or National Grid expect power cuts this winter.” Sources at BEIS also suggested the prospect of rolling blackouts was “very unlikely”. EDF declined to comment. A government spokesperson said: “Any extensions to operational dates for the UK’s nuclear power stations are a matter for the operator of the stations, EDF and the regulator the Office of Nuclear Regulation, which are based on safety considerations. “The government has no direct involvement in this process and has not made any requests of this kind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T20:32:32Z","webTitle":"Physical integrity of Zaporizhzhia plant ‘violated’, says UN nuclear chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","fields":{"headline":"Physical integrity of Zaporizhzhia plant ‘violated’, says UN nuclear chief","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, as Ukraine’s authorities accused Russia of misleading the inspection mission. After leading a team of inspectors to the Russian-occupied plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, Rafael Grossi said that two IAEA experts would stay on permanently to provide constant monitoring and an uninterrupted flow of information to IAEA headquarters in Vienna. Grossi hoped the agency’s presence would help “stabilise” the situation there, after recent instances of shelling of the plant. But he said he remained very concerned about safety. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters. “Irrespective of the kinetic power of whatever you are throwing at the plant, it’s unacceptable under any safety and security criteria.” He said his other two main concerns were the external power supply which had been interrupted recently triggering the emergency diesel generators to switch on to keep cooling and other systems going, and the condition of the staff. Once back in Vienna, Grossi said it was “admirable” that Ukrainian technical staff were continuing to work to keep the plant going (two of the six reactors are still functioning) and maintaining professional relations with their Russian counterparts, but he added: “There is a latent tension there because of the obvious reasons of the war.” Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, had claimed that the IAEA was not shown certain areas of the site, and instead had witnessed a staged “show”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of intimidating residents in the nearby town of Enerhodar to lie to the IAEA representatives about events at the plant and “sign things”. Grossi insisted he and his team had seen “everything I request to see”, but he conceded he was not able to talk to any of the Russian soldiers who have commandeered the plant’s crisis centre as their headquarters. “The military presence there did not approach us in any way and were not available when I asked for a couple of occasions to talk to one of them,” he said. The IAEA chief said an alternative crisis centre has been set up but added that he will be requesting the military to hand back the purpose built facility they are occupying. Grossi left six of his staff behind at the site, but four of them will leave next week, leaving two IAEA experts there permanently. The IAEA is there to stay for as long as it is needed. We are not leaving. We’re not going anywhere,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has an inherently very important stabilising effect.” Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant, with Ukraine claiming they are false-flag operations carried out by Russia. Zelenskiy also voiced concerns over Ukrainian and international journalists not being allowed to travel with the delegation, as previously agreed. He said the occupying forces did not allow the journalists to cross the frontlines. “Unfortunately, IAEA representatives did not protect representatives of independent media,” said Zelenskiy, who said only Russian propagandists were present. Zelenskiy said the key thing for Ukraine and the international community was the demilitarisation of the plant. He said it was “bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls [for demilitarisation] from the IAEA”. Russian state media have published videos of Russian officials from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear agency, giving the mission a tour of the plant. Grossi said his agency would complete a full report on the visit by early next week and he would brief the UN security council on the visit next Tuesday. The Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, told Ukraine’s 1+1 television channel that “it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine”. Grossi said the security situation was “pretty difficult” during his visit. “There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery, mortars two or three times – we were very concerned.” But he said the mission received “splendid support from the UN security team”. “I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we will be continuing this,” Grossi said. Zaporizhzhia, has faced repeated shelling in recent weeks, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks, raising concerns of a possible disaster. On Thursday, a dawn shelling attack on the area forced one of the plant’s six reactors to shut down. On Friday afternoon the electricity supply to a reactor was reconnected after it was cut for the second time in 10 days because of shelling, according to Energoatom. The plant needs electricity for its cooling and security systems. In the event all supply lines are cut, the plant’s workers would have 90 minutes to avoid dangerous overheating. In a video address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant. “The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the station’s territory,” he said. “Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-19T10:20:29Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce expects UK approval for small nuclear reactors by mid-2024","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce expects UK approval for small nuclear reactors by mid-2024","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce is to start building parts for its small modular nuclear reactors in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval from the British government by 2024, one of its directors has said. Paul Stein, the chairman of Rolls-Royce SMR, a subsidiary of the FTSE 100 engineering company, said he hoped to be providing power to the UK’s national grid by 2029. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are seen by their proponents as a way to build nuclear power plants in factories, a method that could be cheaper and quicker than traditional designs. The technology, based on the reactors used in nuclear submarines, is seen by Rolls-Royce as a potential earner far beyond any previous business such as jet engines or diesel motors. The government under Boris Johnson put nuclear power at the centre of its energy strategy announced earlier this month, in response to climate concerns and a desire to ditch Russian gas. SMRs are expected to play an inportant role in an expansion of nuclear to supply a quarter of the UK’s energy needs. Lower costs would be crucial in justifying the nuclear push, given that onshore wind is seen as much cheaper and quicker to install. Speaking to Reuters in an interview conducted virtually, Stein said the regulatory “process has been kicked off, and will likely be complete in the middle of 2024. We are trying to work with the UK government, and others to get going now placing orders, so we can get power on grid by 2029.” Other companies are also planning to build SMRs, including the US’s Westinghouse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T12:31:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 163 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 163 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of strikes near a nuclear reactor at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in the country’s southeast, which has been occupied since the early days of the invasion. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run operator of the country’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them have departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said he plans “to ensure ports have the ability to handle more than 100 vessels per month”. Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. Putin welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed exports of grain from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting. Russia says it is ready to talk about a prisoner swap with the US following Wednesday’s nine-year jail sentence for US basketball player Brittney Griner. However, the Kremlin says any such negotiations should not be played out publicly. Amnesty International has said it stands by its accusation that Ukraine is endangering civilians by creating army bases in residential areas to counter Russian forces, after a report from the rights group prompted a furious response from Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, criticised Amnesty over the report published on Thursday, saying the rights group was drawing a false equivalence between Ukraine as victim of aggression and the Russian invaders. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has raised concerns about the “security and safety” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. It says Russia has “used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river”. An EU plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. Canada is sending up to 225 Canadian armed forces to the UK to recommence the training of Ukrainian military recruits, the Canadian defence minister has announced. Since 2015, Canada has trained 33,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel but in February paused aspects of the training. A US official has accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, last week. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled TASS news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports. Ukraine has ceded some territory in the Donbas region to Russian forces, with Kyiv acknowledging Russia’s “partial success” in recent days. Zelenskiy has described the pressure his forces are under in the east of the country as “hell”. They have recaptured two villages near the city of Sloviansk, according to Ukrainian general Oleksiy Hromov, but have been forced to abandon a coal mine regarded as a key defensive position as forces are pushed to the outskirts of Avdiivka. Russia may launch an offensive in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson to try to wrest back momentum from Kyiv and has been visibly building up forces, Hromov said on Thursday. Much of the region is already occupied by Russia after it captured areas at the beginning of its invasion, but Ukrainian forces have been developing a counter-offensive to regain territory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T01:22:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 289 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 289 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released in a prisoner swap with Russia in exchange for former arms dealer Viktor Bout and was heading back to the United States on Thursday, ending what President Joe Biden called months of “hell” for her and her wife. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory, heightening radiation dangers. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”. Putin’s remarks came a day after he appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Meanwhile, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday the United States is confident that Finland and Sweden will be approved soon for membership of Nato despite ratification delays from members Turkey and Hungary. After meeting his Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Thursday, Blinken said both countries had proved their bona fides to join the alliance, most notably in joining Nato to provide support to Ukraine to counter Russia’s invasion. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. President Joe Biden has authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine, the White House said. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions. Friday’s intelligence update comes following new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in the Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call on Friday. Sunak said “more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks”, Downing Street said. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The grid is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tries to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible” Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/24/british-typhoon-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-24T17:59:20Z","webTitle":"Ben Wallace rules out sending British Typhoon jets to Ukraine in short term ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/british-typhoon-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/24/british-typhoon-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace","fields":{"headline":"Ben Wallace rules out sending British Typhoon jets to Ukraine in short term ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, rejecting a high profile campaign led by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the support of the former prime minister Boris Johnson. Ben Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The defence secretary said: “We’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,” in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday. But the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for “wings for freedom” in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Instead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets. Downing Street said it had always believed that western jets “wouldn’t help in the immediate future given the training timelines and support systems required” but added that RAF Typhoons could help other countries. “The PM has previously described our willingness to help support other countries who might be able to offer their capabilities, we could help backfill for example, in a range of things they might be required to do,” a spokesperson added. Poland has repeatedly said it is willing to supply Ukraine with its fleet of 28 MiG-29s “as part of a wider coalition”, although at least some of the jets are thought to have been broken up and supplied to Kyiv’s air force covertly as spare parts. Kyiv has also called for it to be supplied with US-made F-16s, the most widely available fighter jet worldwide, and discussions between the US and Ukraine continue, despite an initial rejection of the plan by Joe Biden, the US president, in late January. Ukrainian pilots will need to be retrained to use any western fighter aircraft – with the process taking anywhere from three months, as some of Kyiv’s pilots say, to six to nine months, as suggested by RAF insiders. Labour said it would support the government on whatever decision it made on fighter jets. The party leader, Keir Starmer, said: “We are not going to politically divide on this. We will support the government in the decision that it makes.” Part of the problem, Wallace added, was that a rapid deployment would have to involve hundreds of British ground crew having to relocate to Ukraine for support – although Ukraine hopes to train its own engineers as needed. “Gifting a fighter jet comes with hundreds of people: engineers, pilots, training, electronic warfare. The more complicated the platform, the greater the tail,” Wallace said, referring to the need for ground support. “The west is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine in those scales. The idea that we would put Typhoons in – we would have to send 200 RAF people and we’re not going to do that … at this current stage,” he added. Aviation experts have questioned whether RAF Typhoons, which traditionally fly from long, clear runways, would be suitable for Ukraine, given its need to operate in rough, dispersed airstrips to prevent planes being shot down by Russia. King Charles offered his support for Ukraine in a personal message issued on Friday. The country’s people, he said, have “suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack” and “shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy”. A minute’s silence was led by Rishi Sunak at 11am outside No 10. Joined by his wife, Akshata Murthy, the prime minister paid his respects to Ukrainians killed in the fighting, along with Kyiv’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said Ukraine must not be forced into a “Munich agreement-like compromise”, referring to the failed 1938 pre-war agreement that led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. The Anglican leader, writing in the Daily Telegraph, also called for a “just peace” between Russia and Ukraine, and a settlement that Moscow could consider fair. “Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression,” he added. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has announced an export ban on any equipment Russia is found to have used on the battlefield. The ban will mean companies cannot supply Russia with a range of items, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The Foreign Office also announced new sanctions on executives at several Russian companies, including the state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, two defence companies and four banks. Ukraine’s president thanked Sunak and the British people for “unwavering support” in “the fight against aggression”. Zelenskiy praised the prime minister for the sanctions package, and made no mention of the announcement regarding Typhoons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T16:33:56Z","webTitle":"Britishvolt saga exposes the danger of short-termism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","fields":{"headline":"Britishvolt saga exposes the danger of short-termism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Edgerton rightly draws attention to the emphasis so often placed on startup companies in UK industrial policy – or at least in political gestures towards the manufacturing sector (The woes of startup Britishvolt should shock the UK out of its Brexit self-delusion, 11 November). Real success is no easy win, especially in turning acorns into productive oak trees. For example, civil aerospace production, one of the UK’s major industrial successes, now supports several thousand jobs and reels in millions annually in foreign exchange. This achievement stands on the back of more than 75 years of largely public investment. For much of the time this was unprofitable. Up to 1974, the UK government had invested nearly £740m in civil aircraft for a return of less than £54m. The breakthrough was a result of joining the Airbus consortium. Even then, success came only with the third member of the Airbus family, the A320. This has handsomely repaid government investment of £400m, with more than £1bn returned over 30 years. Returns from later Airbus types have been more modest, but the A320 rolls into its fifth decade with 9,000 sales to date. Scouring the archives on the Airbus saga reveals persistent Treasury opposition and sceptical politicians. The lesson is that turning innovation (in this case a brilliant wing design) into solid economic success requires patience. Prof Keith Hayward London • Re the sorry story of Britishvolt, it didn’t have to be like this. In 1977, I brought together a British/Danish team to work on new materials for advanced batteries. We were the first such multinational project to receive EU funding. As part of this, the new materials that made possible the lithium-ion battery were invented by Prof John Goodenough and his team at Oxford. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 2019. I ensured a worldwide patent was taken out by my then employer, the UK Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell. Every battery later made by other companies provided licence and royalty income to the then privatised AEA Technology. This could have been used to create a world-leading advanced battery industry by now. The scientists were ready, but nothing happened. Unsurprisingly, AEA went into administration. Blame City short-termism, not government hot air. Bruce Tofield London • Dave Edgerton’s perceptive article highlights the failings of hi-tech boosterism expounded by successive Tory governments. Yet, to meet today’s challenges on climate change, the left needs to offer a new growth and innovation paradigm. To achieve this, we have to discard the baggage of the industrial era, with its blind defence of producer interests and a supply-side fixation on economically unproven technologies, such as carbon storage, or expensive and risky ones such as nuclear power. Decarbonising the country’s 28m households requires technical innovations combined with new financial models to ensure the transformation is done affordably and at scale. Labour’s green deal has the potential to meet this challenge. But it needs to break from the top-down industrial model and recognise that the decentralised innovation model offers more broad-based regeneration, providing jobs across the country.

But, say experts, the extreme nature of the crisis means carers should look at specialist techniques to help calm anxieties. Mike Hughesman, a former principal educational psychologist for Service Children’s Education who has worked with children whose parents and carers are in active combat in Afghanistan and Germany, said that in acute contexts like these, it is “vital that we source advice on the lived experiences of families that have faced adversity and learned to deal with it successfully. “Too much advice is based on the study of patients who have experienced difficulty and found it hard to cope with adversity,” he said. “Not enough is based on study of the lived experiences of families and individuals that succeed against the odds.” Hughesman recommends solution-focused therapy. “It empowers people to seek out what helps them to succeed, rather than dwell on all the reasons why they haven’t,” he said. In short, he said, parents and carers must deal first with their children’s emotions before calmly exploring the facts as the children themselves see them. The next steps are to help children stay grounded on a day-to-day basis through routines. “Finally,” he said. “We need to find ways to help them be proactive and overcome their sense of powerlessness.” Prof Vivian Hill, programme director at UCL Institute of Education’s department of psychology and human development, warned that fake news on social media can make the situation feel even more frightening and unpredictable than it is already. “It is important to reassure children and talk to them in a way that reflects their age and understanding,” she added. “Don’t overcomplicate things for younger children: stick to the facts. Older children may want to discuss political and historical events. Use reliable sources to support this process. Children are best supported by people they can trust but they may feel too frightened to even ask about this so be sensitive to their mood.” She recommended talking to children about diplomacy, how nobody wants there to be a nuclear attack and everything possible will be done to find a safer way to resolve this conflict. “Try to remain optimistic,” she said. “Keep to routines, do pleasurable and diverting activities with your children.” To remain optimistic, Hill said it was important for parents and carers to be aware of their own feelings and to get support from friends and family. “Some may be able to lean on support from older generations who have lived through the cold war and have direct experiences to draw on,” she said. Judith Wenban-Smith, a forensic psychologist with a special interest in families, advised that it was important to acknowledge to a child how worrying it can be to think about nuclear weapons but that they should be reassured that all countries have nuclear weapons held in very safe ways and are determined not to use them. “Then encourage the child to do something, like join CND, ask for a school assembly on the subject, contribute to a campaign or fundraiser,” she said. “Parents should not dominate the conversation: encourage the child to talk and respond to their worries specifically.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/14/french-nuclear-firm-trying-to-fix-performance-issue-at-china-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-14T11:24:57Z","webTitle":"French nuclear firm trying to fix ‘performance issue’ at China plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/14/french-nuclear-firm-trying-to-fix-performance-issue-at-china-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/14/french-nuclear-firm-trying-to-fix-performance-issue-at-china-plant","fields":{"headline":"French nuclear firm trying to fix ‘performance issue’ at China plant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A French nuclear company has said it is working to resolve a “performance issue” at a plant it part-owns in China’s southern Guangdong province after an earlier report of a potential leak there. Framatome, a subsidiary of the energy giant EDF, told Agence France-Presse news agency that it was “supporting resolution of a performance issue” at the plant. “According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters,” it said, adding that an extraordinary meeting of the power plant’s board had been called “to present all the data and the necessary decisions”. The statement came shortly after the US TV network CNN reported that Framatome had previously warned the US energy department of an “imminent radiological threat” in a letter. According to CNN, the letter included an accusation that the Chinese safety authority was “raising the acceptable limits for radiation detection outside the Taishan nuclear power plant in Guangdong province in order to avoid having to shut it down”. China’s state-run China General Nuclear Power Group said on Sunday that operations at its nuclear power station in south China met safety rules and the surrounding environment was safe. A US official told CNN “the Biden administration believes the facility is not yet at ‘crisis level’”. EDF later said there was an “increase in the concentration of certain noble gases in the primary circuit of reactor No 1” at Taishan, referring to a part of the cooling system. Noble gases are elements like argon, helium and neon, which have low chemical reactivity. Their presence in the system “is a known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures”, EDF said. Radiation levels in Hong Kong, 85 miles from the Taishan plant, were normal on Monday, according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors radiation around the city. Powered up in 2018, the Taishan plant was the first worldwide to operate a next-generation EPR nuclear reactor, a pressurised water design that has been subject to years of delays in similar European projects in Britain, France and Finland. There are now two EPR power units at the plant in the city of Taishan, which sits close to the coastline of southern Guangdong – China’s most populous province. EPR reactors have been touted as promising advances in safety and efficiency over conventional reactors while producing less waste. Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon neutral by 2060. China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generation capacity of 48.75m kilowatts – the world’s third highest after the US and France – and has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector. Last month, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, hailed close ties between their countries as they launched work on Russian-built nuclear power plants in China. And in December, state media reported that China had successfully powered up its “artificial sun” nuclear fusion reactor for the first time, the HL-2M Tokamak reactor, which uses a powerful magnetic field to fuse hot plasma and can reach temperatures of more than 150m C. It is China’s largest and most advanced nuclear fusion experimental research device, and scientists hope the device can potentially unlock a powerful clean energy source.

Here’s a look at the biggest developments throughout the day: UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine. Dozens of Russian missiles were launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” after Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyber-attacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo, addressing a meeting of the council requested by Ukraine, encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. Yashin refused to leave after Putin sent troops to Ukraine on 24 February and regularly took to his YouTube channel, which has 1.3 million subscribers, to condemn his country’s offensive. Yashin insisted in court that he would not flee the country, but the judge extended his detention by six months. I love my country and in order to live here I am ready to pay with my freedom,” he said, adding, “I am a Russian patriot,” Agence France-Presse reports. Prosecutors argued that Yashin should be kept in detention because he had “inflicted considerable damage to Russia” and “increased political tensions during the special military operation” – Russia’s term for its invasion of Ukraine. One of the opposition activist’s lawyers, Vadim Prokhorov, said that extending Yashin’s detention until 10 May was against the law. The next hearing is expected to take place on 29 November. Yashin is an ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and was close to Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. France and Spain on Wednesday lambasted the European Commission’s proposed price cap on wholesale natural gas, set so high that critics have questioned if it would ever be used. Agence France-Presse reports: The EU executive on Tuesday unveiled a gas “safety ceiling” of 275 euros per megawatt hour as the bloc grapples with high energy prices spurred by Moscow’s war in Ukraine and supply cuts. But the conditions meant the cap would only kick in when EU gas prices breach that threshold for two weeks running, calculated on advance purchases through the bloc’s main gas price benchmark, TTF. The cap was also contingent on the TTF price for liquefied natural gas – an easily transportable form of gas that can be shipped worldwide – exceeding 58 euros for 10 days within that same two-week period. The only time the TTF gas price has gone above the 275-euro limit was between August 22 and 29 this year. It was running at around 120 euros in trading on Tuesday. Spanish ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera called the commission’s proposal a “joke”, saying it would cause steeper price hikes and hamper efforts to tame decades-high inflation. The French energy transition ministry criticised an “insufficient” scheme that “does not respond to the reality of the market”. “The commission must propose an operational text, not simply a text that is political grandstanding and may have negative or no effects,” it said. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. He spoke to reporters as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was set to address an urgent meeting of the UN security council later on Wednesday and after the European parliament recognised Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism”. Peskov did not address the symbolic political step of the European legislators. But Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova earlier in the day said on messaging app Telegram: I propose designating the European parliament as a sponsor of idiocy,” she said. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians are facing blackouts as Russian forces bombard key infrastructure. Ukrainians are currently without electricity as a result of Russia’s attacks on critical civilian targeted infrastructure,” Agence France-Presse reported Metsola saying. Dario Nardella, the mayor of Florence, Italy, heads a network of local authorities in Europe and said he was looking to coordinate a group of 200 European cities to send generators they have in storage to Ukraine. We’ve got the potential of sending several hundred, even industrial-sized, generators which will be able to produce quite a lot of power,” Nardella said. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Dozens of Russian missiles were launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday on Russia’s latest strikes at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” and that the country will rebuild damaged infrastructure and “get through all of this”. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure.

In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures in which parts of the capital would have to be evacuated, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the national security and defence council, said. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyber-attacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website.

The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Germany has angrily dismissed claims by Boris Johnson that in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine it said it would be better for Ukraine to fold than to become embroiled in a long war. Johnson, interviewed by CNN, also claimed that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in denial about the threat of invasion, and that Italy, led at the time by Mario Draghi, said it could not help because it was so dependent on Russian hydrocarbons. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update. A German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, rejected Boris Johnson’s claim that Berlin wanted Ukraine to fold and give in to Russia. Hebestreit told reporters: I’m tempted to switch to English and say it’s ‘utter nonsense’ what Boris Johnson said. Taking a swipe at the former prime minister, he added that Johnson has his “own relationship with the truth”. According to the Kyiv mayor, 21 of the 31 cruise missiles fired at the capital were intercepted. One of the 10 which evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of Kyiv, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated just in time after the air raid sirens went off. The blast left a 3 metre crater just in front of the building, destroying the apartments around it, blowing the tops off nearby trees and leaving a children’s playground a charred wreck filled with debris. “It flew right over us. We heard a whistling sound and then it came round down on the building,” Ruslan Vorona, a local resident, said. He and his eight-year-old son, Oleksii, were sheltering and charging their phones in an insulated tent set up by the emergency services. “There were a few explosions. Two were quieter and one was louder, and one of the missiles went straight over my head,” a 28-year-old local man, Oleksandr, who would not give his last name, said. Rescue workers were last night trying to salvage the remaining household possessions of the families left homeless by the blast, tying what they could find in sheets and throwing them to the ground from the four-storey brick building. There was not much left, but the emergency workers had made promises they would save what they could and they risked serious injury clambering through the wreckage to keep their word. The death toll from today’s Russian strikes across Ukraine has risen to seven, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, the head of Kyiv region military administration, said four people had died in the Kyiv region. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least three people had died after the attack on the capital. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head office of Ukraine’s president, said each new Russian attack “only strengthens our character”. The Kremlin “still does not know a damn thing about Ukraine” if it believes that power outages caused by Russian strikes will make Ukrainians “overthrow government and beg for mercy”, Podolyak wrote on Twitter. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting later today on Russia’s latest strikes across Ukraine at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A spokesperson for the US mission to the UN said the US, Albania and Ukraine requested the meeting to discuss “Russia’s massive missile strikes today damaging critical civilian infrastructure across Ukraine”. The meeting is scheduled for 9pm UK time. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: The artillery ammunition, precision fires, air defence missiles, and tactical vehicles that we are providing will best serve Ukraine on the battlefield. The Pentagon said the package included additional munitions for Nasams air defence systems, high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), plus heavy machine guns with thermal imagery sights to counter Russian drones, and more than 20m rounds of small arms ammunition. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Pentagon press secretary, Brig Gen Pat Ryder, said the generators are “intended to support both civilian and military power needs … to ease the pressure on the grid”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked President Joe Biden for the new package and vowed his country “will not be scared by cowardly inhumane terrorist attacks of Russian war criminals”. Two months after mobilising tens of thousands of Russian men, the Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin will grant some of their mothers and wives an audience to quell fears over the mass call-up. But advocates for soldiers’ families have said they were passed over for the meeting and are expecting it to be a whitewash covering up the Kremlin’s disregard for its own soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Valentina Melnikova, a veteran advocate for soldiers’ families going back to 1989, said in an interview with the Guardian that she had not been approached about the meeting with Putin, which is expected to take place later this week. “Of course they didn’t invite us and we of course don’t want to go,” she said. She said it would be one thing to go alone and meet the Russian president as representative of the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee, which she says has received thousands of complaints, more than in the years of the Russian war in Chechnya. But she said that, like other rights activists who have not been chosen to take part in the meeting, she believed the Kremlin would handpick its representatives or perhaps even fill out their ranks with planted audience members, in order to stage Putin’s meeting with the “public”. To go together with the relatives of mobilised [soldiers] who are agreed to their husbands and sons dying on the front is not comfortable for us. We have somewhat different interests and different problems. Read the full story here: The head of Ukraine’s football association, who served on Fifa’s disciplinary body until 2020, has been accused of fraud and money laundering related to the construction of an artificial grass factory. Andriy Pavelko was served with papers by Ukraine’s national police on Tuesday, notifying him that he was suspected of abuse of power and conspiracy to misappropriate and launder funds. When approached by the Guardian, Pavelko, who has been president of the Ukrainian FA (UAF) since 2015, denied any wrongdoing. The UAF issued a statement in which it said that a previous national anti-corruption agency investigation had cleared Pavelko and other individuals. They accused pro-Russian forces of being behind the current investigation. The statement said: The real reason for the criminal pressure on the leadership of the UAF is the attempt of pro-Russian politicians to force the association to stop the fight against the Russian Federation, as well as to block the process of Ukraine’s preparation to participate in the role of organiser in the 2030 World Cup. Pavelko, who has been president of the Ukrainian FA since 2015, was photographed with his face covered as he emerged from the public prosecutor’s office in Kyiv on Tuesday. A leaked police document said Pavelko was suspected of “taking possession of someone else’s property by abuse of his official position as an official, committed on a particularly large scale by prior collusion by a group of persons”. Read the full story here: Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Ukrainian defence forces shot down 51 of the Russian cruise missiles launched across the country today, as well as five attack drones, according to the top general Valeriy Zaluzhniy. A total of 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were downed by defence forces, according to the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” after new Russian strikes across the country. Ukraine will rebuild infrastructure damaged by today’s attacks and “get through all of this”, he said in a video address posted to Telegram. Zelenskiy said: Today, the European parliament recognised Russia as a terrorist state … And then Russia proved that all this is true by using 67 missiles against our infrastructure, our energy grid, and ordinary people. He also said Ukraine will request an urgent meeting of the UN’s security council to discuss the latest Russian strikes against power-generating facilities. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. Parts of the capital would have to be evacuated in this scenario, he said. Klitschko said: We must also prepare for the worst scenario. That would be if there were widespread power cuts and the temperatures were even colder. Then parts of the city would have to be evacuated, but we don’t want it to come to that. He accused Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, of trying to intimate people and force them out of the city by ordering shelling on civilian infrastructure. He said: Putin wants to terrorise people, make them freeze, without light. But that won’t happen. My impression is that people will only get angrier, more determined. We will not die or flee as Putin wants. The head of the National Police of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said six people were killed and 36 wounded following a fresh wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine. The actual number of casualties is expected to be higher, he added. The number of people injured in today’s missile attack in Kyiv has risen to nine, according to its mayor Vitali Klitschko. Three people were killed, he said. The International Rescue Committee has condemned an overnight Russian rocket attack that struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby. In a statement, the IRC’s vice president for emergencies, Bob Kitchen, said this morning’s attack on the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, was part of a “dangerous global trend of increasing attacks on health in conflict”. He said: The tragic images of rescuers working at the site of a maternity ward we saw this morning illustrate that women and children continue to pay the highest price for this war. No child should be born under a barrage of missile strikes. No child should die buried in rubble remaining from hospitals, where their mothers seek safety and protection. Health facilities are protected under international law and should be “safe havens in times of crisis and conflict”, he added. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, has shared an image of 36 of his country’s servicemen who have returned after being held captive in Russia. Among those who were returned in a prisoner-of-war exchange with Russia were fighters at the Azovstal steelworks of the southern port city of Mariupol, he added. Here are some of the images we have received from the aftermath of the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine today. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Energoatom added: Currently, they (power units) work in project mode, without generation into the domestic energy system. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, has confirmed that it came under “sophisticated cyberattacks, hours after MEPs voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. A pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website, she said. She added that IT experts were “pushing back” against the cyberattack and protecting their systems. She added: My response: #SlavaUkraini Boris Johnson’s claim that Germany wanted Ukraine to quickly “fold” after Russia’s invasion has been dismissed as “utter nonsense” by Berlin. PA media reports: The former prime minister, who was in office when Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded in February, said Germany wanted Ukraine to quickly lose, rather than have a lengthy war, for “all sorts of sound economic reasons”. But German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, on Wednesday sharply refuted his comment. “We know that the very entertaining former prime minister always has a unique relationship with the truth; this case is no exception,” he said, according to German media. Berlin swiftly decided to send arms to Ukraine after Moscow launched its invasion, chancellor Olaf Scholz’s spokesperson said, noting the “facts speak against [Johnson’s] claims”. Switching to English, Hebestreit added: “This is utter nonsense.” Germany’s ambassador to the UK tweeted the official’s rejection of Mr Johnson’s claim, which will not have helped UK-German relations. Johnson earlier told US broadcaster CNN: “The Germans, for all sorts of sound economic reasons, really didn’t want it to … I’ll tell you a terrible thing – the German view was at one stage that if it were going to happen, which would be a disaster, then it would be better for the whole thing to be over quickly and for Ukraine to fold. “I couldn’t support that. I thought that was a disastrous way of looking at it, but I could understand why they thought and felt as they did.” The ex-PM also said France was in denial “right up until the last moment” when Russian forces crossed the border. “This thing was a huge shock. We could see the Russian battalion tactical groups amassing but different countries had very different perspectives,” he said. “Be in no doubt that the French were in denial right up until the last moment.” This is from Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK. For more live updates from the UK, do follow my colleague Andy Sparrow’s UK politics blog. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Dozens of Russian missiles were reportedly launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country as Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, urged people to stay in shelters. At least three people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and six injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according officials. Three people have died and at least 11 injured from the strikes, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” following Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, reported that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. “Everything is fine with the station. There is nowhere to generate electricity,” a spokesperson said. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said. The European parliament was hit by a cyber-attack, officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The European parliament was hit by a cyberattack, officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Jaume Duch, a spokesperson for the EU parliament said its website was down due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack. Russia’s defence ministry said 35 prisoners of war who had been held captive in Ukraine were returned after talks. In a statement, it said: On November 23, as a result of the negotiation process, 35 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, who were in mortal danger in captivity. The servicemen will be transported by air to Moscow “for treatment and rehabilitation at medical institutions of the Russian defence ministry”, it said. They will be given medical and psychological assistance, it added. A 17-year-old girl is among those killed in Russian airstrikes on Kyiv this afternoon, mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Three people have died and at least 11 injured from the strikes, he said. A top Ukrainian security official has said that suspected Russian citizens and cash documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said there was an ongoing investigation into what had been going on in the network of catacombs. The SBU website said the agency had found pro-Russian literature, over $100,000 in cash, and “dubious” Russian citizens. “We are not going to talk about money right now,” Danilov told the Guardian. There’s certain documents were found there. And certain citizens were found there … most likely citizens of the Russian federation. And now we’re trying to find out what they do in there and why they were there. Located south of the city centre, the sprawling Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – is the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church that falls under the Moscow patriarchate, as well as being a Ukrainian cultural treasure and a Unesco world heritage site. The raid on Pechersk Lavra was part of a broad sweep of the church’s property. The SBU said in all, about 850 people had their identities checked and 50 underwent “in-depth counterintelligence interviews”, including with the use of a polygraph. More than 350 church buildings were searched including two other monasteries and the headquarters of the Moscow patriarchate’s diocese in western Ukraine, the agency said. Read the full story by my colleagues Julian Borger and Lorenzo Tondo here: Rescuers work at a site of a Russian missile strike, amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv today. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, says he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned after strikes on Ukraine left his country “in the dark, again”. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light”. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has reported that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. An Energoatom spokesperson said: Everything is fine with the station. There is nowhere to generate electricity. At least three people have been killed and six injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to the city administration. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s air strikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, also reported on Telegram that the city’s water supply had been cut off. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has said Russia is trying to “punish Ukraine for daring to be free” by launching “cruel” new strikes across the country. America will stand with Ukraine, she said. Andrei Spînu, Moldova’s deputy prime minister, has reported “massive” power outages in his country following Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for his country to get “all necessary air defence systems ASAP” after fresh Russian strikes across Ukraine. Moscow launched “new missile terror” against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to “celebrate” the European parliament’s recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, Kuleba said on Twitter. Authorities in Kyiv said at least one person was killed by the latest Russian attack on the capital. Another person was also injured by the strike, which damaged a two-storey building, according to the city’s military government. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo reports for us from Kyiv: According to preliminary information, in the Kyiv region, Russian strikes hit a residential area and critical infrastructure objects, said Ukrainian authorities. Explosions were also heard in Lviv and Kremenchuk, in the Poltava oblast. Power outages have been reported across Ukraine. An air raid alert was issued across Ukraine and Ukrainian media carried reports of air defence systems in action in several parts of the country. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Guardian correspondents in Kyiv heard several explosions. Emergency power outages began in Kyiv, a local energy provider said. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: (Missiles) Hit one of the capital’s infrastructure facilities. Stay in shelters! The air alert continues. He gave no details of what infrastructure was hit. But Russian forces have increasingly targeted Ukrainian critical infrastructure in recent weeks as they faced setbacks on the battlefield following their 24 February invasion. At least one person has been injured by the latest Russian attack on Kyiv, according to the city’s military administration. Russia has launched new missile strikes on Ukraine, hitting at least one critical infrastructure target in Kyiv with explosions heard echoing across the capital. An air raid alert was issued across the country. Ukrainian media reported air defence systems in action in several parts of the country. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the southern Mykolaiv oblast, said Russian forces had launched five missiles in the region. Explosions have also been reported in Lviv. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head office of Ukraine’s president, said a new “massive attack” on the country’s infrastructure facilities was under way. Emergency power outages began in Kyiv, a local energy provider said. Lviv’s mayor has also reported power outages in the whole of the city. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo reports from Kyiv: A series of explosions were heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago, as Russia has unleashed another wave of rockets across Ukraine. Explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Some impacts have been reported. Ukraine’s air defence took out some of them. Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed a strike on critical infrastructure. Explosions followed by power outages. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared a video showing a Russian rocket flying over Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Post’s Jason Jay Smart has also posted a video reportedly showing missiles flying over Dnipro in central Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko writes that a Russian missile has just been heard over Bucha, in Kyiv Oblast. An air raid alert has been issued across almost all of Ukraine, according to reports. Officials in at least two Ukrainian regions said local air defences were in operation against Russian missiles, according to Reuters. A large number of Russian cruise missiles have been reported heading towards Kyiv, a Ukrainian military source has told Jimmy Rushton, a freelance security and foreign policy analyst. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine and called on democracies around the world to follow suit. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament said Russia was “a terrorist regime as a consequence of its deliberate physical destruction of civilian infrastructure and mass murder of Ukrainian civilians with the aim of eliminating the Ukrainian people”. It urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. The vote was passed by 494 MEPs, with 58 votes against and 44 abstentions. The parliament, which often takes bold foreign policy stances, cannot compel EU governments or the European Commission to follow its policy recommendations, which include changing EU law to allow states to be designated as a sponsor or perpetrator of terrorism. MEPs say this legal step would allow the EU to widen its sanctions against Russia, to target its political, legislative, military and executive bodies as well as holding it responsible for the crime of military aggression. MEPs have also called for Russia to be excluded from the UN security council. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the EU has adopted sanctions against 1,241 individuals and 118 organisations, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, his leading ministers and allies, many Russian oligarchs and Russian Duma deputies. Five EU countries - Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states - have already declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, while the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe - which is not part of the EU - has also declared the current Russian regime “a terrorist one”. The resolution listed Russia’s “terrorist acts”, including supplying weapons to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and deliberate atttacks on Syrian civilians; the poisoning of the Skripals and the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, which killed 298 people. In Ukraine, the resolution said that Ukrainian authorities had documented more than 34,000 war crimes committed by Russian and proxy troops. More than 90 % of these attacks were against civilian population and, or are with the aim of destroying civilian facilities. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed the decision by the European parliament to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Russia must be “isolated at all levels” so that it will “end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe”, he urged. Air raid alerts have been heard across all of Ukraine amid reports of explosions in southern and eastern regions of the country, according to Reuters. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, said Russia had launched another rocket attack and urged people to stay in shelters. More to follow. The European parliament has voted to designate Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism”. In a largely symbolic vote, MEPs argued that Russia’s military strikes on civilian targets such as energy infrastructure, hospitals, schools and shelters violate international law. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said he was grateful to the European parliament for this “crucial step which strengthens the international isolation of Russia and rightfully confirms its pariah status” The European parliament’s vice-president, Dita Charanzová, called for President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for his crimes. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: An overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby, Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday. The child’s mother and a doctor were pulled alive from the rubble. The region’s governor said the rockets were Russian, AP reported. The strike in the city of Vilniansk adds to the gruesome toll suffered by hospitals and other medical facilities – and their patients and staff – in the Russian invasion entering its tenth month this week. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced, in an escalation of support for Kyiv’s resistance against Vladimir Putin. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. They are the first piloted aircraft to be sent by the UK since the Russian invasion began in February. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding an old Orthodox Christian Monastery in Kyiv. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services,” the SBU said. Special “invincibility centres” will be set up around Ukraine to provide electricity, heat, water, internet, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. Russian attacks have knocked out power for long periods for up to 10 million consumers at a time. Ukraine’s national power grid operator said on Tuesday the damage had been colossal. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has come under pressure to apologise after posting a video of himself at a football match wearing a scarf that depicted historical Hungary, including parts of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Tuesday Kyiv would summon Hungary’s ambassador “who will be informed of the unacceptability of Viktor Orbán’s act”. Moldova will pay for gas withheld in Ukraine, Moldova’s deputy prime minister Andrei Spinu said on Wednesday. Accusing Ukraine of keeping volumes of gas that were destined for Moldova, Gazprom said it could start reducing gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine from 28 November. The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. I’ll be back in a few hours but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced, in an escalation of support for Kyiv’s resistance against Vladimir Putin. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. They are the first piloted aircraft to be sent by the UK since the Russian invasion began in February. “Our support for Ukraine is unwavering. These additional artillery rounds will help Ukraine to secure the land it has reclaimed from Russia in recent weeks,” Wallace said during a visit to Norway. The defence secretary also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Pope Francis said on Wednesday that Ukrainians today were suffering from the “martyrdom of aggression” and compared the war to the “terrible genocide” of the 1930s, when Soviet leader Joseph Stalin inflicted famine on the people there. He was speaking at the end of his general audience before thousands of people in St Peter’s Square. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the plant in recent months that has damaged buildings and knocked out power lines supplying the plant that are crucial to cooling the six reactors’ fuel and avoiding a nuclear meltdown. “IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi met a Russian delegation led by Rosatom DG Alexey Likhachev in Istanbul today, for consultations on operational aspects related to safety at #Zaporizhzhya NPP in Ukraine &amp; on urgently establishing a nuclear safety &amp; security protection zone,” the IAEA tweeted. Grossi has been warning for months of the risk of a potentially catastrophic accident because of the shelling. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times. An overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby, Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday. The child’s mother and a doctor were pulled alive from the rubble. The region’s governor said the rockets were Russian, AP reported. The strike in the city of Vilniansk adds to the gruesome toll suffered by hospitals and other medical facilities – and their patients and staff – in the Russian invasion entering its tenth month this week. They have been in the line of fire from the outset, including a 9 March airstrike that destroyed a maternity hospital in the now-occupied port city of Mariupol. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding an old Orthodox Christian Monastery in Kyiv. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services,” the SBU said. The site is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church that falls under the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. The foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said there was no justification for the raid and compared the “Kyiv regime” to Bacchus, the Roman god of wine whose name is often associated in Russian with immoral mayhem, chaos and revelry. “This is just some kind of total godless Bacchanalia. There is no justification or explanation for this. And there cannot be,” Zakharova said on Sputnik radio. “This is another part of the absolutely immoral and wild actions of the Kyiv regime.” Russia’s Orthodox church said on Tuesday the search was an “act of intimidation”. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The Russian attacks have been a combination of UAVs and traditional reusable armed systems, it added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the rest of the day’s news. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has come under pressure to apologise after posting a video of himself at a football match wearing a scarf that depicted historical Hungary, including parts of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Tuesday Kyiv would summon Hungary’s ambassador “who will be informed of the unacceptability of Viktor Orbán’s act”. “The promotion of revisionism ideas in Hungary does not contribute to the development of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations and does not comply with the principles of European policy,” Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. “We are waiting for an official apology from the Hungarian side and a refutation of the encroachments on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Ukraine, Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia. Romania’s foreign ministry also responded angrily, saying it had submitted to the Hungarian ambassador in Bucharest its “firm disapproval of the gesture: Special “invincibility centres” will be set up around Ukraine to provide electricity, heat, water, internet, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. Russian attacks have knocked out power for long periods for up to 10 million consumers at a time. Ukraine’s national power grid operator said on Tuesday the damage had been colossal. “If massive Russian strikes happen again and it’s clear power will not be restored for hours, the ‘invincibility centres’ will go into action with all key services,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this week that 8,500 power generator sets are being imported to Ukraine daily. The first snow of the winter has fallen in much of the country over the past week. Authorities have warned of power cuts that could affect millions of people to the end of March – the latest impact from Russia’s nine-month invasion that has already killed tens of thousands, uprooted millions and pummelled the global economy. Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities follow a series of battlefield setbacks that have included a retreat of its forces from the southern city of Kherson to the east bank of the Dnipro River that bisects the country. The Ministry of Defence has announced it will send helicopters to Ukraine for the first time since the war began. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said it will be the first time piloted aircraft were sent to the war-torn nation since Russia’s invasion. According to the BBC, three former Sea King helicopters will be provided. The first of which has already arrived in Ukraine. Wallace, who made the announcement from Oslo where he is meeting allies to discuss ongoing military support for Kyiv, added that the UK will also send an additional 10,000 artillery rounds. It comes after Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, used a visit to the Ukrainian capital to set out a new 50m package of defence aid which included 125 anti-aircraft guns and equipment to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Moldova will pay for gas withheld in Ukraine, Moldova’s deputy prime Minister Andrei Spinu said on Wednesday. Accusing Ukraine of keeping volumes of gas that were destined for Moldova, Gazprom said it could start reducing gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine from 28 November. “Gazprom accuses Ukraine and Moldova of something that is not happening. All gas supplied to the right bank of Moldova will be paid by Moldova,” Spinu said on messaging app Telegram.” Here are photos of the aftermath of the attack, posted by Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Staruk, via the Kyiv Independent: Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram in the early hours of Wednesday morning that a Russian missile strike on a maternity ward in the Zaporizhzhia oblast city of Vilniansk has killed a newborn baby. “Grief fills our hearts,” he said. Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram in the early hours of Wednesday morning that a Russian missile strike on a maternity ward in the Zaporizhzhia oblast city of Vilniansk has killed a newborn baby. “Grief fills our hearts,” he said. The Guardian has not been able to verify the claim independently, but if true, it would not be the first strike by Russian forces on maternity wards in Ukraine. In March, Russian bombs destroyed a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol, killing three people and injuring 17. A pregnant woman who was in the hospital when it was attacked died later, after being taken to another hospital, as did her baby. We’ll have more on the strike in Zaporizhzhia as it comes in. In the mean time, here are the other key recent developments: The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians needing basic services if Russia knocks out power stations and other facilities this winter can turn to special “invincibility centres,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Thousands of centres spread across the country will offer electricity, heat, water, internet service, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Kyiv will summon the Hungarian ambassador to protest that prime minister Viktor Orbán went to a football match wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda said depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T00:17:53Z","webTitle":"Poland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without German approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","fields":{"headline":"Poland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without German approval","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Polish prime minister has said his country would be willing to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine without securing Germany’s approval if Berlin does not agree to their re-export at Friday’s meeting of western defence ministers at Ramstein airbase. Mateusz Morawiecki said in a radio interview on Thursday that “consent was of secondary importance” when it came to German-made tanks, because the key issue was to get military aid to Ukraine urgently. “We will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do it ourselves,” Morawiecki added, heaping further pressure on Berlin to allow German made Leopard 2s to be sent to Ukraine in preparation for a spring offensive. His comments came as the US Defense Department formally announced new military assistance for Ukraine valued at up to $2.5bn, including armoured vehicles and support for Ukraine’s air defence. The aid includes 59 Bradley fighting vehicles and 90 Stryker armoured personnel carriers, but not Abrams tanks. Poland, along with Finland, has said it wants to give 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, which would normally require German approval, but it is one of a number of countries trying to force the pace at a time when Berlin is still negotiating. Arvydas Anusauskas, Lithuania’s defence minister, said others could follow suit at the Ramstein meeting on Friday. “Some of the countries will definitely send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, that is for sure,” he said. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, met his newly appointed German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, in Berlin on Thursday, but neither mentioned the Leopard standoff in brief commentsbefore their meeting. Previously, German officials signalled Berlin was willing to break the logjam if the US would also agree to send over some of its own Abrams tanks to Ukraine. But the US said on Wednesday it did not want to do that, because the Abrams, which has a jet turbine engine, is fuel inefficient and so requires complex logistics support. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, said: “The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It’s expensive, it’s hard to train on, it has a jet engine – I think it’s about three gallons to the mile with jet fuel. It is not the easiest system to maintain.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said for the second time in two days there was little time to be wasted wrestling with decisions. Speaking by video link at a special event at the Davos gathering of the global elite, he said: “This is not a cinema where you wait for the film to start.” Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, however, warned that if Russia was to be defeated in a conventional war in Ukraine, it could lead to nuclear war. “The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war,” he wrote, adding: “Nuclear powers have never lost major conflicts on which their fate depends.” Few believe such rhetoric should be taken at face value, Russian nuclear messaging is usually designed to intimidate or provoke anxiety in the west just as leaders weigh up how much military aid to provide to Ukraine this week. But there was little sign of hesitation among many western nations, putting the focus squarely on Germany. Britain, which has already said it will supply 14 of its own Challenger 2 tanks, said it would provide an extra 600 Brimstone anti-tank missiles, at a pre-meeting of nine countries in Estonia. “We’re in it for the long haul,” said Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary. The grouping, which includes Poland and the Baltic states as well as Britain, released a joint pledge declaring: “We commit to collectively pursuing delivery of an unprecedented set of donations including main battle tanks, heavy artillery, air defence, ammunition, and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine’s defence.” Estonia announced a military aid package worth €113m and said the total value of its support was more than 1% of its GDP in the period since the war began. Sweden said it would donate 50 Type 90 infantry fighting vehicles and Archer artillery. Denmark announced it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzers. France, too, hinted it might consider sending its Leclerc tanks to Ukraine as part of an arrangement with Germany. “The subject is complicated and hasn’t been settled yet in Paris. But we are thinking about it,” a French official told Politico. It could be discussed at a joint Franco-German cabinet on Sunday, they suggested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T17:20:19Z","webTitle":"Starmer calls on Tories to sack co-chair Ben Elliot over party links to Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","fields":{"headline":"Starmer calls on Tories to sack co-chair Ben Elliot over party links to Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has called on the Conservatives to sack their co-chair, Ben Elliot, for being “at the heart” of links between the party and Russian money. The Labour leader said Elliot should step back from his role or be removed after revelations about his firm’s Russian business and the Tories accepting donations from wealthy Russians or companies linked to Russia. Elliot has been chair of the party while it has taken donations from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Putin’s former finance minister, and Aquind, a company co-owned by the billionaire Viktor Fedotov. Neither is subject to any sanctions and the Conservatives have previously said in relation to Chernukhin and Aquind that all donations were “properly and transparently” declared in line with electoral law. Chernukhin, who has British citizenship, has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called Putin’s regime “despotic”. Elliot is also co-owner of Quintessentially, a “concierge” service for the super-wealthy that has counted many Russians among its clients, including reportedly Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner who has also faced calls from Starmer for UK sanctions to be imposed on him. Quintessentially this week deleted a webpage detailing its presence in Russia, with about 50 staff in the country. An archived page version said: “Quintessentially Russia has nearly 15 years’ experience providing luxury lifestyle management services to Russia’s elite and corporate members. Our office employs over 50 lifestyle managers, each of whom has completed a specialised training programme. They work around the clock 365 days per year to provide personal concierge services to each member. From restaurant bookings to backstage concert access, a bespoke luxury lifestyle is at our clients’ fingertips.” A spokesperson for Quintessentially said the group “completely condemns President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine” and was monitoring its member base to ensure it was not servicing any individual or corporate body on sanctions lists, confirming that there were none so far. With concerns heightened after the invasion of Ukraine, Starmer said it was time for the Conservatives to act to remove Elliot. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington, where Labour won a byelection on Thursday, Starmer said: “I think there is growing concern about the links between the Conservative party and Russian money. Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. “There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. “So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it.” A Conservative source said: “This Conservative government has been leading the world in arming and training Ukrainian troops and imposing severe sanctions on Russia while Keir Starmer attempts to score cheap political points.” In a reference to a row over support for Stop the War, the source added: “He would be better off trying to rid his own party of the Putin apologists who blame Nato for the invasion of Ukraine, many of whom sit as Labour MPs.” Abramovich has said he is a non-political person and was not linked to Putin or the Russian state. Meanwhile the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith called for British politics to be “scrubbed clean” of Russian money, saying: “It’s all political parties: we’ve all got to clean house … I think it should all be revisited, all of what went on in the past.” Duncan Smith suggested it was not just politicians who had been too lax about accepting Russian cash but also “lawyers, estate agents, accountants – enablers” who should now reconsider their roles. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, called on the government to use legislation due to be passed next week to force UK citizens to sever their links with Russian companies if the government believed they were connected to the Kremlin. “We are in an economic war,” he said. “One of the things we should do in the economic crime bill is that we should require British citizens not to hold posts on the boards of companies which the government believes have a link with Putin. They should certainly not be in receipt of large sums of money from such companies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T17:15:56Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: risk of radioactive leak at ‘repeatedly shelled’ Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, operator warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: risk of radioactive leak at ‘repeatedly shelled’ Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, operator warns – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Concern about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is persisting. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned that there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the area around Europe’s largest nuclear plant. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the nuclear plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops will “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall had secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, the country’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members will be allowed to leave the country so long as they have permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. UK organisations have been urged to strengthen their cyber defences to prepare for an extended period of “heightened threat” due to the war in Ukraine. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) published the guidance along with advice to help companies bolster their protections. Paul Maddinson, NCSC director for national resilience and strategy, said: “From the start of the conflict in Ukraine, we have been asking organisations to strengthen their cyber defences to help keep the UK secure, and many have done so. “But it’s now clear that we’re in this for the long haul, and it’s vital that organisations support their staff through this demanding period of heightened cyber threat.” The UK is giving underwater drones to Ukraine and training Ukrainian personnel in Britain to use them to clear their coastline of mines, the Ministry of Defence has announced. Dozens of Ukrainian personnel will be taught to use the autonomous minehunting vehicles by the Royal Navy and US partners over the coming months, with some already commencing their training. Six autonomous minehunting vehicles are being sent to search for Russian mines in the waters off its coast. Three vehicles are due to be sent from UK stocks while another three will be bought from industry. The lightweight autonomous vehicles can be used in shallow coastal environments and are designed to operate at depths of up to 100 metres to detect, locate and identify mines with a series of sensors. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. The former Soviet republic – which also has active economic ties with Kyiv – has avoided taking sides in the Ukrainian crisis while calling for its peaceful resolution. The country’s government did not give a reason in Saturday’s statement for the decision to halt arms exports, Reuters reports. Kazakhstan produces a wide range of military equipment including boats, armoured and artillery vehicles, machine guns, night visors, grenades, torpedoes and protective gear. The government has not said these items were being exported. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. The agreement is due to come into effect at the beginning of September and will last a year and a half, the defence ministers of the countries agreed at a meeting during the Slovak International Air Fest. Slovakia has expressed a willingness to transfer the grounded planes to Ukraine but the defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said no deal had been reached with Kyiv. Nad said: “The possibility is on the table, and once there is an agreement we will inform you.” The woods outside Chernihiv were quiet in late August when Anatoliy Pavelko scrambled into a 10-metre bomb crater with a trowel and an icebox full of sample jars. He wanted to find out what the Russian FAB-250 bomb left behind when it carved this gaping hole into the ground in the spring. Four months earlier, the environmental lawyer was dug in on a frontline just a few kilometres away, shells crashing around him in the bitter fight to keep Russian forces out of Kyiv. Now he has taken temporary leave from his unit of volunteers and returned to Chernihiv for a more familiar battle on a different front in the war against Moscow. Russia’s invasion has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and destroyed homes and entire cities. It is also devastating Ukraine’s environment, an “ecocide” that activists worry is going largely unrecorded amid the broader national tragedy. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Concern about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is persisting. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned that there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant.

A Russian rocket hit Kharkiv’s historic district in the early hours of Saturday, leaving one person injured, according to police. The rocket damaged nearby buildings, leaving a large crater in the road. A local police officer told Reuters: There are no military objects, no military equipment. Only residential buildings with regular citizens near the place of impact. Tetiana Zviahintseva, a local shopkeeper who was sweeping scattered shards of broken glass in her store, said: Horror and nightmare – they [Russians] torture our city. The endless shelling exhausted everybody. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has issued a statement marking the country’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops will “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. On Telegram, the Ukrainian leader posted a series of photos dedicated to the country’s air force and vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Zelenskiy said: Ukrainian soldiers will destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step, and the day will come when the enemy will perish in Zaporizhzhia, in the south, in the east of the country, and in Crimea. The invaders will die like dew on the sun, and our defence is and will be this sun. Happy Ukraine Aviation Day! • This post was amended on 30 August 2022 to provide a link to President Zelenskiy’s statement on Telegram. Ukraine’s military command said its forces have beaten back assaults by Russian forces around Soledar, Zaitseve and Mayorsk in the Donetsk region. Ukraine’s southern military command reported that a Ukrainian air strike destroyed a Russian air defence system in the Kherson region, while the Antonovsky and Daryivskiy bridges remained unusable by heavy vehicles after previous strikes, Reuters reports. In its daily briefing the Russian defence ministry said it had destroyed a large ammunition depot in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region that had contained US-made Himars rocket systems and shells for M777 howitzers, Reuters reports. The Russian air force also claims to have shot down a MiG-29 aircraft in the eastern Donetsk region and to have destroyed another six missile and artillery weapons depots in the Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. Reuters reports two South Korean companies have signed a $5.76bn contract with Poland to export tanks and howitzers, Seoul’s arms procurement agency said. This comes after Warsaw agreed to ramp up arms imports amid tensions with Russia. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, the Kyiv Independent reports. The cabinet of ministers of Ukraine has announced that sailors will be allowed to travel abroad for work. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members will be allowed to leave the country so long as they have permission to cross the border from their local conscription offices. Until now, men aged 18 to 60 who were capable of military service were not allowed to travel outside Ukraine. According to Shmyhal, more than 100,000 Ukrainians work in the shipping industry Ukrainian sailors have been working to encourage the authorities to release them to work abroad, with some sailors recording videos with their wives and children with messages for Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, requesting the right to work overseas. From 1 September, sailors will be allowed to leave Ukraine for business trips for up to seven days. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned that there is a risk of a radioactive leak at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the nuclear plant over the past day, Energoatom said. As of midday on Saturday local time (9am GMT) the plant “operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards”, the operator said in a statement. Energoatom said: As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. Hungary has issued regulatory approval for the construction of two new nuclear reactors by the Russian state-owned company Rosatom, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, announced yesterday. The £10.6bn construction of two nuclear reactors will begin in the coming weeks, as part of a 2014 deal between Moscow and Budapest aimed at expanding Hungary’s existing Paks nuclear plant. Szijjártó said on Facebook: This is a big step, an important milestone. We can now move from planning stage to construction. You’ll see that at the Paks site in the coming weeks. He added it is “realistic” that the new reactors could enter service by 2030. Russia’s nuclear industry has not been included in EU sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, and the fact that the construction is moving forward has been seen as another sign of the close ties between Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, has claimed Russian forces shelled the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant complex in southern Ukraine. In a statement, Energoatom said: Over the last [24 hours], Russian troops again shelled the grounds of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The damage is currently being ascertained. Russia’s defence ministry earlier accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the nuclear plant complex three times in the last 24 hours. It is not possible to verify either side’s claims. On Friday, Energoatom said Ukrainian technicians had managed to partly reconnect the Zaporizhzhia plant to its grid under the gaze of occupying forces. The situation, however, remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. My colleague Shaun Walker has been reporting on the propaganda drive in Russian-occupied Kherson that Russia hopes will help cement its hold over the southern Ukrainian city. Russian authorities have resurrected the Soviet-era newspaper Naddnepryanskaya Pravda, which now claims to have a print run of 250,000. The newspaper’s content gives a good insight into the propaganda priorities for the Russian administration, Shaun writes. There are repeated articles promising residents increased benefits, pensions and more work opportunities. There are repeated claims of the “overwhelming desire” of Kherson residents to hold a referendum to join Russia, but there are also plenty of threats. One front page article warns of “tough measures” against those who threaten public order, indicating that speaking out against Russian rule is now considered to be against the law. Here’s some more detail on the British defence ministry’s announcement that it is donating undersea minehunter drones to help Ukraine clear its coastline. Six autonomous minehunting vehicles will be sent to the country to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coast, the ministry said. Three of these drones will be provided from the UK’s own stocks, with a further three to be purchased from industry. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. The first tranche have already begun their training, it added. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said in a statement: Russia’s cynical attempts to hold the world’s food supply to ransom must not be allowed to succeed. This vital equipment and training will help Ukraine make their waters safe, helping to smooth the flow of grain to the rest of the world and supporting the armed forces of Ukraine as they look to defend their coastline and ports. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. Britain will also train dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel to use the drones, the ministry said in a statement. A US citizen has recently died in Ukraine, according to a state department spokesperson. Officials are in touch with the family and are providing consular assistance, they added. The spokesperson added: We also once again reiterate US citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that US citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options. Two civilians have been killed and 12 others injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, according to officials. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor, wrote on Facebook: On August 26, Russians killed two civilians in Donetsk region – in Bakhmut. Twelve people were injured. Note: It has not been possible to independently verify this information. Russia has blocked an agreement at the United Nations that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) because Moscow objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine. The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russia’s refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine’s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its “protectors”, calling the negotiations a “one-sided game”. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. Read the full article here. French energy firm TotalEnergies says it is divesting its stake in a Russian gas field that was reported this week to be providing fuel that ends up in Russian fighter jets. The company said it had signed a deal on Friday with its local Russian partner, Novatek, to sell its 49% in the Termokarstovoye gas field “on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field”. Agence France-Presse reported it saying Russian authorities approved the divestment on 25 August. That was the day after an article appeared in French daily Le Monde reporting on the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia’s assault on Ukraine since February. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has stressed the need to boost security along the alliance’s northern flank to counter Russia, as he concluded a visit to Canada that included a tour of its Arctic defences. “The high north is strategically important for Euro-Atlantic security,” Agence France Presse reported Stoltenberg as telling a news conference at an air base in Alberta. With Finland and Sweden joining Nato, he noted, seven of eight Arctic states would be members. Referring to the North American aerospace defence command (Norad), a US-Canadian organisation, Stoltenberg said: The shortest path to North America for Russian missiles and bombers would be over the North Pole. This makes Norad’s role vital for North America and therefore also for Nato. Stoltenberg said Russia’s capabilities in the far north “are a strategic challenge for the whole alliance”, citing a significant Russian military buildup in the region. That included the reopening of “hundreds of new and former Soviet-era Arctic military sites” and its use of the high north “as a testbed for the most advanced weapons including hypersonic missiles”. The Nato chief also expressed concerns about China’s reach into the Arctic for shipping and resources exploration, with plans to build the world’s largest icebreaker fleet. Beijing and Moscow have pledged to intensify practical cooperation in the Arctic. This forms part of the deepening strategic partnership that challenges our values and our interests. The governor of the Donetsk region says three-quarters of its population has been evacuated amid Russian assaults in Ukraine’s east. Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian TV: There is practically not a single major town or city that is not subject to [Russian] shelling. Reuters also reported the Ukrainian military general staff as saying Russian aircraft had attacked several sites and was focusing on more than a dozen towns in the south, including Mykolaiv near the Black Sea. There were also air strikes against several towns in the Sumy region near the Russian border, the general staff said, and Russian forces had shelled and carried out air attacks against the Kharkiv region in the north-east. Also on Friday, Washington confirmed reports that a US citizen had recently died in Ukraine, but declined to provide further details. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall had secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. It adds: There is a realistic possibility that Russia has increased its efforts in the Donbas in an attempt to draw in or fix additional Ukrainian units, amid speculation that Ukraine is planning a major counter-offensive. Ukraine suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russian troops in 2014. Washington warned on Thursday against such a move, with State Department spokesman Vedant Patel saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas were “unacceptable”. The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine. Agence France-Presse also reported that Britain’s defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the occupied power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60m (200 feet) of one reactor. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here are the latest developments as it has just passed 9am in Kyiv on this Saturday 27 August 2022. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained “very risky” after two of its six reactors were reconnected to the grid following shelling that caused Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to be disconnected for the first time in its history. “Let me stress that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,” he said in his regular evening address on Friday, praising Ukrainian experts working to “avert the worst-case scenario”. Residents near the Zaporizhzhia plant have reportedly been given iodine tablets amid mounting fears that the fighting around the Russian-occupied complex in south-eastern Ukraine could trigger a catastrophe. Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around it. A team of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s frontlines. Speaking on national television, she said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region, and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy Bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, said in a French television interview on Friday that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions, but warned Moscow would not stop its assault until its goals had been achieved. “Renouncing [Ukraine’s] participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace,” Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive had stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Alexander Lukashenko said he had previously agreed to the move with his Russian counterpart, Putin, and warned that his country was ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%.
