                "DB-DC Happy hump day! Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating was taking no prisoners today, blasting the Aukus submarine deal as “the worst international decision” taken by a Labor government in a century. “Look, I’d say for the cost – $360bn – for $360bn, we’re going to get eight submarines. It must be the worst deal in all history,” he said in a blistering appearance at the National Press Club where he insulted journalists and chided his Labor colleagues for “essentially [accommodating] the strategic wishes of the United States, uncritically”. In a stinging rebuke of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, Keating said she had allowed the military to overtake foreign policy in determining the China relationship. “Running around the Pacific islands with a lei around your neck handing out money, which is what Penny does, is not foreign policy. It’s a consular task,” he said. “The Albanese government does not employ foreign policy.” He added that China posed no threat to Australia and that aligning with the British, after the UK had abandoned Australia’s defence in the 20th century, was “deeply pathetic”.

Top news Malaysia warning on Aukus | Malaysia has urged Australia, the UK and the US to refrain “from any provocation that could trigger an arms race or affect peace and security in the region”, in a statement issued in response to the Aukus deal. Meanwhile, South Australia, where the nuclear-powered submarines will be built, has pushed back on nuclear waste being left in the state. As part of the Aukus deal, Australia is responsible for any nuclear waste generated by the submarines. Power bills to surge | Electricity bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The Coalition jumped on the news, accusing the Albanese government of breaking its election promise to lower power bills. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, was quick to point out that the rises would be higher were it not for the government’s price caps introduced at the end of last year, and that direct relief would come in the May budget. Queensland is already a step ahead, announcing today a rebate to come in the next financial year. ‘Violet’ Coco’s sentence quashed | The NSW district court has overturned a 15-month jail sentence imposed on the climate protester who blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a truck in April 2022. The original sentencing last December drew attention to the state’s harsh anti-protest laws, including condemnation from the UN. Catholic church abuse | The church is hoping to use the deaths of paedophile clergy to stymy more than a dozen cases brought by historical abuse survivors, an analysis of court records suggests. The strategy, largely adopted in New South Wales, relies on a key decision last year in the state’s highest court, which found the death of Father Clarence Anderson, an abuser long known to the Lismore diocese, rendered the church unable to fairly defend itself against allegations of abuse. NSW police officer stalked woman | Joshua Alan James Wootton, 32, has pleaded guilty to stalking a woman over a period of 11 days in February 2022 and searching for details about her partner using the restricted Cops database. Wootton will face a sentence hearing on 9 June. Tasmanian devils overwhelming possums | The introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island has halved the population of brushtail possums. Don’t be alarmed – researchers say the possums had expanded beyond their usual habitat and restoring a top predator like the Tasmanian devil has helped keep them in check. Massive EV parking fines | If you happen to park your car in an EV charging space, you could be in for a hefty fine. States and territories have been introducing fines, starting with $3,200 in the Australian Capital Territory, $2,875 in Queensland, $2,200 in New South Wales and $369 in Victoria.

What they said … *** “We’ve heard so much about how tight the budget is, and it is … And we’ve heard that we can’t spend money on things that are really important to our communities and to our country. And this [Aukus] is a massive spending commitment for decades to come.” – David Pocock The independent senator questioned how the government intends to finance the massive defence spend, calling on Labor to axe the $243bn stage-three tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, repeated his refusal to scrap the tax cuts. In numbers And about 42% of men reported experiencing physical violence since the age of 15, according to the latest ABS data.

But what if they were scrapped? What if there was an extra $243bn in the budget over the next 10 years? What could be done? And similarly, what if we didn’t spend up to $58bn on a nuclear submarine program over the next ten years, what else could we spend it on?

                "DB-DC Power bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination, announced on Wednesday, is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The AER chair, Clare Savage, said the increases were “significant” but they could have been as much as 40% to 50% without the federal government’s intervention in December to cap domestic gas and black coal prices. The electricity price safety net, also known as the default market offer, is intended to set maximum increases for households and small business customers on standard retail plans in South Australia, New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Victoria releases its own default offer. In NSW, residential customers face price increases of as much as 23.7%, or 16.9 percentage points higher than the inflation rate. Those in south-east Queensland face increases of as much as 19.8% and residents in South Australia as much as 21.8%, the AER said. For small business customers, prices will increase between 14.7% and 25.4% depending on their region, the regulator said. Victoria also released its own draft decision for consultation, proposing the average annual bill for domestic customers on the Victorian Default Offer will rise 31.1%, with small business customers facing increases of 33.2%. “The draft decision proposes an increase of around $426 for residential customers, with typical bills increasing from $1,403 to around $1,829 per year,” the state’s Essential Services Commission said. “For small business customers, typical bills would increase by around $1,738, from $5,620 to around $7,358 per year.” The AER said customers should shop around to minimise the increases. “Based on offers available in February 2023, residential customers switching from a standing offer to the lowest market offer could save 7% to 17% and small business customers could save 9% to 26%, depending on their region,” the regulator said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Savage told ABC’s Radio National: “It’s not as bad as it could have been.” The federal government legislated to cap wholesale gas prices temporarily at $12 a gigajoule and cap coal prices at $125 a tonne, a move Treasury estimated would save the average households $230 on their electricity bills in the next financial year. The AER said forward contract prices for the 2023-24 financial year had begun to fall in south-east Queensland and NSW “as soon as the intervention was publicly mooted”. “Contract prices have now fallen by approximately 50% since the end of October,” it said. “However, despite this significant decline, the trade-weighted average prices for 2023-24 contracts are around $40 per megawatt-hour higher than they were at the start of 2022 in all regions.” On Monday the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said he expected the default offer to be “significantly lower than the AER’s predictions” before the government’s intervention in December. In November the AER advised that, without action, the residential default offer would increase by between 35% and 44% in NSW, 51% in South Australia, and 41% in south-east Queensland. Bowen revealed that the government estimated small business customers were on track to pay 37% more in NSW, 53% more in South Australia and 50% more in south-east Queensland. “We simply had to act,” he told the Sydney Institute. “But I know that will be cold comfort for people who will still have to deal with the resulting energy bill increases.” On Wednesday, Bowen said households would avoid increases of $268 – $530 because of the intervention. The savings for small businesses would reach as much as $1,243. Bowen noted that the government would deliver $1.5bn of energy price relief rebates, expected after the May budget. The Coalition’s energy spokesman, Ted O’Brien, said the higher prices were evidence of a “broken promise reconfirmed”, with more than 82,000 households now on hardship programs. “Energy bills have skyrocketed despite Labor’s promise of a $275 reduction and now they are set to soar even higher,” O’Brien said. “It’s further proof that Labor’s energy plan is failing.” Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, called on Victoria’s Essential Services Commission to “think again” about its “problematic” recommended price increase. “They average contract prices over a 12-month period and so their calculation reflects the surge in contract prices from around June to October last year,” Mountain says. “But there is little evidence to suggest that these contract prices represent the costs that retailers will incur over the coming 12 month period,” he says. The result is that the increases - if maintained in the final decision - would “needlessly deliver large windfall profits particularly for Victoria’s large retailers, at customers’ expense”. “This is contrary to the government’s stated objective in introducing the VDO.” Data from Energy Action shows Victoria’s wholesale power prices jumped from the middle of last year but not as much as states to the north. The commission said wholesale power costs were up 95% from the 2022-23 year, and made up about 36% of the annual domestic bills. The Victorian government said households would still continue to pay less on average for their electricity than residents in south-east Queensland, NSW and South Australia. “We know that Victorian households are facing real pressures because of the increasing cost of energy globally,” said a spokesperson for the energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. “That’s why we’ve fast-tracked a new round of the $250 power saving bonus and encourage Victorians to access our rebates for solar PV and hot water systems. “We’re also reducing our reliance on costly fossil fuels – that’s why we’re bringing back the State Electricity Commission and replacing unreliable, privatised coal with clean, government-owned, renewable energy.” The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the government should explain why the proposed increase was larger for Victorians than elsewhere. “Four years ago, [premier] Daniel Andrews promised Victorians that he would reduce power prices through a default market offer,” Pesutto said. “Well today, he’s broken his promise and he owes Victorians an explanation for why they are paying more for energy prices than people living in other states around our country. People are doing it hard. They need relief, not energy price increases when they can least afford it.” Cassandra Goldie, chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the latest increase would land as a blow for consumers after increases of 20% last year. “People on the lowest incomes do not have anything left in their budgets to cut back on and are at breaking point,” Goldie said. ACOSS wants the federal government to adjust the AER’s guidelines for the default offer to lower retail margins as has been done in Victoria. The chief executive of Energy Consumers Australia, Lynne Gallagher, said as many as half of households could be missing out on assistance that they are eligible for, often because of red tape. “Retailers know when customers are not on the best deal and we’d like them to be more proactive in reaching out to offer them the best possible option,” she said. After consultation, the AER will issue its final default offer for the year in May.",
                "DB-DC The introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island halved the population of brushtail possums, according to new research that suggests restoring top predators to ecosystems could help limit the number of overabundant prey. In 2012, the carnivorous marsupials were introduced to the island off the east coast of Tasmania to create a geographically isolated insurance population free from devil facial tumour disease. Australian researchers have tracked the impact of the introduction on brushtail possums, finding that “possum abundance fell by more than 50% across Maria Island as a whole”. Prior to the devils’ introduction, brushtail possums – which had been introduced to the island in the 1950s – had expanded beyond their usual habitat and had become “a pretty significant predator”, according to study co-author Prof Christopher Johnson of the University of Tasmania. “The place was sort of overwhelmed with possums. They were living in open grasslands a long way from trees,” Johnson said. “They were preying on seabirds – in fact, there were possums living in seabird burrows and coming out at night … and pulling [short-tailed shearwater] chicks out and killing them.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Brushtail possums are considered omnivores, but in most parts of their geographic range they primarily eat foliage, Johnson said. “They den in tree hollows and they feed in the tree canopy … They will come to the ground to feed but typically they don’t go very far from a tree.” A founding population of 28 Tasmanian devils was released on Maria Island in 2012 and 2013, growing to an estimated 100 animals by 2016 – the island’s predicted maximum capacity. Combining data from population surveys and GPS tracking of individual possums, the researchers found that the devils brought about the almost complete disappearance of possums from open grasslands and population decline in dry forest areas. Possum populations “remained stable in wet forests”. Within five years of the devils being introduced, surviving possums were restricted to forest habitats and using tree hollows as den sites, the team found. “In one sense, this is a story of what devils do to possums,” Johnson said. “But it’s also an instance of a bigger story about how predators can control the niche that is occupied by other species. “Predator introductions are pretty rare things still and because the ecological effects of predators in most cases unfold over long periods of time, there really aren’t very many examples like this one.” Johnson described Maria Island as a test case for other devil introductions. “If someone got serious about introducing devils on to the mainland of Australia, where they used to exist, you would need pretty good data on the impacts of devils on the ecosystem,” he said. “We’ve really proved in this case … that if management of possums was the goal, we could say that it worked and we could do it again.” In 2021, a BirdLife Tasmania survey found introduced devils had wiped out little penguins from Maria Island, which had been home to 3,000 breeding pairs of the flightless bird a decade earlier. Previous research conducted by the University of Tasmania scientists also found the devils decimated colonies of the island’s short-tailed shearwaters. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
                "DB-DC Later this week, another late-season heatwave will sear New South Wales, potentially setting record electricity demand in March for the second time in less than a fortnight. For many people, the warmth will be welcome after years of relatively wet seasons and Sydney’s coolest summer for maximum temperatures in 11 years. However, a few within Dominic Perrottet’s government and the electricity sector may find it less relaxing. With the state election just over a week away, the incumbent Coalition can ill afford any hint of electricity disruptions to remind voters – much like the rolling risks for Sydney trains – that key infrastructure remains fragile. Energy issues haven’t been prominent in the election so far, with announcements focused primarily on how to get more renewable energy and storage on to the grid. It’s also a reflection of the tripartisan approach to decarbonisation efforts, with Labor and the Greens signing up to energy minister Matt Kean’s 20-year electricity roadmap launched in late 2020. It’s very unlikely that lights are about to go on the blink or air-conditioners fail. Still, unlike the early March heatwave, western Sydney is forecast to bake with four days from Thursday forecast to reach the mid to high-30s. Brisbane, too, is predicted to warm to 35C on Friday, adding load to the national grid that wasn’t there last week. The issue is the state has a finer margin for error than most voters realise, and that margin is about to narrow further. Just weeks after the election, the remaining three units of AGL Energy’s Liddell power station start to close. By 28 April, the 52-year-old clunker in the Hunter will shut, taking its remaining 1,260 megawatts – or about 10% of NSW’s capacity – offline. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Many of the problems NSW faces are not the government’s fault. Snowy Hydro’s $600m Kurri Kurri gas plant in the Hunter was supposed to be online before next summer to cover Liddell’s exit. That’s been delayed at least a year. Snowy’s gargantuan 2.0 pumped hydro project has its main borer stuck and few people expect the delayed 2027 deadline will be met. And Origin Energy’s decision to accelerate by seven years to 2025 the closure date of Eraring, Australia’s biggest power station with 2,880MW capacity, was also not envisaged by the roadmap. And those are the known issues. Will Centennial Coal keep supplying coal to EnergyAustralia’s Mt Piper power plant near Lithgow as speculation swirls over the future of both? (A spokesperson for Centennial said the firm “continues to work proactively with the NSW government and our customers to underpin the domestic energy market”, adding “there are no current issues impacting Centennial’s ability to supply Mt Piper”.) Whether key transmission lines linking the renewable zones and Snowy 2.0 will be delivered in a timely and economic manner, is another issue. Jihad Dib, Labor’s energy spokesman and the person set to be NSW’s next energy minister should his party form government, is not alone in being wary about what’s ahead. “It’s the most exhilarating, the most challenging job,” Dib tells Guardian Australia. “If you stuff up, you have a massive impact on people’s lives.” Dib supports Kean’s plan to replace coal plants with renewables and storage but says too little has been achieved in the two years since its launch. “It’s not about a glossy brochure or a press release,” Dib says. “I want to see not just a commitment [for investment], I want to see a connection.” A spokesman for Kean says the roadmap and its five designated renewable energy zones have attracted registrations of interest for 152 gigawatts of new projects. Those offerings amount to $283bn in private investments. “The first tender under the roadmap has received overwhelming interest with 16 projects with a combined capacity of 4.3GW, capable of powering the equivalent of almost 1.6m homes,” he said. “Results of these tenders are expected in the coming weeks.” Proponents of the plan say it has built-in flexibility reflected in the accelerated 850MW Waratah Super Battery – the largest committed battery in the southern hemisphere. It could be online by 2025, ahead of Eraring’s closure. The government also issued tenders at the end of last year for a 380MW so-called firming battery that would run for two hours to fill gaps. While adequate generation can be supplied, lowering costs for households and businesses will be a more difficult task, insiders say. NSW’s wholesale power prices are higher than Victoria’s and Queensland’s and the gap has lately been growing. One executive at a large renewable energy developer, though, reckons Dib is right to be concerned about the pace of execution. “The [roadmap] was great, and it remains very good,” the executive says. “It just isn’t being implemented ... It takes too long for projects to be approved. “If Eraring closes on time, they are definitely stuffed.” The executive predicts Origin Energy will demand a lot to keep running a plant the company claims to be spending $240m a year to maintain. Dylan McConnell, a University of NSW energy expert, says it’s surprising the grid remains so strained even after AGL flagged Liddell’s closure at least seven years ago. “How are we still in this position … given we’ve had such a long time?” he says. With the Bureau of Meteorology declaring on Tuesday the chance of an El Niño for later in the year is now 50/50, operators will likely have to prepare for much larger and intense heatwaves than this week’s. “It’s not hard to imagine that it will be very challenging next summer,” McConnell said.",
                "DB-DC On any given day around Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Russian and Nato aircraft and naval vessels, manned and unmanned, buzz around in close proximity, a constant recipe for a superpower crisis along the edges of a war. The stakes are raised by the fact that both sides have thousands of nuclear warheads as a weapon of last resort, and the risks are raised considerably by reckless behaviour. The Russian defence ministry denied any contact between one of their Su-27 fighters and a US MQ-9 Reaper drone which crashed into the Black Sea on Tuesday, insisting the drone went down of its own accord. But the US allegations of dangerous flying and even dumping fuel on the Reaper to disrupt it are detailed – and the Russians have a long record of aggressive behaviour. A 2021 Rand Corporation study analysing dozens of close-shave incidents concluded it was a matter of policy, which Rand dubbed “coercive signalling”. “Moscow appears to be using coercive signals to send targeted messages regarding activities that it finds problematic,” the report said. “Sometimes the coercive signal is something like this: the plane will come up to interrogate the target, shadow at a distance, with wings clean (no missiles) but increasingly with wings dirty (with missiles) as our bilateral relations have deteriorated, and it will leave,” Dara Massicot, one of the report’s authors, said on Twitter in the wake of the drone incident. “Sometimes, usually after other methods were used, Russian signalling would shift to something unsafe and unprofessional to compel a change.” The change they are trying to compel in this case is to keep US aircraft and boats away from the fringes of the Ukraine war, where Russia’s invasion remains stalled and hugely costly, and Ukrainian forces are benefiting from US intelligence support. There have been a string of instances of close encounters since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. In 2017, a Su-27 flew dangerously close to a RC-135 Rivet Joint surveillance plane. The next year, a Russian warplane flew across the nose of a US EP-3 spy plane, and in 2020, a Su-27 flew directly in front of a US B-52 bomber. Tuesday’s incident is more serious because it led to a collision and a crash landing in the sea. It was quite possibly an error. The US European Command pointed to incompetence on the part of the Russian pilot. But Massicot said that in this case “a deliberate bump cannot be ruled out yet”. The collision cost the US a machine that cost up to $32m and triggered a race to get to the wreckage in the Black Sea. If the Russians get there first, it will be an intelligence boon, allowing their experts to pore over its innards at leisure. As the commandant of the US Marine Corps, Gen David Berger, said such scenarios such as the downing of this drone are some of the US military’s greatest worries because of the unpredictability of the chain of events they could trigger in their wake. Berger said it was also a concern in the Pacific. In fact, the last time a US warplane was involved in such a collision, it was off the Chinese coast in April 2001, when a US EP-3 plane was struck by a Chinese interceptor jet on its third close pass. The Chinese plane crashed into the sea and the US spy plane had to make a forced landing on China’s Hainan Island, triggering a diplomatic crisis. Downing an expensive drone over the Black Sea is one thing, but destroying a crewed aircraft and killing pilots or forcing a landing on hostile territory in the middle of the war would lead to a far more volatile situation, with pressure on other sides to act tough. There are open military lines of communication and longstanding conflict-deescalation mechanisms in place to stop scenarios getting out of hand, but every time something like this happens, the world uses up a little bit more of its luck.",
                "DB-DC Nike is the latest global brand to stop using kangaroo leather in shoe production. The sports apparel company said in a statement it “will stop making any product with kangaroo leather in 2023”. It will debut a new version of its popular football boot, the Tiempo Legend Elite, with a new synthetic material “that is a better performance solution and replaces the use of kangaroo leather”. A bill that would ban the sale of kangaroo parts was introduced in January in the US state of Oregon, where Nike has its headquarters, aimed at sportswear manufacturers. The bill would make buying, receiving, selling or commercially exchanging any product containing a part of a dead kangaroo a crime. A similar bill has been introduced in Connecticut, and California enacted a ban on kangaroo-based products in the 1970s. The German sportswear brand Puma also stopped production of football boots made from kangaroo leather this year. The companies have joined a lineup of luxury brands such as Versace and Prada who have banned using kangaroo skin. Animal rights activists have long campaigned against commercial killing of kangaroos. “Nike’s announcement that it will end use of kangaroo skins for its athletic shoes is a seismic event in wildlife protection, and tremors will be felt all over the world, especially in Australia where the mass commercial slaughter of kangaroos occurs,” the president of the Centre for a Humane Economy, Wayne Pacelle, said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The co-founder and director of Kangaroos Alive, Mick McIntyre, said Nike and Puma were doing the right thing. “They are saying, we don’t want to be part of this inhumane slaughter of this international icon.” He said Australia’s commercial kangaroo industry was “cruel and barbaric”. “Kangaroos aren’t farmed. Commercial killing is done in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. The regulation of the industry is almost impossible.” But the commercial harvest of kangaroos is legal in Australia. Conservation culling of the animal still occurs, and conservation experts have previously warned that bans could result in worse outcomes for kangaroos due to overpopulation. The president of the Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, Ray Borda, said Nike’s ban was a move towards synthetic alternatives, rather than a move away from kangaroo. “It is a cyclical trend,” he said. “We have other shoe manufacturers that have increasing demand due to the environmental benefits of kangaroo leather.” The commercial industry sourced responsibly from the wild, Borda said. With one-third the carbon footprint of cattle and sheep, kangaroo products are considered by some as a sustainable option. “They emit less methane, require less water, place less pressure on grazing lands, and don’t require energy to capture and contain,” he said, also pointing to the longevity and biodegradability of kangaroo products. Borda said the commercial industry was needed to sustainably and humanely manage kangaroo numbers to ensure the species’ survival. “As kangaroo populations fluctuate in different conditions, they compete with each other and other animals for food, and put stress on agricultural land,” he said. “Without a commercial harvest, kangaroos would still need to be kept at sustainable levels through government and non-commercial culling, resulting in poorer animal welfare outcomes.”",
                "DB-DC The Catholic church and other institutions are attempting to use the death or incapacitation of paedophile clergy to stymy more than a dozen cases brought by historical abuse survivors, an analysis of court records suggests. The church has drawn widespread criticism since the Guardian revealed its recent, aggressive strategy to use the deaths of paedophile clergy to claim it can no longer receive a fair trial and block survivors’ civil claims permanently. The strategy, largely adopted in New South Wales, relies on a key decision last year in the state’s highest court, which found the death of Father Clarence Anderson, an abuser long known to the Lismore diocese, rendered the church unable to fairly defend itself against a woman known only as GLJ. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That’s despite clear evidence that high-ranking church officials knew Anderson was abusing boys at least four years before GLJ’s alleged assault, but did not remove him from the clergy, instead shuffling him through parishes where he continued to abuse children. An analysis of court records suggests permanent stays are being sought or threatened in at least 13 historical abuse cases, the vast majority in NSW. Eight of the 13 cases where stays are being pursued or threatened involve two Catholic orders, the Marist and Christian Brothers, which run schools across the country. They argue the death or incapacitation of alleged perpetrators leave them unable to receive a fair trial against survivors who are now looking to the civil courts for justice. Those arguments are being mounted even where the perpetrators had a history of abusing children and where the institution held prior knowledge of other alleged offending. Ellis Legal solicitor John Ellis – a survivor whose treatment in the courts forced a belated apology from the late cardinal George Pell – said there were likely many more matters where stays have been threatened in order to discourage survivors from pursuing their rights through the courts. “It has been raised by the Marist Brothers without exception whenever a perpetrator has died and regardless of the complaints history of the perpetrator,” Ellis told the Guardian. “It has even been raised in a matter where the Marist Brothers have given evidence that before the death of the perpetrator, the perpetrator had refused to respond regarding any allegations put to him.” On Friday, the NSW supreme court heard allegations that Marist had sat on its hands for almost two years waiting for Brother Francis “Romuald” Cable, a notorious paedophile clergy member, to die before using his death to claim it could no longer receive a fair trial. It was put on notice of a survivor’s claim involving Cable in 2020, but did nothing to attempt to put the allegations to Cable in the 22 months prior to his death. Marist’s lawyer told the court that Cable refused to talk to them when it approached him in 2015, the year he was sentenced to prison. Marist is now claiming it can’t receive a fair trial because Cable is unable to give any evidence about the alleged abuse. The Christian Brothers is taking a similar approach in at least two cases, using the death or incapacitation of alleged perpetrators to argue it cannot receive a fair trial. The child abuse royal commission found on average that survivors take 22 years to come forward due to a complex set of reasons. It made findings that sought to remove barriers to justice, which prompted states and territories across the country to remove the statute of limitation period that applied to such cases. Maurice Blackburn’s NSW abuse law leader, Danielle De Paoli, said the strategy of seeking permanent stays was undoing the royal commission’s important work. “My view is that the position they’ve been taking in relation to stays is really undoing the good work that came out of the royal commission,” she said. “The royal commission gave survivors a platform to speak and a platform for them to be heard, by threatening stays or making applications for stays, they’re actually doing the reverse. They’re making survivors question whether they will be believed.” Porters Lawyers is representing at least two survivors who are facing the threat of a permanent stay due to the alleged perpetrator’s death or incapacitation. The firm’s principal, Jason Parkinson said: “The indecent haste of the Catholic church to file permanent stay applications in matters relating to known, dead or demented paedophiles is, sadly, not unprecedented. When the statute of limitations was available, they threatened to take away the victims’ houses if child-abuse survivors had the temerity to sue the Holy Roman church – the houses of hard-working, Australian taxpayers. “Given an opportunity, the church will attempt to crush the children they abused every time.” The Guardian approached the Marist and Christian Brothers for a response. GLJ is appealing to the high court, represented by Ken Cush and Associates. Her case will be closely watched by firms representing abuse survivors.",

And in breaking news, a Russian fighter jet has collided with a US Reaper surveillance drone over the Black Sea. Australia Exclusive | A 13-year-old First Nations boy was kept in total solitary confinement in a Queensland youth detention centre for at least 45 days, Guardian Australia has learned. And a whistleblower at the Brisbane watch house has alleged staff conducted “illegal” strip-searches, adults exposed themselves to children and a girl was placed in a cell with adult men. Aukus ruckus | Penny Wong has denied that the potentially game-changing transformation of Australia’s military amounted to fuelling an “arms race” in the region, after China denouncing the Aukus subs deal as a product of a “cold war mentality”. With a pricetag of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, the plan comes with technical risks and political ones too, such as what if an isolationist US president tears up the agreement? At home, Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP who faces the prospect of a nuclear waste dump in his South Australian electorate, has said he is “amazed” the government will begin the search in just 12 months for a facility that won’t be required for decades. Pollution deaths | Air pollution in NSW is estimated to cause 603 premature deaths and increase health costs by $4.8bn each year, according to a government study. And the state is in for some late summer heat this week with temperatures nudging 40C in Sydney. ‘Disregard’ for law | Rape charges against a Melbourne man are set to be dropped after the Victorian court of appeal found police showed an “astonishing disregard” for the law during a search of his home. Shot down | NSW Labor is being criticised for directing preferences to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in a marginal seat despite helping to pass a motion that condemned its leader, Robert Borsak, over an alleged verbal “threat of violence” against a female MP. World ‘Unsafe and unprofessional’ | A Russian fighter has collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea west of Crimea. The military called it an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept and said the Russian pilots had tried to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision. Facebook freeze | Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is laying off a further 10,000 people – less than six months after sacking 11,000 workers – and instituting a further hiring freeze. Bank reckoning | SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders as global stocks continued to suffer yesterday despite assurances from the US president, Joe Biden. In Australia traders are slashing forecasts for another hike in interest rates next month. Asylum appeal | A group of 10 asylum seekers from conflict zones have been granted leave to appeal against the UK government for what they claim has been a failure to consider the dangers and risks of deporting them to Rwanda. Bali ban | The island’s government is going to ban tourists from renting motorbikes after a series of episodes in which foreigners violated traffic rules. Full Story Why is Australia spending up to $368bn on new submarines? Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to our foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, about the risks and rewards of the Aukus agreement. In-depth As the war in Ukraine grinds on, our reporters Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo have joined volunteers from Black Tulip group as they search through the battlefields of northern Donetsk for Russian corpses. The aim is to exchange the bodies for those of fallen Ukrainians but it unearths a grim pattern which shows the invading forces often torch or dump their dead to avoid logging them as casualties. There’s also a powerful set of pictures from Alessio Mamo. Not the news From war to unabashed escapism. Our stream team pick this week is the LA-based reality show Vanderpump Rules. Our critic Katie Cunningham says it was sold to her as “a group of hot people working at a restaurant hook up with each other lot” and it doesn’t disappoint. In fact, she reckons it’s nothing less than the best reality show yet. The world of sport AFL | With the first bounce only a day away, our expert writer reckons Collingwood could go all the way this year but that any one of the top 10 could win the flag. Football | The 2026 World Cup finals in the US, Canada and Mexico will feature 48 teams and 104 games, including a new last-32 stage, with plans for three-team groups abandoned, Fifa has confirmed. Golf | Governing bodies have proposed a new local rule to give tournament organisers the option to use a distance-reducing ball to negate technological advances in player fitness and equipment. Media roundup The papers are mostly positive about the Aukus subs deal, with the Australian praising the prime minister for “reshaping regional power and the Labor party”. The Sydney Morning Herald, however, points to a “mammoth” budget battle to pay for the new boats. In Melbourne protesters have gathered outside Richmond town hall to call for the scrapping of a waste levy, the Age reports.

                " DB-DC “Perhaps the first major diplomatic example of a post-America Middle East,” wrote one analyst. He was describing Iran and Saudi Arabia’s agreement last week to resume diplomatic relations – a surprise to most observers, and something of a coup for China, which brokered it. The volatile rivalry between the two nations has been one of the great geopolitical faultlines since the Iranian revolution of 1979. Security concerns, claims to regional leadership, ethno-sectarian rivalries and other factors have all played their part. The repercussions have been profound. The tensions contributed to Iran’s all-out support for the Syrian regime, fuelled the war in Yemen, where more than 150,000 have died, and accelerated the disintegration of the state in Lebanon. Ties were cut in 2016 when Iranian protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic missions over Riyadh’s execution of a revered Shia cleric. But while last week’s announcement was welcome, it is only a beginning. Assuming the deal goes ahead – there are two months for details to be ironed out – the containment of Saudi-Iranian tensions will not necessarily lead to a deeper rapprochement, let alone end Lebanon’s woes or the complex and multifaceted conflict in Yemen. Talks between Riyadh and Tehran had been taking place since at least 2021. In 2019, an attack on a major oil facility that briefly knocked out half the kingdom’s output intensified security fears. The huge cost and reputational damage of the Saudi intervention in Yemen (in support of the internationally recognised government) gave an initially gung-ho Riyadh pause too. Driving through Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic “Vision 2030” will require vast foreign investment. And amid concern that the kingdom can no longer count on unstinting support from the US, preoccupied with Ukraine and tilting to the Indo-Pacific, this was a reminder to the Biden administration that Riyadh has other friends. For Iran, the benefits are obvious: a first step out of political and economic isolation. It also blames Saudi-funded media for encouraging anti-government protests and wants broadcasts reined in. Meanwhile, China has positioned itself as an alternative to a withering US-led order and as a responsible peacemaker, offering a riposte to criticism for its support for Russia. In truth, Iran and Oman laid the groundwork, and China has brought willing parties together, rather than having to bang heads. Nonetheless, it was Beijing that got the agreement over the line. It enjoys a long partnership with Tehran, but is also Riyadh’s biggest trading partner. In contrast, US dealings with Iran have been worse than ever since the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPoA nuclear deal. Until now, China has focused primarily on trade and economic interests in the Middle East. Now those interests are making it think more broadly about regional stability. It reportedly plans to host a major summit for Iran and Gulf monarchies this year. But as it becomes more enmeshed, it may find it harder to maintain its neutral status. Its involvement could also pave the way for a new era of diplomacy in which democracy and human rights don’t even get lip service. Joe Biden drew flak for fist-bumping the Saudi crown prince, having denounced Jamal Khashoggi’s murder; Beijing insisted that the case should not be “politicised or internationalised” at all. Who really wins from this deal remains to be seen, but authoritarian leaders could benefit more than the ordinary people whose lives have been damaged by the rivalry.",
                "DB-DC It is common for British and American leaders to try to show the “special relationship” between their two countries extends to them personally. When Rishi Sunak landed in San Diego for a flash visit to see Joe Biden, the world’s media were spared any such attempts verging on the grandiose. There was some light banter from Biden about Sunak’s home in California and carefully coordinated invites between the two leaders for future visits. It was a far cry from the scenes of David Cameron playing table tennis with Barack Obama, or Theresa May holding hands with Donald Trump. But when journalists were ushered out of the gym on the naval base in Point Loma, where the leaders of the three Aukus powers had gathered for a summit, the real strength of the relationship between Sunak and Biden became clear. Instead of reams of officials sitting round listening closely, the two leaders spent nearly an hour alone, preferring to have a more personal conversation. There was plenty for them to bond over, before they got into the nitty gritty. Sunak is a big college football fan, from his days as a business student at Stanford. He still has a house in Santa Monica, around three hours’ drive up the west coast. The prime minister also remains so fond of chocolate chip muffins and Mexican cola that he brought a stash of both home. Of course, Sunak is not always keen to talk publicly about his close ties to the US – particularly the green card he held until 2021 and whether he will publish his US taxes. Biden’s angling for an invite to Sunak’s California home may have left the prime minister wanting to wince. But such encounters are highly valuable. Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, has made persistent requests for a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. They appear to have paid off, with the prospect of a visit by Biden to Northern Ireland in April, before Sunak returns for a longer trip to the US in June, this time to Washington DC. In between, they will meet again at the G7 summit in Japan in May. Three such meetings in as many months means hopes are not high Biden will come to the UK for the king’s coronation. There are plenty of issues requiring joint engagement by both leaders that will continue in the background. As well as fulfilling plans to give Australia a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and working through Britain’s concerns about the US Inflation Reduction Act, the question of how to deal with China’s growing “aggression” is a live one. It is likely to have been one of the main topics the two leaders discussed when they held talks away from prying eyes this week. Biden joined the US Senate in 1973, meaning he has been in frontline politics for longer than Sunak, 42, has been alive. There is a wealth of wisdom and experience for the prime minister to admire, especially when it comes to China. During a career keenly focused on foreign affairs, Biden is said to have spent about 100 hours speaking to President Xi Jinping. Much of that was face to face, instead of on long-distance phone calls, making Biden the western world leader with perhaps the greatest personal insight into Xi’s character. At Monday’s summit of the three Aukus powers, they agreed that the “challenge” posed by China stretched decades ahead. So for Sunak to be able to draw on reflections from Biden looking back long term may prove a helpful counterbalance to hot-headed Tory backbenchers.",
                "DB-DC Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the top two Republicans in polling regarding the 2024 presidential nomination, have said defending Ukraine was not a vital US interest, in remarks that will demoralise Kyiv and encourage Vladimir Putin to believe that time is on his side. Trump, a longstanding Putin admirer, has been consistently sceptical about US support for Ukraine, and has suggested he could broker a peace deal, involving Ukraine surrendering territory. DeSantis had previously tried to dodge questions on Ukraine, and his new comments are likely to shift sentiment in the Republican party further from support of Ukraine. Both men answered a questionnaire from Tucker Carlson, the primetime Fox News host, who posted the responses to Twitter. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, said the US should not “become further entangled” in the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump, the former president who dominates polling, said the Ukraine war was not a vital US interest “but it is for Europe … that is why Europe should be paying far more than we are, or equal”. The remarks come at a time of military stalemate, with neither side proving able to make significant breakthroughs on the battlefield. Ukraine is hoping to break the impasse this spring, but it is unclear whether it has enough weapons and experienced soldiers to achieve its aims. Analysts have said that the longer the war continues, the better Putin’s chances, as Kyiv’s western backers get weary of the cost, and Russia’s greater population becomes an increasingly important factor. To Carlson, DeSantis said: “While the US has many vital national interests – securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural and military power of the Chinese communist party – becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.” DeSantis also accused Joe Biden of providing “a virtual blank cheque” to Ukraine and said: “Without question, peace should be the objective. The US should not provide assistance that could require the deployment of American troops or enable Ukraine to engage in offensive operations beyond its borders.” Biden has said US troops will not be deployed and has not encouraged Kyiv to go beyond attempting to expel its invaders. “F-16s and long-range missiles should … be off the table,” DeSantis said. “These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States … closer to a hot war between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. That risk is unacceptable.” The governor also said “a policy of ‘regime change’ in Russia (no doubt popular among the DC foreign policy interventionists) would greatly increase the stakes of the conflict, making the use of nuclear weapons more likely”. Apart from an off-the-cuff Biden remark a year ago, saying that Putin “cannot remain in power”, the administration has been adamant it is not pursuing regime change. In his response to Carlson, Trump claimed: “Russia would definitely not have raided and attacked Ukraine if I was your president.” Characteristically, he couched policy prescriptions in financial terms, claiming the US was being conned by its European allies. In his four years in power, Trump was regularly accused of subservience towards Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. While Senate Republicans are broadly supportive of US military backing for Ukraine, a growing group of hard-right representatives in the House are calling for it to end. With his remarks, DeSantis took sides in a fierce debate within his party. Douglas London, a former senior CIA official, suggested the remarks could be tactical. “DeSantis dismissal of Russia’s war in Ukraine as a vital US interest will invite the Kremlin’s cyber [and] disinformation tools to amplify his message, charge his base and further sow American division,” London said on Twitter. Mark Hertling, a retired general and CNN national security analyst, said: “I was taught and I believe US domestic and international policies are driven foremost by our nation’s values. Independence, sovereignty, respect for individual freedoms and rights, rule of law, dignity of fellow humans … That’s why we help Ukraine.⁩” DeSantis’s characterisation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a “territorial dispute” drew particularly fierce fire. Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic operative and pollster, said Republicans’ “rancid appeasement of Putin has been among the darkest chapters in all of American history. DeSantis parrots Kremlin taking points on Ukraine, again”. Other candidates and prospective candidates also answered Carlson’s questions. The former vice-president Mike Pence cited Ronald Reagan in describing the need to stand up to Russia, thereby aligning himself with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. “I would say anyone that thinks … Putin will stop at Ukraine is wrong,” Pence said. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, issued a statement in favour of continued military support for Ukraine. “Russia’s objective is to take over all of Ukraine by military force. Our objective should be to help the Ukrainians prevent that from happening,” Haley said on Tuesday. Bill Kristol, a conservative Trump critic, asked: “Will ‘Republican internationalists and hawkish elements in the party’s donor class’ rally to candidates like Pence, Haley or Christie now that DeSantis has joined Team Tucker on Ukraine? Or will they once again submit, and embrace dangerous demagoguery?”",
                "DB-DC You’d have thought the Tories would have wanted to give their illegal migration bill – insert your own gags – a good send-off for its second reading. But Rishi Sunak chose to be 8,000 miles away in San Diego. Far away from the scene of the crime. And the government also insisted on two ministerial statements – one of them hardly pressing – to delay the debate until late in the day. Almost as if they wanted it over and done with. As it was the government benches were half empty. Most of the saner Tories had decided to give it a swerve. Not brave enough to speak out in the chamber. The debate started with a point of order from Labour’s Clive Lewis. The bill came with its own health warning that there was a less that 50/50 chance of the government surviving a legal challenge. So why waste parliament’s time? Surely it would be better to let the courts battle this one out first. Suella Braverman disagreed. Labour hadn’t understood. This wasn’t how it worked. What was going to happen was that the UK was going to kick asylum seekers out regardless of international law. A cunning plan to turn us into a rogue state. “The British people aren’t xenophobic,” the home secretary said. Though she was very much hoping she could persuade them to be. We’ve been accused of inflammatory rhetoric, added Braverman. Er yes … guilty as charged. By now the home secretary was looking surprised. Bewildered, even. Now Suella became lachrymose. Some people had made outrageous slurs about her. Indeed they had. Some of her own MPs had said she was a competent, humane home secretary. Tory Richard Graham tried to defend her only to precipitate a pile on from the SNP. Theresa May was the only quizzical voice on the Conservative benches. How did Suella square deporting everyone regardless with our duty to screen refugees properly before sending them to Rwanda? Suella merely shrugged. It was full-on delusional. And the people aren’t as nasty as her. The Tories are still 20 points behind in the polls. Earlier on, the foreign secretary made a statement on the integrated review refresh. Or rather, he merely repeated everything that had been briefed earlier. Only at much greater length. James Cleverly is not a man to use one word where several will do. His real tragedy is that he has no sense of his limitations. He thinks he is a player. A mover and a shaker. Tory MPs merely look on in embarrassment. Cleverly began as he finished. With waffle. Two years on from the last integrated review, he just wanted to clarify a few things. No one could have predicted that Russia would invade Ukraine. Er … It had literally done just that in 2014 and no one had really batted an eyelid. But no matter. Then Cleverly moved on to the details. Such as they were. We would be increasing the defence budget by £5bn. Though as £3bn was already promised to the nuclear programme and £1.9bn to replacing our diminishing weapons stockpile, that would leave the armed forces fighting over the remaining £100m. Labour had no real issues with any of this – David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, may not be so incoherent as Cleverly but he also loves the sound of his own voice and so he took an age to say next to nothing. The deputy speaker was even desperately trying to get him to shut up. Most of the criticism came from the Tory ranks. Some were upset China had not been named as more of a military threat to the UK. The language had been beefed up a little, they argued, but not enough. We were just asking for trouble by not taking China seriously. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the select defence committee, won’t be happy until the UK spends every penny it has on defence. Cleverly merely observed that Ben Wallace had had plenty of time to moan about his budget during the defence questions that had taken place earlier. And because he’d said nothing then he must be happy. Besides which, the government was definitely going to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. There again, he was also under the impression that the Tories would still be in power then. Maybe he knows something we don’t. Actually, scrub that ...",
                //"The time in Westminster is 10.35pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news: Labour’s amendment seeking to block the Illegal Migration Bill was defeated by 249 votes to 312, a majority of 63. It will now pass to its second reading. The vote followed a debate in the House of Commons which lasted just over four hours. Earlier in the debate, home secretary Suella Braverman said: “Despite our reasonable concerns that we have raised on several occasions, like [Tory former home secretary Priti Patel] before me, I am subject to the most grotesque slurs for saying such simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration.” The home secretary also said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She told MPs: “Given the mischaracterisation of the bill from members opposite, I would like to make a few things clear. The home secretary’s duty to remove will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons there needs to be urgent action to “stop the dangerous boat crossings that are putting lives at risk” and undermining border security. But she said: “This bill is a con that makes the chaos worse. It won’t do the things the prime minister and the home secretary have promised, it won’t stop the criminal gangs or dangerous crossings and, in fact, it makes it easier for those gangs as well.” Suella Braverman should consider her position for putting forward “cruel and heartless” immigration policies that discriminate against war refugees of colour, a former Home Office adviser has said. Nimco Ali, a one-time Conservative campaigner who in December left her job as an adviser on violence against women, said the home secretary was “the wrong person not just for the Conservative party but for the country”. A child refugee from Somaliland, Ali said the government’s failure to widen routes open to Ukrainians to other refugees appeared to be “racist” and “painful”. Hundreds of people have gathered in Parliament Square to protest against the government’s controversial new asylum and migration law as MPs debated the measures in the Commons. The crowd, which first congregated around the Winston Churchill statue, chanted “What do we want? Safe passage. When do we want it? Now”, and “Who built the NHS? Migrants built the NHS.” Many held placards, which read “migrants and refugees welcome here: blame austerity, not migrants”. US president Joe Biden said it’s “my intention to go to Northern Ireland and the Republic”, after an invitation from Rishi Sunak to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month. The move was widely expected following the deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. The issue had been seen as a stumbling block to the president’s visit as the White House urged the row to be settled. The UK’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet could double in size as plans were revealed for the new “Aukus” vessels to be based on a British design. In a bid to counter the growing threat from China, the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowed alongside his US and Australian counterparts to stand “shoulder to shoulder” to protect peace in the Indo-Pacific given its implications for security across the world. Sunak quoted former US president John F Kennedy, saying the leaders gathered in San Diego were “United by that same purpose” of freedom, peace and security. He warned China, Russia, Iran and North Korea threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Praising Biden’s leadership and Albanese’s vision, Sunak said the UK would offer “over sixty years’ experience of running our own fleet” and the “world-leading design” for the Aukus class of submarines. Sunak also said the government will not try to influence the outcome of the privileges committee inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. Asked if he would try to persuade Tory members of the committee not to impose too tough a punishment on Johnson if they found him in the wrong, Sunak replied: “That wouldn’t be right. This is a matter for parliament and the house. It’s not a matter for the government.” Sunak rejected suggestions he is detached from the everyday concerns of the public after it emerged his new heated swimming pool uses so much energy that the local electricity network had to be upgraded to meet its power demands. The Guardian revealed that, while many Britons are trying to limit their energy use in the face of increased electricity bills, extra equipment had been installed in North Yorkshire to provide more capacity from the National Grid to Sunak’s constituency home. The BBC’s leadership was facing renewed pressure on Monday after the corporation U-turned to bring Gary Lineker back to Match of the Day, cancelling the presenter’s suspension without requiring him to make any significant concessions. Three days after Lineker was taken off air for criticising the language used by ministers when discussing the government’s asylum policy, Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, announced an independent review of the corporation’s social media guidelines. Humza Yousaf said he would shift the campaign for independence into “fifth gear” if he wins the SNP leadership, following a suggestion from a colleague that it should “go down a gear”, PA Media reports. Ben Macpherson, the minister for social security in the Scottish government, said it would take longer than the short or medium term for Scotland to become a successful independent country. Hospitals have cancelled tens of thousands of outpatient appointments and operations this week as they prepare for a junior doctors’ strike that will severely disrupt NHS care. NHS trusts in England have postponed many more procedures than for any of the recent walkouts by nurses and ambulance staff. Theresa May is to release a book about a series of political scandals, titled The Abuse of Power, which promises to reveal the way institutions close ranks in order to avoid dishonour. The former prime minister has never released a memoir but the book – due to be published in autumn 2023 – promises to reveal the story behind famous scandals including the Hillsborough and Grenfell tragedies, the Daniel Morgan police corruption case and parliamentary dramas. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog this evening. Thanks for following along. Goodbye for now. Labour’s amendment seeking to block the Illegal Migration Bill was defeated by 249 votes to 312, a majority of 63. The vote followed a debate in the House of Commons which lasted just over four hours. Earlier in the debate, home secretary Suella Braverman said: Despite our reasonable concerns that we have raised on several occasions, like [Tory former home secretary Priti Patel] before me, I am subject to the most grotesque slurs for saying such simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration. The worst among them, poisoned by the extreme ideology of identity politics, suggest that a person’s skin colour should dictate their political views. I will not be hectored by out-of-touch lefties, or anyone for that matter. I won’t be patronised on what appropriate views for someone of my background can hold. I will not back down when faced with spurious accusations of bigotry. In contrast, Labour said the Illegal Migration Bill is a “con that makes the chaos worse” and “will lock up children”. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons: We need urgent action to stop the dangerous boat crossings that are putting lives at risk and undermining our border security. But this Bill is a con that makes the chaos worse. It won’t do the things the prime minister and the home secretary have promised, it won’t stop the criminal gangs or dangerous crossings and, in fact, it makes it easier for those gangs as well. It won’t return everyone, in fact it makes it harder to get return agreements. It won’t clear the asylum backlog, in fact it will mean tens of 1000s more people in asylum accommodation and hotels. MPs have divided to vote on the Labour amendment to the second reading of the government’s illegal migration bill. It seeks to decline to approve the bill at its second reading. The result is due at 10.15pm. US president Joe Biden said it’s “my intention to go to Northern Ireland and the Republic”, following an invitation from Rishi Sunak to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month. The move was widely expected following the deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. The issue had been seen as a stumbling block to the president’s visit as the White House urged the row to be settled. Suella Braverman should step down for putting forward “cruel and heartless” immigration policies that discriminate against war refugees of colour, a former Home Office adviser has said. Nimco Ali, a one-time Conservative campaigner who in December left her job as an adviser on violence against women, said the home secretary was “the wrong person not just for the Conservative party but for the country”. A child refugee from Somaliland, Ali said the government’s failure to widen routes open to Ukrainians to other refugees appeared to be “racist” and “painful”. Her words came as the government faced opposition from MPs across the House of Commons as it attempted to push the illegal migration bill through parliament on Monday. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas criticised the “immoral, deeply cruel and divisive” proposed law, and ripped up a copy of the bill at the end of her speech. The MP for Brighton Pavilion said: “The home secretary on the face of this bill invites Parliament to rip up international law. The only act of a Parliament that has some kind of moral integrity is to rip up her illegal and immoral bill, which has no place on our statute book.” Independent MP Claudia Webbe (Leicester East) said “many would argue that this is racist legislation” and criticised the powers to detain people for 28 days, claiming: “This is state-sanctioned fascism.” Meanwhile back in London the debate over the illegal migration bill goes on, with a Tory MP warning that “hundreds of millions” of people want to come to the UK. Scott Benton, MP for Blackpool South, told the Commons: “Our public services are already creaking under enormous pressure and we simply can’t accept hundreds of millions of people who would no doubt look to come here for a better life. I’m afraid this country is nearly full.” He said the Aukus vessel would be “one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known”. He said the plans could “not happen without cutting-edge American technology and expertise” while also heralding the “world-leading” British design. Sunak said the deal would “create thousands of good, well-paid jobs in places like Barrow and Derby”. Sunak quoted former US president John F Kennedy, saying the leaders gathered in San Diego were “United by that same purpose” of freedom, peace and security. He warned China, Russia, Iran and North Korea threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Praising Biden’s leadership and Albanese’s vision, Sunak said the UK would offer “over sixty years’ experience of running our own fleet” and the “world-leading design” for the Aukus class of submarines. “For the first time ever, it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across both the Atlantic and Pacific, keeping our oceans free, open, and prosperous for decades to come,” he said. Meanwhile as MPs in London debate the illegal migration bill Rishi Sunak is 8,000 miles away in San Diego unveiling details of the Aukus nuclear submarine pact. The press conference where Sunak would appear beside the US and Australian leaders, Joe Biden and Anthony Albanese, was supposed to be an hour ago but is just getting started now. You can read my colleague Aubrey Allegretti’s curtain raiser here Some Tory MPs are only able to support the illegal migration bill “because of the safeguards that are written into it”, the Conservative chairman of the justice select committee has said. Sir Bob Neill told the Commons: It is not unlawful or illegitimate, faced with new and novel developments in the means of entry into the United Kingdom unlawfully, to test the legal position. That’s what the bill does no more at this stage. It’s legitimate to do that. He went on: That said, some of us are only able to support this bill tonight because of the safeguards that are in written into it, for example habeas corpus, and others. Sir Bob noted that as the bill makes its way through the Commons and the Lords “some of us will be looking to improve the protections in relation to children, in relation to families, in relation to some of the tests”. He also insisted that “left on its own this bill, or any other bill, will not achieve anything”, adding: The real need is to operationalise the situation and to improve the lamentable performance our asylum system and immigration system has had for a number of years. The situation for asylum seekers in Knowsley has “deteriorated” since a protest outside their hotel – and some have been assaulted, the Labour MP for the area says. A protest last month outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Knowsley, Merseyside, saw a police van vandalised and fireworks thrown. The MP for the area, Labour former minister Sir George Howarth, says “we should all be ashamed” of the situation, while hitting out at the government’s illegal migration bill in the Commons. He says: I want to agree with the home secretary on one thing. And that is when she said we should choose our words carefully. It’s just a pity she didn’t do so herself. He adds: There is a hotel in Knowsley with 180-plus asylum seekers. I won’t talk about that in detail because I had an urgent question on it a few weeks ago. But what I will say is since then the situation has deteriorated to the extent that some of the refugees have been verbally abused in the street, and others have been assaulted. And they have fled because the countries they come from were unsafe, only to find themselves in an unsafe position in this country. And I think we should all be ashamed. It’s not just happening in Knowsley, it’s happening all over the country. The home secretary has said children will be exempt from detention and removal from UK under the illegal migration bill. Suella Braverman said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She said: Consistent with current policy, only in limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion, we will remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from the UK. Otherwise, they will be provided with the necessary support in the UK until they reach 18. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the government’s migration policy “a disgraceful piece of legislation” at a protest in Parliament Square this evening. The former Labour leader, who now sits as an independent MP, spoke at the ‘stop the bill’ protest, saying he believed the Illegal Migration Bill would lead to the UK’s removal from the European convention on human rights (ECHR). He said: I just heard the home secretary say they were going to shut down the people traffickers. The people traffickers exist because this policy creates a market for them and creates an opportunity for them to exploit people. Corbyn added that the bill contained “vile language” used to “dehumanise desperate groups of people”. Claudia Webbe, the independent MP for Leicester East, says it is “frankly frightening” to be at the second stage of a bill that begins with an admission from the home secretary “that the proposed legislation is not compatible with international law and our human rights obligations”. The former Labour MP tells the House of Commons that the European court of human rights was drafted by the UK and protects the rights of “every one of us”, despite “misrepresentation”. She adds: Not even children are safe under this bill. Whilst the bill does not instruct the deportation of unaccompanied children, it does give permission for their deportation if the government or home secretary so wishes. This is monstrous legislation and no assurances from the party opposite can make it less so. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael has said the bill would deprive entitled people to the right of asylum. He says: And what will be the consequence of that? They will be sent away and many of them will die. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, adds that he wants to see the government succeed in stopping the boats due to the “danger that dies for all those that try to make that route”. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood accuses home secretary Suella Braverman’s politics of being “xenophobic” and “racist”. He tells MPs in the Commons: The home secretary, in her opening statement, said that she can’t be xenophobic or racist just because of her colour and her origins. Well, I say to her, of the same colour and same origin, that that is exactly what her politics are about. Her politics are about dividing our society, our community, based on that. That is what she is doing and that is what she continues to do. The people of the United Kingdom are not so naive as to take this huge nonsense of xenophobia and racism from this party to be put forward. Elsewhere in the debate, Conservative former minister Sir John Hayes says: The plain fact is that our kingdom’s borders are being breached day after day with impunity. Of course Britain should provide a safe haven for people in need, in genuine need. But it is a deceit to pretend the asylum system is not being gamed and the British people taken for a ride. He adds that “economic migrants with no legal right to be here” are being “enabled by fat cat law firms, aided and abetted by militant interest groups who are determined to subvert the will of the people, and cheered on by vacuous self-indulgent celebrities leading millionaire lifestyles”. Aspana Begum, the Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, describes the bill as “abhorrent and unlawful”. She continues: Human rights and legal organisations are calling this one of the most damaging bills pushed forward by a British government in living memory. This is because the illegal migration bill amounts to a refugee ban. It breaches fundamental and internationally recognised human rights, it attacks our way of life and it attacks our communities all over the UK. Let us be clear; persecuting refugees and anti-migrant scaremongering does not benefit the majority of people. The cynical and dangerous use of scapegoating to divide people by an unpopular government, which has overseen a horrifying death toll during the pandemic and continues to inflict hardship and suffering across the UK, does damage our communities. Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs committee, has said the illegal migration bill “potentially leaves the Home Office in a legal quagmire”. She repeats the assertions from Labour and the SNP that it will result in a situation whereby tens of thousands of people are detained and “bailed into a permanent state of limbo”. She says: There is nothing specifically in this bill about tackling criminal gangs, people smugglers and traffickers. She concludes: We all want action on small boats. But what we want is effective action that will deal with the problem. The Conservative former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland says suggestions his party “is cruel, callous and that we don’t care about people” is “utterly, utterly wrong”. He highlights that he fought hard for the nationality and borders bill to make its way through the House of Commons, as justice secretary. He tells MPs: What our constituents are fed with is the seeming inability of the system to enforce the laws that we pass in this place, to get on with the jobs of lawful deportation, to make sure that people don’t overstay their visas. He adds that the small boats crisis “is actually the product of a successful approach we took when it came to the control of lorries”. He says: We succeeded in plugging that loophole and I’m pretty sure if we succeeded in plugging this loophole, another one would emerge. From all the evidence I know from asylum seekers I speak to in my constituency, and I do so regularly, this is a price-driven market. It is simply cheaper to come here on small boats than it is by other means at the moment. Buckland says the government is looking to use law, where operations – such as working with France and other countries – would have a better chance of working. He adds that “we have got to do more on safe and legal routes” in tandem with this legislation. Returning to Alison Thewliss’s (SNP) speech, she says there is no deal in existence with the EU and that Brexit has made the issue “much more difficult”. She adds: What this bill does do is create an underclass of people stuck in immigration limbo indefinitely. The bill will detain everybody arriving on a small boat for 28 days. The UK’s current detention capacity is 2,286 beds. The number of people crossing in small boats last year was 45,755 and, for context here, the prison population in England and Wales in 2022 was just over 81,000 people. So, where on earth does the home secretary suggest that the number of people she wishes to detain are kept, as well as those deemed inadmissible but unreturnable? Theresa May tells the shadow home secretary that under the Labour government the backlog of asylum cases rose to between 400,000 and 450,000. Intervening during Yvette Cooper’s speech, the Tory former prime minister says: If she thinks the current figure means the system is in chaos, then what was her description of the system under the Labour government of which she was a member, which had a backlog in asylum cases of between 400 and 450,000? Cooper replies: The former prime minister and former home secretary is experienced enough to know that is not an accurate characterisation. By the time the Labour government left office, the backlog of initial decisions was just a few thousand. Now it is 160,000 and in fact has trebled in the last few years as a result of the complete failure by the Conservative benches. Conservative former prime minister Theresa May has expressed concerns over the government’s immigration reforms. She tells the Commons: Anybody who thinks that this bill will deal with the issue of illegal migration once and for all is wrong. Opening her speech, May says: Having been home secretary for six years, I understand the pressures to deal with illegal migration. In my day, people were getting into backs of lorries and backs of cars of British tourists returning across the border at Calais. I did a deal with the French, the numbers went down. I have to say, I suspect it’s partly because of the success of that policy that we now see people coming in small boats. I welcome the new deal that’s been done with France because it will have an impact. But what should be clear from this is whenever you close a route, the migrants and the people smugglers find another way, and anybody who thinks that this bill will deal with the issue of illegal migration once and for all is wrong. Not least because a significant number, if not the majority, of people who are here illegally don’t come on small boats, they come legally and overstay their visas. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s home office spokesperson, says “this refugee ban bill is nothing but an abhorrent dog whistle”. She says her SNP colleagues do not support it but do support a “functioning and fair immigration system, which is a million miles away from what we have now”. She adds: This bill has been rushed through with no proper impact assessment, on the back of legislation barely even in place. Yvette Cooper goes on to question what has happened to the Conservative party that “once voted to introduce the modern slavery bill”, adding that they were “right to do so”. She says: How low have they fallen and how far down are they trying to drag our proud country? Because that is what this is. It is an attempt to drag our whole country down. They know this bill won’t work to stop boat crossings or to stop the gangs, they know it won’t clear the backlog, they know it will make the chaos worse. She adds that it will “undermine our reputation in the eyes of the world as a country that believes in the rule of law”. She says the Tories don’t care and it is all about political gain. Sunak just wants to pick a fight, Cooper says. “All he wants is someone else to blame,” she says. Suella Braverman says Rwanda “has the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people if necessary”. She tells MPs about detention in the UK: We are expanding detention capacity with two new immigration removal centres, but clearly we are not building capacity to detain 40,000 people, nor do we need to. The aim of this bill is not to detain people, but to swiftly remove them. She adds: Arguments that our approach cannot work because Rwanda lacks capacity are wrong. Let me be clear, our partnership with Rwanda is uncapped. We stand ready to operationalise it at scale as soon as is legally practicable. It is understandable that Rwanda has not procured thousands of beds to accommodate arrivals while legal challenges are ongoing. Intervening, Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says: The home secretary has just admitted that Rwanda doesn’t have thousands of places. She will know that the Rwandan government has talked about taking a few hundred people … where is she expecting to send the tens of thousands of people expected to arrive in the UK this year? Braverman responds: [The agreement with Rwanda] is uncapped and potentially Rwanda could accommodate high numbers of people that we seek to relocate. Rwanda has the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people if necessary. Home secretary Suella Braverman said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She told MPs: Given the mischaracterisation of the bill from members opposite, I would like to make a few things clear. The home secretary’s duty to remove will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Consistent with current policy, only in limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion, we will remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from the UK. Otherwise, they will be provided with the necessary support in the UK until they reach 18. With respect to the removal of families and pregnant women, it bears repeating that the overwhelming majority of illegal arrivals are adult men under the age of 40. Removing them will be our primary focus. But we must not create incentives for the smugglers to focus on people with particular characteristics by signposting exemptions for removal. It is right that we retain powers to adapt our policy so that we can respond to any change in tactics by the smuggling gangs. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative MP, says “everybody knows you are caught on average once by French police on the beaches”. Those hoping to cross the Channel come back the next day, he says. He insists the only way to stop the boats is to support the government’s legislation. Yvette Cooper, however, says he is “kidding himself” if he thinks the bill will change anything. She repeats the claim that tens of thousands of asylum seekers will be added to the backlog, costing “billions”. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, describes the bill as a “con” and says the reality is Braverman is creating misinformation and that her plan will “unravel”. She says the home secretary has already got power to fast-track returns to Albania, with 99% of cases remaining in limbo. She says: The real problem is Conservative Home Office ministers don’t have any grip on the system they are supposed to be in charge of. Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters have gathered in Parliament Square to protest against the government’s Illegal Migration Bill. Zrinka Bralo, CEO of Migrants Organise, said: We are here to stand up for dignity and justice and speak out against this new bill, which is further dehumanising and demonising refugees and is damaging our democracy. Protesters chanted “money for health and education not for war and deportation” as many held placards reading “refugees always welcome”, PA Media reported. Other chants included “say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here”, and “who built the NHS, migrants built the NHS”. Yvette Cooper says Suella Braverman’s plan will mean tens of thousands more people in asylum accommodation and hotels and will not clear the backlog. She says it won’t deliver safe and managed alternatives, resulting in children being locked up. It will deny citizenship for people like Mo Farah, she adds. Theresa May, the former home secretary and former PM, said the government bill will allow people to be removed from the UK quickly. But the memorandum with Rwanda about the Rwanda deal said the UK would screen asylum seekers first, she said. How would that be possible if people were being removed quickly. Braverman claimed the UK screening process was robust. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the last home secretary passed a law to make people crossing the Channel in small boats ineligible for asylum. But just 21 people have been removed as result, she said. This graphic in an IfG report illustrates this. Braverman said those figures did not include other people who had been removed, such as those removed to Albania. Braverman accuses oppositon MPs of not having any proposals to stop small boat crossings. She says that in practice they favour open borders. They are trying to deceive the public, she argues, because they are “dressing what is an extreme political argument in the fake garb of humanitarianism”. She tells MPs: The way to stop these deaths is to stop the boats. Secondly, the critics ignore that our policy does, in fact, guarantee humanitarian protection for those who genuinely need it. Our policy is profoundly and at heart a humane attempt to break the incentive that sustains the business model of the smuggling gangs. She adds: Crucially, if people are truly in need of protection, they will receive protection in Rwanda. Joanna Cherry (SNP) said gay and trans people were not protected by anti-discrimination laws in Rwanda. She asked Braverman if she thought it was a safe country. Braverman said the Rwanda deal had been approved by the courts. John Redwood (Con) asked Braverman if she was concerned that people crossing the Channel on small boats were linked to criminality. Braverman said she had spoken to police chiefs, and they told her that criminality, and the drug trade, were linked to people who had come to the UK on small boats. Braverman says she has been the subject of “grotesque slurs” just for saying “simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration”. She says the same thing happened to Priti Patel when she was home secretary. But she won’t be put off by “out of touch lefties”, she says. Claims that government policies backed by the majority of British people are bigoted are “irresponsible”, she says. Braverman says there is nothing inconsistent in someone like her, the child of immigrants, saying that immigration has been been overwhelmingly good for the country, but that that there has been “too much of it in recent years”. And she says uncontrolled and illegal immigration is “simply bad”. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is speaking now. She says stopping the boats is her top priority. She says polls suggest the public support the bill by a margin of two to one. The debate on the illegal migration bill is about to start. As Nigel Evans, the deputy speaker, was about to call Suella Braverman, the home secretary, the Labour MP Clive Lewis rose to make a point of order, pointing out that the bill includes a statement saying it might not be compatible with the European convention on human rights. He claimed that on that basis the debate should not even go ahead. Rishi Sunak has been giving interviews in California. Speaking to ITV’s Robert Peston, he said the government will not try to influence the outcome of the privileges committee inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. Asked if he would try to persuade Tory members of the committee not to impose too tough a punishment on Johnson if they found him in the wrong, Sunak replied: That wouldn’t be right. This is a matter for parliament and the house. It’s not a matter for the government. And asked if the government might intervene to try to stop Johnson being suspended from the Commons for 10 days or more, a move that could trigger a recall byelection, Sunak replied: No, again, this is a matter for parliament, for the house. It’s not right for the government to get involved. The normal practice with inquiries of this kind is for the privileges committee to make a recommendation at the end of its inquiry and, if that involves an MP facing a sanction, for the Commons to vote to approve it. Normally there is not even a vote, because MPs accept the committee’s recommendations, and if there is a division, it is not normally seen as a party political matter. But when Boris Johnson was PM, he did order Tory MPs to vote down a standards committee recommendation for Owen Paterson to be suspended. That was seen as a massive mistake, and within days the government backed down. If the privileges committee does propose suspending Johnson, some of his most loyal supporters (and pro-Johnson papers like the Daily Mail) might expect Sunak to tell Tory MPs to vote against the punishment. Sunak is making it clear this will not happen. Politicians, in all parties, often start of quite radical but, if they go into government, end up mellowing, tamed by pragmatism and first-hand exposure to the establishment. But not Theresa May. On the basis of the publicity for a book she is publishing later this year, she is going the other way. According to the blurb from Waterstones, the former PM will be “railing against the corruption and self-enrichment she sees as endemic in modern Parliamentary politics”. Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn is going to help her write it. In a quote describing the book published by the Bookseller, May says that what she was in government she saw “public institutions abusing their power” over and over again. She says: When I stood on the steps of No 10 as prime minister for the first time I set out my determination to fight burning injustices and govern not for the powerful but for the people. Time and time again, during my period in government, I saw public institutions abusing their power by seeking to defend themselves in the face of challenge rather than seek the truth. These were the very bodies whose job was to protect the public, but they sought to protect themselves. From Hillsborough to Primodos to child sexual exploitation this increased the suffering of victims and delayed justice. Our democracy depends on people having trust in their public institutions and politicians. I am delighted to be working with Headline as the accounts I give in this book show how that trust has been eroded over time and why we need to act. The synopsis of the book says: As prime minister for three years and home secretary for six years, Theresa May confronted a series of issues in which the abuse of power led to devastating results for individuals and significantly damaged the reputation of, and trust in, public institutions and politicians. From the Hillsborough and Grenfell tragedies, to the Daniel Morgan case and parliamentary scandals, the powerful repeatedly chose to use their power not in the interests of the powerless but to serve themselves or to protect the organisation to which they belonged. The Abuse of Power is a searing exposé of injustice and an impassioned call to exercise power for the greater good. Drawing on examples from domestic and international affairs she was personally involved in at the highest level, including Stop and Search and the Salisbury Poisonings, the former prime minister argues for a radical rethink in how we approach our politics and public life. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and one of the most prominent China hawks in the party, used his question to James Cleverly in the statement on the integrated review to mock the government’s new approach. He said that, when Rishi Sunak was standing for the leadership last summer, he described China as a “systemic threat”. That was later watered down to “systemic challenge”, and treating China with “robust pragmatism”. He went on: That robust pragmatism meant that we have sanctioned nobody in Hong Kong, when America has sanctioned 10; that we have sanctioned three low officials in Xinjiang, when America has sanctioned 11, including Chen Quanguo, the architect of that terrible atrocity; and we did not kick out the Chinese officials who beat people up on the streets of the UK. But now I understand that [China is seen as] an epoch-defining challenge. I just want to ask, in the document that the prime minister has produced today, in the same paragraph he does refer to that epoch-defining challenge. But then he goes on to say that this is in the face of that “threat”. Does this now mean that China is a threat? Or an epoch-defining challenge? Or a challenging government epoch? Or even none of that? In reply, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said he could understand the desire to sum up the policy towards China with a single phrase. But he said with a country as big and as significant as China, it was not possible to make it that simple. Here is a key passage in the integrated review refresh explaining government policy to China. It says: The UK’s China policy is being updated to respond to two overarching factors that have continued to evolve since IR2021: i. First, China’s size and significance on almost every global issue, which will continue to increase in the years ahead in ways that will be felt in the UK and around the world. China is a long-standing permanent member of the UN Security Council. It now accounts for nearly a fifth of the world economy and is a major investor in the developing world. It is highly advanced in several industrial, scientific and technological fields, and plays a vital role in many global supply chains of importance to the UK. As the world’s largest investor in sustainable energy and the largest emitter of carbon, the choices that China makes are critical to our collective ability to tackle climate change. In other areas such as global health and pandemic preparedness, decisions taken by China have the potential to have profound impact on our lives at home. ii. Second, the UK’s growing concerns about the actions and stated intent of the CCP. Since IR2021, it has chosen to strengthen its partnership with Russia just as Russia pursued its invasion of Ukraine, and continued to disregard universal human rights and its international commitments, from Tibet and Xinjiang to Hong Kong. Its ‘new multilateralism’ is challenging the centrality of human rights and freedoms in the UN system. It has pursued rapid and opaque military modernisation with huge new investments, militarised disputed islands in the South China Sea, and refused to renounce the use of force to achieve its objectives with regard to Taiwan. It has used economic power to coerce countries with which it disagrees, such as Lithuania. The CCP has sanctioned British parliamentarians and acted in other ways to undermine free speech. And as the Director General of MI5 identified publicly last year, it has engaged in both espionage and interference in the UK. The UK does not accept that China’s relationship with the UK or its impact on the international system are set on a predetermined course. Our preference is for better cooperation and understanding, and predictability and stability for global public good. But we believe that this will depend on the choices China makes, and will be made harder if trends towards greater authoritarianism and assertiveness overseas continue. The UK’s policy towards China will therefore be anchored in our core national interests and our higher interest in an open and stable international order, based on the UN Charter and international law. Where it is consistent with these interests, we will engage constructively with the Chinese government, business and people and cooperate on shared priorities. But wherever the CCP’s actions and stated intent threaten the UK’s interests, we will take swift and robust action to protect them. This is the template for mature diplomacy between two P5 nations and is aligned with the approaches adopted by our closest allies and partners, including those in Europe, the US, Australia, Canada and Japan. By comparision, this is what the original integrated review, published in March 2021, said about China. Since then, the language has been toughened – although not as much as some Conservatives want. China as a systemic competitor. China’s increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s. The scale and reach of China’s economy, size of its population, technological advancement and increasing ambition to project its influence on the global stage, for example through the Belt and Road Initiative, will have profound implications worldwide. Open, trading economies like the UK will need to engage with China and remain open to Chinese trade and investment, but they must also protect themselves against practices that have an adverse effect on prosperity and security. Cooperation with China will also be vital in tackling transnational challenges, particularly climate change and biodiversity loss … China’s growing international stature is by far the most significant geopolitical factor in the world today, with major implications for British values and interests and for the structure and shape of the international order. The fact that China is an authoritarian state, with different values to ours, presents challenges for the UK and our allies. China will contribute more to global growth than any other country in the next decade with benefits to the global economy. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also presents the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, says many MPs hoped that previous cuts to the defence budget would be cut today. The world is sliding towards a new cold war, but the government is maintaining a peacetime budget. He says the government should move to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence now. Cleverly says the government has committed to 2.5% as a sustainable baseline. He says the government will continue to assess threats, and make sure policy is aligned to deal with them. Alicia Kearns, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, says she welcomes much of what is in the revised integrated review. But she says China should not just be seen as an economic threat. She urges the government to show greater resolve in dealing with Chinese oppression, for example, by shutting down their illegal police stations abroad. Cleverly says the government considers that the threat from China is not just economic. The updated integrated review includes a foreword from Rishi Sunak. This is what he says in it about China. China poses an epoch-defining challenge to the type of international order we want to see, both in terms of security and values – and so our approach must evolve. We will work with our partners to engage with Beijing on issues such as climate change. But where there are attempts by the Chinese Communist party to coerce or create dependencies, we will work closely with others to push back against them. And we are taking new action to protect ourselves, our democracy and our economy at home. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, says the original integrated review had some serious shortcomings. He says it did not see the risk of the Taliban taking over Kabul, and it did not anticipate the invasion of Ukraine. He says it did not even mention Taiwan. He says it said almost nothing about the EU. And he says the rhetoric in the document, on topics such as the fight against kleptocracy and the importance of international law, contrasted poorly with what the government was doing. Cleverly is now setting out highlights from the review that were briefed overnight. Cleverly says the updated review sets out how the government will respond to China. He says the government “cannot be blind to the increasingly aggressive military and economic behaviour of the Chinese Communist party, including stoking tensions across the Taiwan Strait and attempts to strong-arm partners”. Cleverly starts by saying the integrated review published two years ago set out how the UK would thrive in a more complicated age. It showed how the government would use “the combined might of every part of government to ensure that our country remains safe, prosperous and influential into the 2030s”, he says. He says the approach was right. He goes on: On every continent of the world, the United Kingdom walks taller today than it has done for many years. This provokes some laughter. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is now making his statement to MPs about the updated integrated defence and security review. Deltapoll has polling out today giving Labour a 23-point lead over the Conservatives – up seven points on the previous week. James Johnson, a pollster who used to work for Theresa May, has highlighted these figures showing Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings going up in recent weeks, particularly among people who voted Tory in 2019. Humza Yousaf has said he would shift the campaign for independence into “fifth gear” if he wins the SNP leadership, following a suggestion from a colleague that it should “go down a gear”, PA Media reports. Ben Macpherson, the minister for social security in the Scottish government, said it would take longer than the short or medium term for Scotland to become a successful independent country. Writing in Scotland on Sunday yesterday, Macpherson said: Any reckless, overly disruptive path to statehood would quickly make our quality of life in Scotland poorer. Better to go down a gear and take the journey at a reasonably safe speed than crash trying to rush things. Today, on a visit to Stirling, Yousaf, the health secretary in the Scottish government and one of the three SNP leadership candidates, said he disagreed. Asked about Macpherson’s comment, he replied: I have the opposite view, I think we should be ramping up, not ramping down activity. If I was the first minister I’d put us into fifth gear – let alone take it down a gear. There’s a number of prospectus papers I would commit to publishing around the case for independence as soon as I become first minister. But also, on day one, we’ve got to kick start the Yes movement. Kate Forbes, the finance secretary and Yousaf’s main rival, also said she disagreed with Macpherson suggestion that independence should be made less of an immediate goal, and more of a long term one. She said: I would fundamentally disagree [with Macpherson]. I think we have learned lessons of how not to do it from Brexit, but I think you can be far more effective in laying the groundwork from the very beginning. I think the nature of the transition is that it’s gradual, but I would distance myself from the assumption that it would take decades, or indeed many, many years. Yousaf and Forbes, who are the two frontrunners in the contest, have both been accused of favouring a more gradual approach to independence than Nicola Sturgeon. Ash Regan, the former community safety minister who is the third candidate in the contest, appears to prioritise independence more than her rivals. She has said she thinks Scotland could get independence without a referendum if enough voters back pro-independence parties. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, has expressed concern about the illegal migration bill. In an interview with BBC News he said that, if called to speak in the debate this afternoon, he would ask how someone, from Somalia, for example, could legitimately claim asylum in the UK without having to cross the Channel in a small boat. “When we have [the answer to] that, then we do have a solution,” he said, implying that in its current state the bill was flawed. Chris Skidmore, the Conservative former minister who did a net zero review for the government and who is standing down at the next election, has said he will not vote for the illegal migration bill tonight. Caroline Nokes, another former Tory minister, has also said she will not vote for the bill. She said the proposals filled her with “absolute horror”. Two MPs abstaining does not constitute a significant rebellion. But what Nokes and Skidmore have shown is that the bill does not have universal support on the government backbenches. As Michael Savage and Toby Helm reported in the Observer yesterday, “a potential Tory rebellion [is] already brewing over the proposals”. There are even reports that Priti Patel, the former home secretary, may speak out against parts of the bill. These are from Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has posted a thread on Twitter about the significance of Rishi Sunak saying he wants to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”. It starts here. And here are some of the points he is making. And this is from Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS (and Zaranko’s boss). Many Tories were furious with Gary Lineker for comparing the language used by the government to discuss migrants with what was said in Nazi Germany. More than 30 MPs and peers reportedly signed a letter saying Lineker should apologise “at the very least”. It was organised by the Common Sense group, a rightwing Tory caucus particularly hostile to liberalism. But not all rightwingers think the same way. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, is more libertarian than his Common Sense colleagues and he told GB News this morning that he was “not fussed” about Lineker criticising the govenrment. Rees-Mogg, who also presents a show on the station, said: I think those of us broadly on the right have to be very, very careful about attacking people for freedom of speech, so I’m not fussed about what he says. But Rees-Mogg did argue that the row strengthened the case for the abolition of the BBC licence fee. He said: [Lineker] can say what he likes. The issue is that the BBC is the state broadcaster and that it’s funded by a tax on televisions. If it weren’t, then we wouldn’t need to worry about its impartiality. Actually, if we change the funding mechanism of the BBC, we could have a much freer media, as they do in the United States, where people are allowed to say what they think. I think that would be much better rather than this pretence that the BBC is impartial, which it isn’t, and then having rows about particular presenters. Asked about the licence fee at the morning lobby briefing, the No 10 spokesperson said: We remain committed to the licence fee for the rest of the current charter. But we’ve been clear that the BBC’s funding model faces major challenges due to changes in the way people consume media. And it’s necessary to look at ways to ensure long-term sustainability. The BBC’s current charter runs out in 2027. At the No 10 lobby briefing the spokesperson said the government was glad that the BBC’s dispute with Gary Lineker had been resolved. He said: We’re pleased that this situation has been resolved and that fans will be able to watch Match of the Day as normal this weekend. The spokesperson repeated the line used previously about Rishi Sunak being “disappointed” by the language used by Lineker in relation to the government’s small boats policy, and the rhetoric used by ministers, but the spokesperson declined to say Lineker should apologise. The spokesperson also declined to offer full backing to Richard Sharp, the BBC chair (and Sunak’s former boss at Goldman Sachs). No 10 is still waiting for the outcome of the review into the appointment process being carried out by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, the spokesperson said. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, told Sky News this morning that the extra £5bn for defence announced by Rishi Sunak was not enough. Pointing out that Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, was lobbying for twice that sum, Ellwood said that extra £5bn, although welcome, would not reverse the cuts to defence spending in the last defence review. He also claimed that countries like Russia and China would be “breathing a sigh of relief”. He said: The next couple of years are going to get very, very dangerous indeed. This year particularly, 2023, will be critical for Ukraine. Britain has done brilliantly in stepping forward, pushing the envelope, because we have become rather risk averse, too timid, in dealing with aggressive nations such as Russia and China. But we can only do that with the hard power. And I think Russia and China will be breathing a sigh of relief that we have not invested further in our armed forces at this time. We are at the foothills of another cold war. Globalisation in its current form is actually dying. And it’s countries like Britain that usually step forward and other nations follow. We can only do that if we invest further in our defence. There are no urgent questions in the Commons today, which means James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, will deliver his statement on “IR23”, the update to the integrated defence and security review, at 3.30pm. After that is over, Andrew Griffith, a Treasury minister, will give a statment on the sale of the UK arm of the Silicon Valley Bank. The Foreign Office has confirmed that, as part of the integrated defence and security review update being published today, BBC World Service will get an extra £20m. It says this will protected its 42 language services for the next two years. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said: As the world’s most trusted international broadcaster, the BBC World Service is a vital tool in providing accurate and impartial news, analysis and discussion in 42 languages to 365 million people around the world each week. This one-off funding will allow the BBC World Service to maintain its unrivalled status as the world’s largest international broadcaster, and to continue playing its crucial role in tackling harmful disinformation through providing trusted, impartial news and analysis globally. Last year the Foreign Office said it was spending £94m a year on the World Service. MPs will vote on the illegal migration bill at 10pm tonight after the second reading debate. In a clear and hard-hitting report on the legislation, the Institute for Government thinktank says there are seven questions ministers need to answer to explain how it might work. The IfG says: Without increased capacity to remove people, classifying ever more arrivals as inadmissible will not help the government reduce the backlog or the money spent on accommodation – or improve public trust in the immigration system. And at a human level, it has the potential to cause serious harm to vulnerable people. Keir Starmer has urged the government to negotiate an end to the strike by junior doctors taking place in England today. He said: The way to resolve strikes is to get around the table and to negotiate and compromise and come to a settlement. That’s what the government needs to do. Many people will be really anxious today. They know there isn’t full emergency cover, they know that operations are now going to be cancelled, including in serious areas like cancer. So the anxiety this will put upon people who rely on the NHS is huge. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has rejected a claim by Labour that taxes are higher in Scotland for higher earners because the SNP has mismanaged the economy. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, made that claim on a visit to Scotland. As the Times reports, Reeves said: The way I see it is the last Labour government was able to keep taxes low and invest in public services and we were able to do it because we grew the economy. When Labour was last in power — and we were in for 13 years —the average growth rate per year was 2.1%. The average growth rate the last 13 years under the Tories has been 1.4%. And taxes are at the highest level of being in the UK for 70 years. The Conservatives have become a high-tax party and the SNP too because they become low-growth parties … We’ve got to grow the economy. In response, Sturgeon said taxes were higher for higher earners in Scotland because the Scottish government was more committed to redistribution than the UK government. She said the fact that Labour did not support the SNP on this showed it was “Tory-lite”. Increasingly the Scottish government has been using its powers under devolution to set income tax rates that are different from those applying in the rest of the UK. In a recent report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies explained the difference. It said: The Scottish income tax system has more bands and different rates compared with the rest of the UK. The effect is that income tax liabilities are a very small amount lower in Scotland for those on less than £28,000 per year, but greater for those on higher incomes – sometimes by quite large margins. For example, someone on £50,000 will pay £1,550 more tax in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, and someone on £150,000 will pay £3,900 more, in the coming tax year. The IFS report also backed up Sturgeon’s analysis. It said the Scottish government had used its powers “to make the system more progressive, as well as to raise more revenue to fund public services”. Keir Starmer has said Richard Sharp should resign as chair of the BBC. As ITV reports, this morning Starmer said: I think Richard Sharp’s position is increasingly untenable. I think most people watching the complete mess of the last few days would say how on earth is he still in position and Gary Lineker has been taken off air? This is a mess of the BBC’s own making, they need to sort it out and sort it out fast. As Jessica Elgot reports, Starmer is echoing what Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said yesterday. Powell also described Sharp’s position at “increasingly untenable”. Even before the Gary Lineker row erupted, Sharp was already facing calls for his resignation because, when applying for the job of BBC chair, he did not disclose his role in helping Boris Johnson get access to a loan facility, reportedly worth around £800,000. Here is the No 10 readout of the meeting between Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese, his Australian counterpart, in San Diego last night. They agreed Aukus was “an unprecedented endeavour which will protect our people and support our defence industrial bases for generations to come”, No 10 says. Richard Dannatt, a peer and a former head of the army, has told the Sun he does not think the extra £5bn for defence announced today (see 9.24am) goes far enough. He told the paper: This government is beginning to look like an ostrich over defence spending. The parallels to the 1930s grow stronger – a threat from a dictator in Europe and a refusal to reinvest or rearm. Junior hospital doctors in England started a 72-hour strike this morning. My colleagues Denis Campbell and Aubrey Allegretti have the story. This morning Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the BMA’s council, claimed that, paradoxically, hospitals could be safer than normal, because elective operations won’t be taking place and because more senior doctors, consultants, would be covering for the doctors on strike. He told the Today programme: What is going to happen over this next three days is that we are going to see senior doctors – I don’t like the words junior and senior, this is just a level of experience and training – so we’re seeing consultants and specialist doctors cover. They will stop, or should stop, their elective work and actually the NHS is maintaining a great deal of elective work. So we should see that the service is safe. In fact, actually, we should see it is even safer than normal. Asked to explain that, he said: Because the care is going to be given by consultants, consultants seeing patients, doing things that they normally wouldn’t do. The SNP leadership debate on Sky News this evening will start at 7pm, not 8pm, as the agenda originally stated. I’ve corrected that now. Some sources were wrongly saying 8pm. This is from Jonathan Beale, the BBC’s defence correspondent, on today’s defence spending announcement. (See 9.24am.) My colleague Caroline Davies will be covering all the details of the Gary Lineker story, and the BBC’s climbdown, on a separate live blog. Lineker has responded to the BBC announcement in a Twitter thread starting here. And he is still speaking out in defence of refugees. Tim Davie, the BBC director general, has issued a statement announcing that Gary Lineker is going back on air. In it he says that there are “grey areas” in the corporation’s guidance on the use of social media, that this has caused “potential confusion”, and he adds: “I apologise for this”. He says the guidelines will be reviewed by an independent expert, with a particular focus on how they should apply to freelance broadcasters operating outside news and current affairs (such as Lineker). The guidelines should be “clear, proportionate and appropriate”, he says. Sky’s Rob Harris has tweeted the full statement. Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence editor, has written an analysis of the defence spending announcement (see 9.24am) and the integrated review update. Here is an extract. China, previously “a systemic competitor” – a phrase generally useful, if unmemorable – has upgraded to presenting an “epoch-defining challenge” – as a nod to the Conservative backbenchers who had wanted Beijing to be designated as a threat, similar to that used to describe Russia. This, in fact, was Truss’s reason for reopening the integrated review, to make such an aggressive re-designation that would only have further inflamed already fraught relations with Beijing. Epoch-defining is a large notion, not least because epochs tend to be very long, while integrated reviews emerge every two years, and if Labour wins, the party is likely to want to refocus on Russia, if, that is, the US allows them. Nevertheless “epoch-defining” also suggests the world is becoming a different kind of unsafe place. Islamist fundamentalism is in retreat, fallen sharply after the territorial defeat of Islamic State and the killing of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In its place is a rapprochement between Russia and China, state actors with larger budgets, more weaponry and sophisticated tools at their disposal. This thinking underlies Sunak’s announcement to recommit to a target of lifting defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”, similar to what was announced by Johnson at the last Nato summit in June, one of his last acts before his premiership collapsed. Johnson, however, put a target date – 2030 – on when the pledge would be met, and Sunak has not. And here is the full article. The government has struck a last-minute deal for HSBC to buy Silicon Valley Bank’s UK operations, saving thousands of British tech startups and investors from big losses after the biggest bank failure since 2008, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more coverage on his business live blog. According to Rob Harris from Sky News, Gary Lineker will return to his Match of the Day presenting job on the BBC. Harris also claims that Lineker will get some sort of apology from the BBC. Lineker was taken off air at the weekend, prompting many of his football presenter colleagues to stage what was in effect a mini-strike in solidarity, after a tweet criticising the language used by ministers about the government’s illegal migration bill prompted both Tory fury and claims he had breached BBC impartiality guidelines. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is in San Diego, California, where today he will meet Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, for an Aukus meeting. Aukus is the Australia/US/UK security pact, primarily focused on providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarine capacity. It was set up when Boris Johnson was prime minister, and now provides him with the material for one of his most over-used jokes. The meeting will coincide with the publication of the government’s update (or “refresh”, as it is officially called) to the integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy first published in 2021. Liz Truss ordered the update during her short-lived premiership, because she wanted it to take a tougher line on China. IR23, as the “refresh” is also called by No 10, will be published this afternoon. Overnight, Sunak announced that the Ministry of Defence will get an extra £5bn over the next two years as part of the review, and that the government is committing to raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”. In a news release No 10 says: The 2023 integrated review refresh [IR23] confirms that an additional £5bn will be provided to the Ministry of Defence over the next two years, to help replenish and bolster vital ammunition stocks, modernise the UK’s nuclear enterprise and fund the next phase of the Aukus submarine programme. It follows a £24bn four-year uplift in defence spending in 2020, the largest sustained increase since the cold war. The prime minister will also set out an ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP in the longer term, and the UK will lead a conversation with Allies on future posture and burden sharing at the Nato summit in Lithuania this summer. We will review defence spending after 2025 in light of this ambition. As my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports, Conservative MPs are particularly interested in what IR23 will say about China and, speaking to reporters on his flight to California, Rishi Sunak said it was too simplistic just to categorise China as a “threat” (which is what China hawks in his party want). Sunak said: I don’t think it’s kind of smart or sophisticated foreign policy to reduce our relationship with China – which, after all, is a country with 1.5bn people, the second biggest economy, and member of the UN security council – to just two words. That’s why in the integrated review you will see a very thoughtful and detailed approach to China … I think [China] presents an epoch-defining challenge to us and to the global order. Aubrey’s full story is here. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer is doing a visit ahead of the budget on Wednesday. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is due to make a Commons statement about the integrated review refresh. Around 3.30pm UK time: Rishi Sunak records a series of broadcast interviews in San Diego. After 5.30pm: MPs start the second reading debate for the illegal migration bill. 7pm: Sky News hosts a debate for the SNP leadership candidates. 7.30pm: Sunak meets Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian PM, at the Aukus meeting. Sunak will also have a bilateral meeting with Biden. I’ll try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com. DBDC",
                "A DB-DC “peace rally” due to take place in Berlin this weekend condemning western weapons exports to Ukraine has been criticised by the leadership of the leftwing party Die Linke for failing to distance itself from far-right groups that have announced their attendance. Police expect about 10,000 people to take part in Saturday’s rally in front of the Brandenburg Gate, which is co-organised by a renegade former leader of Die Linke, Sahra Wagenknecht. A counter-protest supported by politicians and public intellectuals including the Nobel literature prize-winner Herta Müller has been registered in Berlin for Friday afternoon. In a TV interview on Wednesday, Wagenknecht said she did not want to see neo-Nazi symbols at her protest, but she fell short of uninviting groups of a nationalist persuasion. “We have made clear that rightwing extremist symbols have no place at this rally,” she told the public broadcaster ZDF. “But of course, everyone is welcome who wants to demonstrate for peace with an open heart.” Wagenknecht set out the theme for her rally in a “manifesto for peace” published earlier this month, in which she argued that western military support for Ukraine’s defensive effort was merely prolonging a conflict that would inevitably be settled at the negotiating table. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s demands for fighter jets and long-range missiles could drag Germany into a nuclear war, it warned. The manifesto’s original 70-odd signees were mostly prominent figures of the soft-left western German peace movement of the 1970s and 80s, including the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey, the centre-left EU commissioner Günter Verheugen, and the former head of the German Protestant church Margot Kässmann. The open letter’s co-author, the journalist Alice Schwarzer, was once Germany’s most prominent feminist icon. In the weeks since its release, however, the manifesto has also been embraced by the far right. Among the half a million signatures since added to the online petition is that of Tino Chrupalla, a co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, while a link to the manifesto has been shared online by Hans-Christian Strache, the disgraced former leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom party. Groups from the rightwing extremist spectrum, including Saxony’s Freie Jugend youth movement and the neo-fascist magazine Compact, have encouraged participation in Saturday’s gathering on their social media channels. While Wagenknecht’s condemnation of such support has remained ambiguous, her party has distanced itself from the event. “After intensive consultation, the party leadership has decided not to join this callout,” said Die Linke’s federal chair, Tobias Bank, criticising the lack of a clearly drawn line of separation from “well-known Nazis” mobilising supporters for the rally. Kässmann also announced she would not join the rally, decrying the lack of condemnation of “nationalist and misanthropic persons and groups”. Even without their participation, Saturday’s rally is likely to mark a further fusion of old left and nationalist protest groups, which was a hallmark of the Querdenker protests against lockdown measures and vaccine mandates during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last weekend, a rally organised by the Querdenker scene mobilised about 10,000 protesters outside the annual Munich Security Conference, police said. A second protest march made up mainly of leftwing protesters drew about 2,700 people. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Berlin in protest. Organisers had expected 20,000. Days before the invasion, Wagenknecht portrayed the threat as an invention of western media, telling the broadcaster ARD: “We can be happy that Putin isn’t what he is portrayed to be, namely a crazy Russian nationalist who gets high on moving borders. If that were so, negotiations would probably be pointless.” According to a survey by the pollster Forsa released on Wednesday, only 22% of Germans believe Putin is interested in negotiations, though a majority of AfD supporters hold that view.",
                //"Good evening, we are closing this live blog now. You can read our full report on the UN vote here. The UN voted by 141 to 7 with 32 abstentions to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, a sign that the international community has not wavered in its determination to condemn Russia’s actions. In the last vote taken immediately after Russia had annexed republics in the east of Ukraine, Russia was condemned 143 to five with 35 abstentions, the bulk of these in Africa. Applause broke out when the result was announced. Russia had worked hard to try to end its isolation by pointing to the damage the west was caused by pouring arms into the region or by pointing to the growing hunger crisis that it blamed on western sanctions. Ukraine foreign minister Dymotro Kuleba said: By voting in favour of today’s UNGA resolution 141 UN member states made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be restored. One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong. The seven countries voting against the resolution were Belarus, Mali, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea. The resolution was adopted after amendments proposed by Belarus that would have stripped much of the language were resoundingly defeated. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity, a basic principle of the UN charter that all countries must subscribe to when they join the world organisation. China abstained as the UN passed a nonbinding resolution calling for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine. It also called for a halt to fighting and for peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The 141-7 vote with 32 abstentions, which included China, was slightly below the highest vote for the five previous resolutions approved by the 193-member world body since Russia sent troops and tanks across the border into its smaller neighbour. After the year-long Russian invasion of Ukraine, drone footage shows the scale of destruction in Bakhmut. The Russian military has increased its attacks around the eastern city before the 24 February anniversary. Drone footage shows rows of destroyed and burned out buildings, with no civilians in sight. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. In a debate at the UN general assembly marking the anniversary of the invasion and seen as a key barometer of the state of world opinion, China intervened to present itself as above the conflict by proposing a catalogue of measures: a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians and the upholding of territorial integrity. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said countries like India and South Africa, which have not joined the West in denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, were likely on a trajectory away from alignment with Moscow but that process would not happen “in one fell swoop”. “There are countries that have longstanding, decades-long relationships with Russia, with the Soviet Union before, that are challenging to break off in one fell swoop. It’s not flipping a light switch, it’s moving an aircraft carrier,” Blinken said in an interview with The Atlantic, marking the one year anniversary of the war. India has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow after Russian invaded Ukraine. New Delhi has thus far resisted that pressure, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and its economic and oil needs, Reuters reported. Russia has been India’s largest weapons supplier since the Soviet Union days. However, Washington in recent years has looked to woo New Delhi away from its traditional military supplier. India is desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power after concerns over Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war. “India for decades had Russia at the core of providing military equipment to it and its defenses, but what we’ve seen over the last few years is a trajectory away from relying on Russia and moving into partnership with us and other countries,” Blinken said. Ukraine’s supporters urged the UN general assembly to vote for a resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from its neighbour on the eve of the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion. The draft resolution is all but certain to pass later in the day but is nonbinding, the Associated Press reported. Diplomats from Ukraine’s allies seek to win over more nations that have been ambivalent toward the war in previous votes, including China. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Venezuela’s deputy ambassador addressed the council on behalf of 16 countries that either voted against or abstained on almost all of five previous resolutions on Ukraine: Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Laos, Mali, Nicaragua, North Korea, St. Vincent, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. While other countries focused on Russia’s actions, deputy ambassador Joaquín Pérez Ayestarán said Wednesday that all countries without exception “must stringently comply with the United Nations Charter.” He said the countries in his group were against what he called divisive action in the general assembly, and for “a spirit of compromise.” In his own appeal, Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau said Ukrainians deserve “not only our compassion, but also our support and solidarity.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The EU’s top diplomats have failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has said “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them.,” she told reporters in India. Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” Sánchez confirmed that Spain will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “ Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, according to a report. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, the US army secretary Christine Wormuth said. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The White House has said Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and will announce a new wave of sanctions against Russia. The leaders of the 27 EU countries have issued a joint statement on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, vowing not to rest until Ukraine prevails, is rebuilt and “justice is done”. Ukraine is “part of our European family” and its people have shown “resolve in defending democracy and freedom, resilience in the face of hardship and dignity when confronted with Russia’s crimes”, the statement reads. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in political, economic, humanitarian, financial and military terms, including through swift coordinated procurement from European industry. We will also support Ukraine’s reconstruction, for which we will strive to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets in accordance with EU and international law. We will further increase collective pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression. The EU and its partners have acted “swiftly and in unity” and will continue to stand firmly and in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people “for as long as it takes”, it continues. We support President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Together with our international partners, we will make sure that Ukraine prevails, that international law is respected, that peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders are restored, that Ukraine is rebuilt, and that justice is done. Iran will abstain from a UN general assembly vote on the draft resolution calling for Russia to unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, my colleague Patrick Wintour writes. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the resolution later today, although China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. Ukraine’s central bank has unveiled a commemorative banknote to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. One side of the 20-hryvnia (£.0.45) note shows three soldiers raising the national flag, while the other side features an image of two hands tied with tape, an apparent allusion to the alleged war crimes that Ukraine has accused Russian forces of committing. Ukraine’s national bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, said during a presentation in Kyiv: To mark the anniversary of the war, we decided to launch a commemorative banknote which will depict on a small piece of paper a year of emotions, patterns, content and iconic things. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has confirmed that his country will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “That’s why we’re stepping up our military contributions and that’s why my government announced its decision on Wednesday to send six Leopard tanks.” Speaking on Thursday during his second visit since Russia invaded almost a year ago, he also underlined Spain’s commitment to Ukraine and to the 165,000 Ukrainian refugees it has taken in over the past 12 months. Sánchez said that Ukraine – unlike its enemy – was “fighting for what is right and it knows what it’s fighting for”. He added: Ukraine is fighting for its survival while your enemy is fighting for power. Its fight is not honourable; yours is a song of freedom. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, CNN quotes the US army secretary Christine Wormuth as saying. The US army is “looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians”, she said. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks, I will say that. None of the options that we’re exploring are weeks or two months. There are longer timelines involved. But I think there are options that are less than two years, less than a year and a half. But again we have to look at the pros and cons of each of them. Among the options being presented to the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, were building tanks “from scratch”, she said. She added that another option would include “countries that we’ve sold tanks to previously”, which could “presumably get tanks to the Ukrainians more quickly but might disrupt relations with important allies”. Earlier we reported that four people have been arrested in London on suspicion of criminal damage, after the campaign group Led By Donkeys painted a Ukrainian flag on the road outside the Russian embassy. Here’s the clip: China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has told the UN general assembly that one year into the Ukraine war, “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said China’s position on Ukraine has been “consistent and clear”. Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, he said, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. On the subject of nuclear war, Dai said “all parties should strictly abide by nuclear conventions”, adding: Nuclear weapons cannot be used, nuclear war cannot be fought. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. He said: What the Ukrainians want is F-16s. As it happens, we don’t have F-16s but we do have Typhoons. I think there’s an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons. If it’s a question of training people up to use those machines – we can do that. The consequences of a Russian victory would be Vladimir Putin’s ability to threaten the Baltic states, and that the UK’s security would be “much more gravely in peril”. On the subject of China, Johnson said Beijing would be making an “historic mistake” if it supplied Moscow with weapons and that he was “very concerned” to see China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, meet Vladimir Putin yesterday. Why does China want to be contaminated by association with Putin, who has revealed himself to be this gangster and adventurer? I think it would be a big, big mistake by China. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said Ukraine has become the centre of the European continent in a video address ahead of the first year anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Many had predicted that Kyiv would fall “in a matter of days” when it was invaded by Moscow’s troops last February, but this did not account for “the moral and the physical courage” of Ukraine’s people, she said. Europe “is with you”, she said, addressing the Ukrainian people. We have been with you in this existential fight from the beginning. We have massively stepped up our economic, humanitarian and military support. Because Ukraine has become the centre of our continent, the place where our values are upheld, where our freedom is defended, where the future of Europe is written. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says he and the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, discussed ways to end Russian aggression based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law. Posting to Twitter, Kuleba said he commended Guterres’ efforts to enable the Black Sea Grain Initiative which he said “will go down in history as his legacy”. Meeting in Brussels, the EU’s top diplomats failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU aimed to have the measures in place by 24 February. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. The latest package would ban the export of components for drones and helicopters and spare parts for vehicles, items that were found on the battlefields of Ukraine and had been missed off previous ones. The search for consensus came as British, US and EU officials met on Thursday to share information about sanctions, amid a growing international push to curb apparent Russian attempts to dodge the restrictions with the help of its neighbours. Following the start of western sanctions in February 2022, exports from Europe and the US to Russia fell sharply, but some trade has been rerouted to former Soviet states in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Western exports to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia have increased dramatically, with smaller but noticeable increases to Kazakhstan and Georgia, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Western officials fear this trade is being sent on to Russia, which has also seen a jump in imports from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates since the war began. Officials are now studying on a case-by-case basis how to prevent any sanctions dodging, via a mix of persuasion or threats to cut market access. Earlier this week ten EU countries called for a crackdown on Russia’s attempts to source military parts from front companies in neighbouring countries, with threats to cut off access to the EU market to companies and individuals involved in such trade. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them.,” she told reporters in India. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, according to a report. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the Russian state-run Tass news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. The exact cause of the blast remains unclear. Russia blamed Ukraine for the explosion, but Kyiv has not claimed responsibility. In a statement posted to Telegram, Khusnullin said: All lanes of the Crimean bridge are fully open to car traffic 39 days ahead of schedule. He said the reopening of the bridge was a “big gift for the Defender of the Fatherland Day” national holiday celebrated in Russia today. He added that “work was carried out round-the-clock” by around 500 people to complete the repairs, and that other parts of the bridge were still being restored. The EU should consider appointing a full-time commissioner to oversee the drafting and enforcing of sanctions so they can be used effectively against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told the Guardian in an interview. He was speaking in London as he met the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to discuss the summer Nato summit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, where the Baltic states will press for progress on Ukraine’s Nato application and for more to be done to defend the bloc’s European flank. He said he was frustrated with the number of exemptions to sanctions, saying “sometimes we derogate so much that we can call this a hole in a ship that can sink the ship”. He cited the derogations from sanctions provided in September for coal, cement and wood on the basis that they were linked to protecting food security. There needs to be a clearer explanation of these derogations. In some cases there may be a link, but when we talk about cement, I am sorry, I cannot find the link with food security. While EU officials had been appointed to check how sanctions were being implemented, Landsbergis argued, “sanctions are becoming so important to the EU single market that we may need to go further and make sanctions policy a political portfolio”. Read the full story here: The UN’s general assembly is meeting for a second day ahead of a vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly will vote on the motion, backed by Kyiv and its allies, to mark the first anniversary of Moscow’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour, which UN secretary general António Guterres denounced as an “attack on our collective conscience”. In an address marking the start of the session yesterday, Guterres warned of a further escalation of the war, and referred to “indirect threats” of the use of nuclear weapons and “irresponsible” military actions in the vicinity of nuclear power plants. The assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. You can watch the vote and the preceding debate live here: Unlike the UN’s security council, Russia has no veto right in the general assembly. The resolutions are not binding under international law. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the assembly has passed a series of resolutions condemning its actions. In March last year, 141 of the 193 UN member states voted in favour of a resolution calling Russia to withdraw from Ukraine “immediately” In April, the assembly decided with a much narrower majority of 93 votes to suspend Russia’s UN human rights council membership in Geneva. In October, 143 member states condemned Russia’s “illegal annexations” of Ukraine’s Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Anna and her husband left Russia after Putin’s mobilisation. She told Clea Skopeliti of the difficulties in Turkey and the potential dangers of moving back. “A few months after leaving Russia, I came back to Moscow. We’re still figuring out what to do. We’re considering moving back to Russia because we can’t afford living in Turkey, since the rouble has become much weaker. “But it’s not safe. There could be another mobilisation at any moment, and we worry my husband could be drafted because he has an engineering background. It is so hard to make all those decisions when there are so many things you don’t know. I’m really scared of him being drafted because if they take you, there’s nothing you can do. There are two options: war or jail.” Read more here: Here are the latest images from Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China, Reuters reports. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Thursday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. The announcement came days after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned China of consequences if it provided material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Stoltenberg told Reuters: We haven’t seen any supplies of lethal aid from China to Russia, but we have seen signs that they are considering and may be planning for that …That’s the reason why the United States and other allies have been very clear, warning against that. And China should of course not support Russia’s illegal war. There was no immediate comment from China, but its foreign ministry said earlier on Thursday that any potential intelligence on arms transfer by China to Russia that the US planned to release was just speculation. The Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Isobel Koshiw, Pjotr Sauer, Morten Risberg, Liz Cookman and Luke Harding revisited one of the grimmest chapters of Russia’s war – the ruin of Mariupol. For more than 80 days, the Russians bombarded Mariupol, determined to take the port city even if they had to raze it to the ground first. After Russian forces finally crushed Ukrainian resistance last May, they set about putting their stamp on Mariupol, erasing evidence of the recent atrocities and of past Ukrainian history in the city. A year on from the invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian tells the story of Mariupol – perhaps the bloodiest and most shocking chapter of Russia’s brutal war.

In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”, Reuters reports. “Otherwise Russia circumvents the sanctions system and the effects risk falling short of our expectations,” the minister added. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Announcing the new support on the first anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the government said the sanctions would also target “those spreading mistruths to justify this war”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Read more here: Earlier we reported that the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, had stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine during a news conference in India. Yellen also told journalists that talks between the US and China on economic issues would resume at “an appropriate time”, while warning Beijing that providing any material support to Moscow’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. On the subject of US sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, she said: We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us. And we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them. The warning came a day after China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The convictions were for crimes including rape and murder, the shelling of residential buildings, cruel treatment of civilians and pillaging, she said. More than 71,000 alleged war crimes have been registered in Ukraine since 24 February 2022, she said. The “atrocities and destruction” caused by Russia were “colossal and endless”, she said during a briefing. Millions of people have been forced to leave everything behind. Massive missile attacks are destroying the civilian infrastructure and many tragically lost their lives. This damage cannot be undone, but what we can do is to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. Ukraine’s law enforcement agencies are being assisted in war crimes investigations by dozens of countries and institutions. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians. Anti-war protesters in London poured yellow and blue paint on to the road outside the Russian embassy to create a giant Ukrainian flag before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion. The campaign group Led By Donkeys halted traffic before spreading more than 300 litres of paint across the road, using wheelbarrows and brushes to make the 500 square metre flag. In a statement, the group said Ukraine was “an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination”, adding: The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside Putin’s embassy in London will serve to remind him of that. The group said the non-toxic, solvent-free and fast-dry edible paint was washable and designed for road art. Four people – three men and one woman – were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway, the Metropolitan police said. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. An indictment was submitted last Friday to Gdansk district court against the suspect, a spokesperson for the Gdansk district prosecutor’s office said in a statement. They said the Russian citizen’s “espionage activity was focused on military units located in the north-eastern part of Poland, as part of which he carried out tasks of reconnaissance of important elements of the Polish armed force”. The case was one of “several” concerning activity for the Russian and Belarusian intelligence services against the Polish military, they added. North Korean state media have marked the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by blaming Nato and calling the US’s involvement a “trail to self-destruction.” In comments to the state-run news agency KCNA, reported by Reuters, Kim Yoo-chul, described as an international affairs critic, said the conflict in Ukraine was the “inevitable product of coercion and hegemony” by the US and its allies. He wrote: If Ukraine had not blindly taken part in the US policy of anti-Russian confrontation, if it had abandoned the dirty demons of the United States and promoted reconciliation and unity with its neighbours, the situation would not have reached the point where it is as bad as it is now. The current situation in Ukraine once again proves that there can be no peace in the world at any time unless the United States’ policy of force, tyranny and greedy aggression … is ended. North Korea has forged close ties with Russia since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has publicly supported Moscow in statements as well as at the UN, and has expressed support for Russia’s proclaimed annexation of parts of Ukraine. Here are some images we have received of Ukrainian army volunteers receiving Challenger tank training at a military base in southern England. Based on the UK’s basic soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and the law of armed conflict. Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said a series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia after the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The attacks, which caused limited damage due to strong cyber-defence systems being in place, were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, which wrote on Telegram that Italy was “Russiaphobic”, while referring to the government’s approval of a sixth military aid package for Ukraine. Tajani made the comments to reporters on the sidelines of the UN’s emergency special session in New York marking one year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Meloni met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday on her first visit to Ukraine since she came to power in October. Meloni pledged that Italy would continue to give “military, financial and civil support”. “Those who support Ukraine, even militarily, are those who work for peace,” she said. Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air, Reuters reports. The Russian leader, who has in recent days has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control, invoked the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany to argue that Russia needed modernised armed forces to guarantee its sovereignty. It comes after he said Russia would halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US. In his address today, Putin said the Sarmat silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be deployed this year. The RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fueled missile has been in development for years. Russia said it had test-launched the missile in April 2022. The US believes Russia carried out a test of the Sarmat just before President Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv earlier this week and that the test failed, CNN has reported. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on that report. In addition, Putin said Russia would continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and would start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles. In remarks issued by the Kremlin earlier today, Putin said: With the adoption of the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine project ‘Emperor Alexander III’ into the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100%. Emperor Alexander III, first launched in December, is the seventh Borei-A class submarine and can each carry 16 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Putin said Russia would develop all parts of Russia’s conventional armed forces, improve training, add advanced equipment, bolster the arms industry and promote soldiers who had proven themselves in battle. He said: A modern, efficient army and navy are a guarantee of the country’s security and sovereignty, a guarantee of its stable development and its future. Therefore, we will continue to pay priority attention to strengthening our defence capability. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the live blog from Geneva Abdul. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian comedian Vasyl Baidak sparks an unlikely and enduring friendship with retiree Iryna Terekhova when he joins a group of young people from Kyiv to rebuild her home, in a new Guardian documentary. Terekhova, a devout Orthodox Christian, lives in a farming village in the Chernihiv region. Her house was destroyed during the Russian occupation of March 2022. She reflects on a traumatic time when she was forced to share her cellar with Russian soldiers who said they had come to liberate her, but who devastated her village. Refusing to leave the area where she has lived most of her life, Terekhova is galvanised by the entrepreneurial spirit of the young Kyiv builders, while Baidak proves that humour is the vital ingredient to bolster their collective spirit. “I wait for the war to end, that’s when our new year will begin. For now, 2022 still continues,” concludes Iryna. Hello and welcome to those now following today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. It’s 1pm in Kyiv. On the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Vladimir Putin has threatened to strengthen Russia’s nuclear forces. His comments were released before an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. And Nato’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, says the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The UN general assembly is expected to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory by a massive majority. But China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said, according to Reuters. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry said, according to Reuters. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. A Russian fighter plane crashed and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, on Thursday . The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage. Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, the country’s defence minister said. Moldova dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The US Treasury secretary stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. Janet Yellen said it was critical for the IMF to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine. ‘I think he is not going to stop’, the UK defence secretary has said of Vladimir Putin’s war. Ben Wallace said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year. PA news also reported that Wallace stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the UK MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Russia had set the goal of capturing all the territory it does not control in the two regions that make up the industrial Donbas area of eastern Ukraine by the summer, Reuters reports. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, he told a military briefing on the eve of Friday’s anniversary of the invasion. Gromov said: The enemy, having an advantage in the resource of human mobilisation, is deliberately intensifying hostilities in an effort to deplete the units of the armed forces of Ukraine … In the short term, it is important for the Kremlin to capture the key settlements in the Donetsk region, and in the future to capture [all of] the Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the summer. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, Reuters cites the country’s defence ministry as saying on Thursday. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. As reported earlier, the Czech government has announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: The Czech government has approved a further military aid shipment to Ukraine and will continue to send equipment from stocks, the defence minister, Jana Černochová, said on Thursday. Černochová did not disclose details of specific equipment being shipped, reports Reuters, but said the country had so far sent 38 tanks, 55 armoured vehicles, four aircraft and 13 self-propelled howitzers from its military reserves, alongside larger shipments from the private sector. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. On Wednesday, Yevgeny Prigozhin published a grisly image of dozens of men who he said had been killed because commanders including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, had withheld ammunition to spite him, Reuters reports. Neither man commented but the defence ministry rejected the charge. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. “So far it’s all on paper but, so we have been told, the principal documents have already been signed,” Prigozhin said. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the TASS news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. In a post on the Telegram messenger app, Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the emergency services and investigators were on the scene near the town of Valyuki, and the reason for the crash was being established. Mikhail Afanasyev wants your letters, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. The Russian journalist from Abakan in Siberia was jailed last year for writing about a small group of national guardsmen who had refused to fight in Ukraine. But Afanasyev remains defiant, while local supporters crowdfund thousands of dollars to pay off his legal fines. “It is the duty of every person to expand the horizon of freedom by his actions, so that light pours in and overcomes the darkness,” Afanasyev wrote from pre-trial detention in a letter to his supporters this month. “I really ask you to write to me, very much! It helps me a lot … I just want to be a journalist, faithful to my profession to the end and defend its values.” Read more of the story here: Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, its defence minister told the local news agency TT. The latest instalment Sweden has delivered to Ukraine since the invasion includes armoured infantry fighting vehicles, which the defence minister, Pal Jonson, told Reuters would be the country’s main contribution to Ukraine in terms of equipment for ground warfare. Sweden is also preparing to send Ukraine the advanced Archer artillery system to Ukraine, and support has been growing in the Swedish parliament for additionally contributing some of the country’s around 120 Leopard tanks. “We are open to that and we are in close dialogue with above all Germany about it,” Jonson was quoted by TT as saying. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm, Reuters reports. Earlier we reported on Russia’s defence ministry accusing Ukraine of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, citing reports from the RIA news agency. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The US Treasury secretary has stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. In remarks prepared for delivery to a news conference as G20 finance leaders gathered on the outskirts of the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, Janet Yellen said it was critical for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine, Reuters reports. As President Biden has said, we will stand with Ukraine in its fight – for as long as it takes. Continued, robust support for Ukraine will be a major topic of discussion during my time here in India. Yellen added: Our economic assistance is making Ukraine’s resistance possible by supporting the home front: funding critical public services and helping keep the government running. In the coming months, we expect to provide around $10bn in additional economic support for Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian founder of the Wagner mercenary group, was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, the FT reports. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. As part of anti-laundering checks, Prigozhin’s Russian lawyers forwarded the London-based law firm a copy of his passport and a gas bill in the name of his then 81-year-old mother, Violetta, for an address in St Petersburg, the FT reports. Discreet Law’s founder, Roger Gherson, said the firm “cannot comment on confidential communications with [its] former clients”. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: Hello and welcome to those now following today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. It’s 10am in Kyiv. On the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Vladimir Putin has threatened to strengthen Russia’s nuclear forces. His comments were released before an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. And Nato’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, says the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The UN general assembly is expected to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory by a massive majority. But China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: ‘I think he is not going to stop’: UK defence secretary on Putin’s war. Ben Wallace has said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year. PA news also reported that Wallace stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Arriving in the Ukrainian capital, Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the UK MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. “China did not consult with us,” the official told reporters. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience”, at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Biden vowed that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory, ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. All members of the B9 have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing would play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a concert marking Defenders of the Fatherland Day. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. On Thursday 2 February, my friend Pete Reed died as he tried to evacuate civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, writes Cengiz Yar. Based on footage we now have of the incident, his vehicle was hit by a Russian anti-tank missile. He was killed in the blast, and others in his team were severely injured. Reports suggest it was likely a double-tap strike, a technique used frequently by Russia in Syria, where an attack is made to draw in additional support and recovery operations before a second attack is made. Pete was one of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. You should know a bit about the good he did in this world. I met him in the spring of 2016 over some drinks in Iraq, where I worked as a photographer. He was loud, a bit goofy, and trying to do some good. What good? He hadn’t quite figured that out yet. Read more by Cengiz Yar here: Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Arriving in the Ukrainian capital, Sánchez said: I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe. Sánchez, who last visited Ukraine in April, is understood to have travelled to Ukraine at Zelenskiy’s invitation. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year, PA news reports. When asked whether he could see the war continuing for another 12 months, Wallace told LBC: I think we will. I think Russia has shown a complete disregard, not only for the lives of the people of Ukraine but for its own soldiers. We are sitting here 12 months in and 188,000, actually more now, Russian soldiers are dead or injured as a result of this catastrophic miscalculation and aggression by President Putin. Wallace added: When someone has crossed the line and thinks it is OK to do that to your own people, running effectively a meat grinder for an army, I think he is not going to stop. He told LBC that planes currently held by Nato countries could be given to Ukraine, and he stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”, according to PA news. Wallace said: There is already talk, I think, of an eastern European country supplying MiG-29s … We’re not going to see Nato, we’re going to see countries that are members of Nato potentially put in air force equipment or MiG-29. The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. Colonel General Rustam Muradov, commander of Russia’s Eastern Group of forces, is likely to be under intense pressure to improve results in Vuhledar after harsh criticism from the Russian nationalist community, according to the MoD. “However, it is unlikely that Muradov has a striking force capable of achieving a breakthrough,” it said. Ukraine’s boxing federation has joined a growing boycott of the amateur world championships over the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian boxers, who have been allowed to compete with national flags and anthems. The FBU vice-president, Oleg Ilchenko, told the public broadcaster Suspline on Wednesday that its boxers would not compete in this year’s men’s and women’s championships, which will be held in New Delhi and Tashkent respectively. Both competitions are organised by the International Boxing Association, led by a Russian, Umar Kremlev. The United States, Ireland and Britain are among nine other federations that have boycotted the women’s event, while several have also pulled out of the men’s tournament. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukraine on Thursday of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, the RIA news agency reported. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority on Thursday to endorse a broad resolution demanding that Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraws from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regard as the west’s war. The resolution has been the subject of weeks of negotiations and has required Ukraine’s allies in the G7 to persuade Kyiv not to press for very specific wider demands and risk seeing some of the countries that have previously voted for Ukraine’s sovereignty peeling off. The last time the UN general assembly voted on the issue, 143 countries backed Ukraine and only five supported Russia. Ukraine has been warned that the number may slip to 135 in Thursday’s vote, marking the first anniversary of the war’s start, but Ukraine and its allies have been involved in last-minute high-level lobbying of countries such as Pakistan and India. Ukraine’s top diplomat Dmytro Kuleba said his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi shared “key elements of the Chinese peace plan” during their meeting in Germany earlier this week. “We are looking forward to receiving the text because this is not something that you can, you know, make your conclusions on just after hearing,” he added. Speaking at the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine was open to a conversation on the matter. “We are ready to talk with those who have ideas, other ideas which can help us achieve this goal,” he said. But the Ukrainian official warned on Wednesday that no peace plan should cross the “red lines” outlined by Kyiv. “The red lines are the principles of the UN charter, including respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the official said. “There will be no bargaining with any Ukrainian territories. The president [Volodymyr Zelenskiy] has already clearly said that.” The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. “China did not consult with us,” the official told reporters, including AFP. Beijing has promised to publish its proposed “political solution” to Ukraine conflict this week, in time for the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion of its neighbour. Nato’s chief said on Wednesday that the military alliance had seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also told the Associated Press in an interview that the alliance, while not a party to the war, would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Asked whether Nato had any indication that China might be ready to provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, Stoltenberg said: “We have seen some signs that they may be planning for that and of course Nato allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen. China should not support Russia’s illegal war.” Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “[direct] support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course [as] a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the UN charter, or international law.” On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin hosted the Chinese Communist party’s most senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, raising concern in the west that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support in the almost year-old war. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. “As before, we will pay increased attention to strengthening the nuclear triad,” Putin said in remarks issued early on Thursday morning by the Kremlin. The “triad” refers to nuclear missiles based on land, sea and in the air. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles - a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. “We will continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and will start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles,” Putin said.
